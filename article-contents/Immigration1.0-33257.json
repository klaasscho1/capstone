{"title": "Regulation Z; Docket No. R-1367Truth in LendingProposed rule; request for public comment.; RULEMAKING RELEASES", "body": "\nFor immediate release\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board on Thursday proposed significant changes to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) intended \nto improve the disclosuresconsumers receive in connection with closed-endmortgages and home-equity lines of \ncredit (HELOCs). These changes, offered for public comment, reflect the result of consumertesting conducted as \npart of the Board's comprehensive review of the rules for home-secured credit. The amendments would also \nprovide new consumer protections for all home-secured credit.\n\n\"Consumers need the proper tools to determine whether a particular mortgage loan is appropriate for their \ncircumstances,\" said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. \"It is often said that a home is a family's most \nimportant asset, and it is the Federal Reserve's responsibility to see that borrowers receive the information they \nneed to protect that asset.\"\n\nTo shop for and understand the cost of credit, consumers must be able to identify and understand the key terms of \nthe mortgage. In formulating the proposed revisions to Regulation Z, the Board used consumertesting to ensure \nthat the most essential information is provided at a suitable time using content and formats that are clear and \nconspicuous.\n\n\"Our goal is to ensure that consumers receive the information they need, whether they are applying for a fixed-\nratemortgage with level payments for 30 years, or an adjustable-rate mortgage with low initial payments that can \nincrease sharply,\" said Governor Elizabeth A. Duke. \"With this in mind, the disclosures would be revised to highlight \npotentially risky features such as adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, and negative amortization.\"\n\nClosed-endmortgagedisclosures would be revised to highlight potentially risky features such as adjustable rates, \nprepayment penalties, and negative amortization. The Board's proposal would:\n. Improve the disclosure of the annual percentage rate (APR) so it captures most fees and settlement costs paid by \nconsumers;\n. Require lenders to show how the consumer's APR compares to the average rate offered to borrowers with \nexcellent credit;\n. Require lenders to provide final Truth in Lending Act (TILA) disclosures so that consumers receive them at least \nthree business days before loan closing; and\n. Require lenders to show consumers how much their monthly payments might increase, for adjustable-rate \nmortgages.The Board will also work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make the \ndisclosures mandated by TILA, and HUD's disclosures, required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, \ncomplementary; potentially developing a single disclosure form that creditors could use to satisfy both laws.\n\nIn developing the proposed amendments, the Board recognized that disclosures alone may not always be sufficient \nto protect consumers from unfair practices. To prevent mortgage loan originators from \"steering\" consumers to \nmore expensive loans, the Board's proposal would:\n. Prohibit payments to a mortgage broker or a loan officer that are based on the loan's interest rate or other terms; \nand\n. Prohibit a mortgage broker or loan officer from \"steering\" consumers to transactions that are not in their interest in \n\n\norder to increase the mortgage broker's or loan officer's compensation.The rules for home-equity lines of credit \nwould be revised to change the timing, content, and format of the disclosures that creditors provide to consumers at \napplication and throughout the life of such accounts. Currently, consumers receive lengthy, generic disclosures at \napplication. Under the proposal, consumers would receive a new one-page Board publication summarizing basic \ninformation and risks regarding HELOCs at application. Shortly after application, consumers would receive new \ndisclosures that reflect the specific terms of their credit plans. In addition, the Board's proposal would:\n. Prohibit creditors from terminating an account for payment-related reasons unless the consumer is more than 30 \ndays late in making a payment.\n. Provide additional protections related to account suspensions and credit-limit reductions, and reinstatement of \naccounts.The Federal Register notices are attached. The comment periods end 120 days after publication of the \nproposals in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.\n\nHighlights of Proposed Rules Regarding Home-Secured Credit (14 KB PDF)\n\nStatement by Chairman Ben S.

At application, lenders would have to provide consumers with a one-page list of key questions to ask about \nthe loan being offered. The new Truth in Lending Act (TILA) disclosures are designed to answer those \nquestions.\n\n. The information consumers receive within three days after application would be streamlined to make it easier \nfor consumers to use. By highlighting risky mortgage features (such as possible payment increases, or \nnegative amortization) the disclosures would be more meaningful.\n\n\n\n. For adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders would be required to show consumers how their payments might \nchange, for example, by disclosing the highest monthly amount the consumer might pay during the life of the \nloan.\n\n. The APR would be revised to make it a better measure of the total cost of the loan, by including most fees \nand settlement costs; many of these fees are currently excluded from the APR.\n\n. The disclosures would show consumers in a simple graph how their loan's APR compares to the average \nrate offered to borrowers with excellent credit.\n\n. In addition to the early cost disclosures provided at application, lenders would be required to provide final \nTILA disclosures that consumers must receive at least three days before the loan closing.\n\n. For adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders would have to notify consumers 60 days in advance of a change in \ntheir monthly payment (currently notice may be given 25 days in advance).\n\n. For loans where consumers have payment options that allow their loan balance to increase, consumers would \nhave to receive monthly statements explaining this feature.For all mortgage transactions the proposal would:\n\n. Prohibit payments to a mortgage broker or the creditor's loan officer based on the loan's interest rate or other \nterms.\n\n. Prohibit a mortgage broker or loan officer from \"steering\" consumers to a lender offering less favorable terms in \norder to increase the broker's or loan officer's compensation.For Home-Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs):\n\n. At application, lenders would provide improved information that would be more meaningful and easier for \nconsumers to use. The lengthy, generic disclosure currently provided at application would be replaced with a \nnew, one-page disclosure summarizing basic information and risks about HELOCs.\n\n. Within three days after receiving the consumer's application, lenders would provide disclosures specifically \ntailored to the actual credit terms for which the consumer qualifies. These disclosures provide information \nabout costs and risky mortgage features in a tabular format that consumers have found easier to use.\n\n. At account opening, lenders would provide final disclosures in the same format, to facilitate comparison with \nthe earlier disclosures.\n\n. Throughout the life of the plan, lenders would provide enhanced periodic statements, showing the total \namount of interest and fees charged for the statement period and the year to date.\n\n. To the extent a lender can change any terms of the plan, lenders would have to notify consumers 45 days in \nadvance of the change.\n\n\n\n. Lenders would be prohibited from terminating an account for delinquency until the payment is more than 30 \ndays late.\n\n. Consumer protections that apply when a consumer's credit line has been suspended or reduced would be \nstrengthened. Creditors would have to provide additional information about the reasons for the action and \nconsumers' right to request reinstatement. The rules also would require lenders to promptly investigate and respond \nto consumers' request to have their lines reinstated.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nStatement by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke\nJuly 23, 2009\n\nWe are meeting today to consider two proposals that would significantly improve consumerdisclosures for all \nmortgage transactions. These proposals are the result of a comprehensive review conducted by the Board's staff, \nincluding extensive consumertesting. The proposals also include robust new consumer protections to prohibit unfair \npractices that allow mortgage brokers and other loan originators to increase consumers' loan costs unnecessarily.\n\nIn recent years, consumers have been presented with a wider choice of mortgage products. Although this has \nhelped many consumers find a loan tailored to their specific needs, it has also added complexity. This complexity \ncan make it difficult for consumers to understand and compare different loans. The regulatory proposals we are \nconsidering this morning would require consumerdisclosures that better reflect the complex features and the risks of \ntoday's mortgage products.\n\nBoth proposals would be issued under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The first proposal would make sweeping \nchanges to the disclosures for home-purchase loans, refinance loans, and other fixed-term, closed-endmortgage \nloans. The second proposal would enhance the disclosures for open-end, home equity lines of credit (known as \nHELOCs).\n\nConsumers need the proper tools to determine whether a particular mortgage loan is appropriate for their \ncircumstances. The Truth in Lending disclosures provide consumers with key information they need to evaluate \ntheir options. It is often said that a home is a family's most important asset, and it is the Federal Reserve's \nresponsibility to see that borrowers receive the information they need to protect that asset. Our consumertesting is \ndesigned to ensure this information will be presented in language consumers understand, in a format that is easy to \nuse, and at a suitable time.\n\nWhen disclosing the details of complex financial transactions, there is necessarily a trade-off While attempting to \nprovide complete and accurate information, we must not overload consumers with excess information they cannot \nuse Our consumertesting has aided us in striking a proper balance. But we have also learned that the one-page \nTruth in Lending disclosure that lenders currently use is not adequate to convey the features and risks of today's \ncomplex products. Because the proposed new disclosures are more risk-focused, in some cases they are lengthier. \nOur consumertesting shows, however, that the length of these disclosures is not as important as their functionality \nand usability.\n\nThe Board will continue to test these model disclosure forms with actual consumers. In refining the model \ndisclosures we will follow the same multi-disciplinary approach that was used to develop these proposals. To \nachieve the most effective results, we combine our consumertesting results with research on financial markets and \nindustry operations, our experience in bank supervision and handling consumer complaints, and our expertise in \nconsumer education. In addition, we conduct extensive outreach to other government agencies, consumer and \ncommunity groups, academia, and industry to gain a broad range of perspectives that inform our policy decisions.\n\nWe will also work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make our disclosures, mandated by \nthe Truth in Lending Act, and HUD's disclosures, required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, \ncompatible and complementary; potentially developing a single disclosure form that creditors could use to satisfy \nboth laws. This could help reduce information overload by eliminating some duplicative disclosures.\n\n\n\nWe realize that disclosures alone may not always sufficiently protect consumers from unfair practices. Last year, we \nissued rules prohibiting unfair practices in underwriting higher-priced subprime mortgages. In addition, the Board's \nrules addressed abuses by loan servicers and improper appraisal practices. The Board also committed to study \nways to resolve concerns about lenders' payment of \"yield spread premiums\" to mortgage brokers and other loan \noriginators. These payments by lenders increase loan originators' compensation when the originator arranges a \nloan that has a higher interest rate than the rate the consumer was qualified to obtain.\n\nConsumers rely on the professional expertise of brokers and other loan originators and expect that they will act \nfairly. Consumers' expectations of fair treatment are not met, however, when they are steered by their loan \noriginator to more expensive loans. Accordingly, the proposal we are considering today would go beyond \ndisclosures and adopt new substantive protections. One aspect of the proposal would require the loan originator to \nreceive the same compensation from a particular creditor regardless of the loan's rate or terms. Another provision \nwould seek to prevent loan originators from steering consumers to lenders offering more expensive loans that are \nnot in the consumer's interest so that the originator can increase its own compensation.\n\nIn closing, I want to thank the many members of the Board's staff from several divisions who contributed to these \nproposals, but particularly staff in the Board's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs who put forth \ntremendous effort in developing these important improvements in consumer protection.\n\nI will now turn to Governor Duke, who chairs the Board's Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs, to \ndiscuss the proposals in greater detail.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nStatement by Governor Elizabeth A. Duke\n\nJuly 23, 2009\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nThe Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs is pleased to bring these two proposals before the Board. At \nthe outset, I want to recognize the contribution that Governor Tarullo, my fellow committee member, made to this \neffort. His testimony before the Senate Banking Committee prevents him from joining us this morning.\n\nBefore I turn to staff for the details, I would like to highlight elements of the proposals and the process for their \ndevelopment.\n\nAs part of the Federal Reserve's comprehensive review of all disclosures provided to consumers under Truth in \nLending, substantial revisions to credit card disclosures were finalized in December, 2008. The proposals we will \nact on today are the next step in that process, covering closed-endmortgages and home-equity lines of credit. To \nensure that new disclosures are useful to consumers, we have used consumertesting to explore how consumers \nprocess information and understand important features of financial products. This has been quite an informative \nexercise. Through testing, we were able to get a better understanding of the way consumers identify and evaluate \nkey terms pertaining to the costs and risks of closed-endmortgages and home-equity lines of credit. The disclosure \nproposals that resulted from this process are quite risk focused.\n\nOur goal is to ensure that consumers receive the information they need, whether they are applying for a fixed-\nratemortgage with level payments for 30 years, or an adjustable-rate mortgage with low initial payments that can \nincrease sharply. With this in mind, the disclosures would be revised to highlight potentially risky features such as \nadjustable rates, prepayment penalties, and negative amortization. Consumers also need reliable cost information. \nTo this end, we propose revisions to both the form and timing of disclosures.\n\nSome of the most dramatic changes to disclosures would be:\n. At application, lenders would provide consumers with a one-page list of key questions to ask about the loan \noffered. The new disclosures are designed to answer those questions.\n. Lenders would be required to show consumers in a simple graph, how the consumer's APR compares to the \naverage rate offered to borrowers with excellent credit.\n\n\n\n. For adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders would be required to show consumers how their payments might change, \nfor example, by disclosing the highest monthly amount the consumer might pay during the life of the loan.\n. In addition to receiving cost disclosures three days after application, under the proposed rules, consumers must \nreceive an accurate final TILA disclosure at least three business days before the loan closing. This would give \nconsumers the opportunity to review the disclosures outside of the pressured environment of the loan closing and \neliminate last-minute surprises.The second proposal represents an entirely new disclosure regime for home-equity \nlines of credit (or HELOCs). The proposal addresses the timing, content, and format of the disclosures creditors \nprovide throughout the life of these credit plans.\n\nCurrently, consumers receive a lengthy disclosure when they apply for a home-equity line of credit. This is a pre-\nprinted, generic disclosure explaining how the creditor's program is structured. It is dense and legalistic, and \ndifficult for consumers to use This disclosure would be replaced with a one-page list of key questions consumers \nshould ask and is supplemented by a reference to a Federal Reserve website for additional information.\n\nWithin three days after receiving the consumer's application, creditors would provide disclosures specifically tailored \nto the actual credit terms for which the consumer qualifies. These disclosures would be in a format that consumers \nhave found easier to use.\n\nIn the current economic environment, many consumers have seen their home equity lines suspended or reduced. \nToday's proposal would also strengthen the consumer protections that apply in such cases. Creditors would have to \nprovide additional information to consumers so that consumers will understand the reasons for the action and their \nright to request reinstatement. The rules would also better define creditors' responsibilities in promptly investigating \nand responding to consumers who request reinstatement of their credit lines.\n\nI believe these additional consumer protections and enhanced disclosures better reflect consumers' need to \nunderstand today's complex mortgage products and represent a significant step forward in consumer protection.\n\nBefore turning to Sandy Braunstein, who is the Director of our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, I want \nto express my appreciation to her and her staff for their extraordinary effort and outstanding work over many \nmonths in developing these proposals.\n\nAttachment A\n\nFEDERAL RESERVE BOARD CONSUMER PROTECTION RESOURCES\n\nKey Questions to Ask About Home Equity Lines of Credit\n\nWhen you are shopping for a home equity line of credit, consider the questions below. Lines of credit can \nhave risky features that could make it difficult for you to repay your balance. As a result, you could lose your home. \nAsk your lender about other loan products, such as a traditional home equity loan. For more information, go to: \nwww.frb.gov.\n\n1 Can my interest rate increase?\n\nLines of credit usually have a variable interest rate, which means that the rate can increase or decrease from time \nto time. A lender may offer you a lower initial interest rate for a short time. However, after this period ends the rate \nwill usually increase.\n\n2 Can my minimum payment increase?\n\n\n\nYes, your minimum payment can increase based on several factors, such as when your variable interest rate \nincreases or you borrow more money.\n\n3 When can I borrow money?\n\nYou can borrow money only for a specified time, starting when you open your account. During this time, known as \nthe \"borrowing period,\" you can borrow money and you must make minimum payments. When the borrowing period \nends, you will no longer be able to borrow money from your line of credit.\n\n4 How soon do I have to pay off my balance?\n\nAfter the borrowing period ends, under some plans you may be required to pay off your balance immediately in one \npayment. Under other plans you will have a certain amount of time to pay down your balance. During this time, \nknown as the \"repayment period,\" you will not be able to borrow additional amounts and will have to make larger \nminimum payments than during the borrowing period.\n\n5 Will I owe a balloon payment?\n\nUnder some plans, if you make only the minimum payments you will not pay off your entire balance by the end of \nthe term. At that point, you will have to pay the remaining balance as a single lump-sum, known as a \"balloon \npayment.\" If you cannot get another loan to repay this amount, or pay it off using your savings, you could lose your \nhome.\n\n6 Do I have to pay any fees?\n\nIn addition to an application fee, you may be required to pay four (4) types of fees for your line of credit: (i) fees to \nopen your account, such as loan origination or property appraisal fees; (ii) fees to maintain your account, such as \nan annual fee; (iii) fees to use your account, such as a cash advance fee; and (iv) penalty fees, such as late \npayment or over-the-credit limit fees.\n\n7 Should I get a home equity loan instead of a line of credit?\n\nWith a home equity loan, you can borrow a fixed amount of money at a fixed interest rate. This means that your \ninterest rate and minimum payment will stay the same over time. Consider a home equity loan if you plan to borrow \na fixed amount of money at one time and want to know the exact amount of your minimum payment. Consider a \nhome equity line of credit if you plan to borrow different amounts of money over time and can afford higher \npayments, even if the interest rate on your line of credit reaches its maximum.\n\nBOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\nDIVISION OF CONSUMER AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: July 17, 2009\n\n\n\nTO: Board of Governors\n\nFROM: Governor Duke\n\nCommittee on Consumer and Community Affairs\n\nSUBJECT: Proposed Amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending)\n\nThe attached item has been reviewed by members of the Consumer and Community Affairs Committee and is now \nready for Board consideration.\n\nBOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\nDIVISION OF CONSUMER AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: July 17, 2009\n\nTO: Board of Governors\n\nFROM: Division of Consumer and Community Affairs *\n\nSUBJECT: Proposed Amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending)\n\nACTION REQUESTED: Approval to publish proposed amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) for public \ncomment. For closed-endmortgage transactions, the amendments would revise the disclosure requirements and \naddress other issues such as loan originators' compensation. For open-endmortgage transactions, the \namendments would revise the disclosure requirements and address other issues such as account terminations, \nsuspensions and credit limit reductions, and reinstatement of accounts.\n\nSummary\n\nThe goal of the proposed amendments to Regulation Z is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures that creditors \nprovide to consumers at application and throughout the life of a mortgage. The proposed changes are the result of \nstaff's review of the provisions that apply to closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling \nand open-end credit transactions secured by a consumer's dwelling (also known as home-equity lines of credit, or \nHELOCs). Staff recommends changes to the timing, format, and content of disclosure requirements for both closed-\nend mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nClosed-End Mortgages\n\n* S. Braustein, L. Chanin, J. Michael, J. Gell, K. Ryan, J. Wood, K. Ayoub, J. Goodson, J. McWilliams, P. Mondor, L. Neill, N. \nPastor, M. Yap\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFor closed-end mortgages, staff recommends changes to the four main types of credit disclosures governed by \nRegulation Z: (1) disclosures at application; (2) disclosures within three days after application; (3) disclosures three \ndays before consummation; and (4) disclosures after consummation. In addition, staff recommends additional \nprotections related to limits on loan originator compensation.\n\nDisclosures at Application. The proposal contains new requirements and changes to the format and content of \ndisclosures given at application, to make them more meaningful and easier for consumers to use. The proposed \nchanges (which are discussed in detail on pages 18 to 21) include:\n\n. Providing a new one-page Board publication, entitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage,\" which \nwould explain the potentially risky features of a loan.\n\n. Providing a new one-page Board publication, entitled \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages,\" which would \nexplain the basic differences between such loans and would replace the lengthy Consumer Handbook on \nAdjustable-Rate Mortgages (CHARM booklet) currently required.\n\n. Revising the format and content of the current adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loan program disclosure, \nincluding: a requirement that the disclosure be in a tabular question and answer format, a streamlined plain-\nlanguage disclosure of interest rate and payment information, and a new disclosure of potentially risky features, \nsuch as prepayment penalties.\n\nDisclosures within Three Days after Application. The proposal also contains revisions to the TILA disclosures \nprovided within three days after application to make the information clearer and more conspicuous. The proposed \nchanges (which are discussed in detail on pages 21 to 25) include:\n\n. Revising the calculation of the finance charge and annual percentage rate (APR) so that they better capture \nmost fees and costs paid by consumers in connection with the credit transaction.\n\n. Providing a graph that would show consumers how their APR compares to the APRs for borrowers with \nexcellent credit and for borrowers with impaired credit.\n\n. Requiring disclosure of potential changes to the interest rate and monthly payment.\n\n. Disclosing total settlement charges, as is currently required for the Good Faith Estimate (GFE) under the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and Regulation X.\n\n. Summarizing key loan features, including the loan term, amount, and type.\n\n. Adopting new format requirements, including rules regarding: type size and use of boldface for certain terms, \nplacement of information, and highlighting certain information in a tabular format.\n\nDisclosures Three Days before Consummation. The proposal would now require creditors to provide a \"final\" TILA \ndisclosure that the consumer must receive at least three business days before consummation. In addition, two \nproposed alternatives (which are discussed in detail on pages 25 to 28) include:\n\n. Alternative 1: If any terms change after the \"final\" TILA disclosures are provided, then another final TILA \ndisclosure would need to be provided that the consumer must receive at least three business days before \nconsummation.\n\n\n\n. Alternative 2: If the APR exceeds a certain tolerance or an adjustable-rate feature is added after the \"final\" \nTILA disclosures are provided, then another final TILA disclosure would be provided that the consumer must \nreceive at least three business days before consummation. All other changes could be disclosed at \nconsummation.\n\nDisclosures after Consummation. The proposal would change the timing, content and types of notices provided \nafter consummation. The proposed changes (which are discussed in detail on pages 28 to 30) include:\n\n. For ARMs, increasing advance notice of a payment change from 25 to 60 days, and revising the format and \ncontent of the ARM interest rate adjustment notice.\n\n. For loans with negative amortization, requiring a monthly statement to provide information about payment \noptions that include the costs and effects of negatively-amortizing payments.\n\n. For creditor-placed property insurance, requiring notice of the cost and coverage of such insurance at least 45 \ndays before imposing a charge for the insurance.\n\nLoan Originator Compensation. The proposal contains new limits on originator compensation. The proposed \nchanges (which are discussed in detail on pages 30 to 33) include:\n\n. Prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or a loan officer that are based on the loan's terms and \nconditions.\n\n. Prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from \"steering\" consumers to transactions that are not in their \ninterest in order to increase the mortgage broker's or loan officer's compensation.\n\nHome-Equity Lines of Credit\n\nFor HELOCs, staff recommends amendments related to the five main types of HELOC disclosures that would be \ngoverned by Regulation Z: (1) disclosures at application; (2) disclosures within three days after application; (3) \ndisclosures at account opening; (4) periodic statements; and (5) change-in-terms notices. Also, the proposal \nprovides additional guidance and protections, including certain changes to disclosure requirements, related to \naccount terminations, suspensions and credit limit reductions, and reinstatement of accounts.\n\nDisclosures at Application. The proposal contains several changes to the disclosures currently required at the time \nthat a consumer applies for a HELOC. The proposed changes (which are discussed in detail on pages 34 to 35) \ninclude:\n\n. Eliminating the requirement to provide a dense, multiple-page disclosure of generic rates and terms of the \ncreditor's HELOC products, as well as the requirement to provide a Board-published, lengthy brochure \nexplaining HELOC products and risks.\n\n. Requiring the creditor to provide at application a new one-page Board publication summarizing basic \ninformation and risks regarding HELOCs, entitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit.\"\n\nDisclosure within Three Days after Application. The proposal also replaces the disclosure of generic rates and \nterms with a new transaction-specific disclosure that must be given within three days after application. The \nproposed changes (which are discussed in detail on pages 35 to 37) include:\n\n. Providing information about rates and fees, payments, and risks in a tabular format.\n\n\n\n. Highlighting whether the consumer will be responsible for a balloon payment.\n\n. Presenting payment examples based on both the current rate available and the maximum possible rate for the \nHELOC.\n\nDisclosures at Account Opening. The proposal would retain the existing requirement to provide consumers with \ntransaction-specific information about rates, terms, payments, and risks at the time of account opening. To facilitate \ncomparison, the proposal would prescribe formatting for this information similar to that of the proposed disclosure \nprovided within three business days after application. The proposed changes are discussed in detail on pages 38 to \n40.\n\nPeriodic Statements. The proposal contains changes to the format and content of the periodic statement for \nHELOCs, largely conforming to the periodic statement provisions finalized in the December 2008 final rule for credit \ncards (December 2008 Open-End Final Rule). The proposed changes (which are discussed in detail on pages 40 to \n43) include:\n\n. Eliminating the disclosure of the effective annual percentage rate.\n\n. Grouping interest charges and fees separately and requiring disclosure of separate totals of interest and fees \nfor both the period and the year to date.\n\nChange-in-Terms Notices. The proposal contains changes to the format and content of the change-in-terms notice, \nlargely conforming to the change-in-terms provisions finalized in the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule. In \naddition, the proposal would increase advance notice of a change in a HELOC term from 15 to 45 days in advance \nof the effective date of the change. The proposed changes are discussed in detail on pages 44 to 46.\n\nAccount Terminations. The proposal would prohibit creditors from terminating an account for payment-related \nreasons until the consumer has failed to make a required minimum periodic payment for more than 30 days after \nthe due date for that payment. Staff is recommending that the Board request comment on whether a delinquency \nthreshold of more than 30 days or some other time period is appropriate. The proposed changes are discussed in \ndetail on page 47.\n\nSuspensions and Credit Limit Reductions. The proposal contains a number of additional protections related to \ntemporary suspensions of advances and credit limit reductions. The proposed changes (which are discussed in \ndetail on pages 47 to 50) include:\n\n. Establishing a new safe harbor for suspending or reducing a line of credit based on a \"significant\" decline in \nproperty value. For HELOCs with a combined loan-to-value ratio at origination of 90 percent or higher, a five \npercent decline in the property value would be \"significant.\"\n\n. Providing additional guidance regarding the information on which a creditor may rely to take action based on a \nmaterial change in the consumer's financial circumstances, such as the type of credit report information that \nwould be appropriate to consider.\n\nReinstatement of Accounts. The proposal contains additional requirements regarding reinstating accounts that have \nbeen temporarily suspended or reduced. The proposed changes (which are discussed in detail on page 50) include:\n\n. Requiring additional information in notices of suspension or reduction about consumers' ongoing right to \nrequest reinstatement and creditors' obligation to investigate this request\n\n. Requiring creditors to complete an investigation of a request within 30 days of receiving a request for \nreinstatement and to give a notice of the investigation results to consumers whose lines will not be reinstated.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Truth in Lending Act\n\nCongress enacted the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) based on findings that economic stability would be enhanced and \ncompetition among consumer credit providers would be strengthened by the informed use of credit resulting from \nconsumers' awareness of the cost of credit. One of the purposes of TILA is to provide a meaningful disclosure of \ncredit terms to enable consumers to compare credit terms available in the marketplace more readily and avoid the \nuninformed use of credit.\n\nTILA's disclosures differ depending on whether consumer credit is an open-end (revolving) plan or a closed-end \n(installment) loan. TILA is implemented by the Board's Regulation Z. An Official Staff Commentary interprets the \nrequirements of Regulation Z. By statute, creditors that follow in good faith Board or official staff interpretations are \ninsulated from civil liability, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions.\n\nThe Board's Rulemaking Authority\n\nTILA mandates that the Board prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of the act. TILA specifically \nauthorizes the Board, among other things, to do the following:\n\n. Issue regulations that contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, or that provide for such \nadjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, that in the Board's judgment are necessary or proper \nto effectuate the purposes of TILA, facilitate compliance with the act, or prevent circumvention or evasion.\n\n. Exempt from all or part of TILA any class of transactions if the Board determines that TILA coverage does not \nprovide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection. The Board must \nconsider factors identified in the act and publish its rationale at the time it proposes an exemption for comment.\n\n. Require additional disclosures for HELOC plans.\n\nIn addition, TILA authorizes the Board to prohibit acts or practices in connection with:\n\n. Mortgage loans that the Board finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of the Home \nOwnership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) of 1994; and\n\n. Refinancing of mortgage loans that the Board finds to be associated with abusive lending practices or that are \notherwise not in the interest of the borrower.\n\nThe Board's Review of Regulation Z\n\nThe Board has amended Regulation Z numerous times since TILA simplification in 1980. In 1987, the Board revised \nRegulation Z to require special disclosures for closed-end adjustable-rate mortgages secured by the borrower's \nprincipal dwelling. In 1989, the Board revised Regulation Z to implement the Home Equity Loan Consumer \nProtection Act of 1988. The 1989 revisions required creditors to disclose extensive information about HELOCs to \nconsumers, and imposed substantive limitations on HELOC creditors -- principally, by prohibiting changes in terms \nexcept under very limited circumstances. In 1995, the Board revised Regulation Z to implement HOEPA's changes \nto TILA. HOEPA requires special disclosures and substantive protections for home-equity loans and refinancing \nwith APRs or points and fees above certain statutory thresholds. Numerous other amendments have been made \nover the years to address new mortgage products and other matters, such as abusive lending practices in the \nmortgage and home equity markets.\n\n\n\nThe Board's current review of Regulation Z was initiated in December 2004 with an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking. 1 At that time, the Board announced its intent to conduct its review of Regulation Z in stages, focusing \nfirst on the rules for open-end (revolving) credit accounts that are not home-secured, chiefly general-purpose credit \ncards and retailer credit card plans. In December 2008, the Board approved final rules for open-end credit that is \nnot home-secured.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the Board proposed revisions to the rules for closed-end credit in several phases.\n\n. HOEPA. In 2007, the Board proposed rules under HOEPA for high-cost mortgage loans (2007 HOEPA \nProposed Rule). The final rules, approved in July 2008 (2008 HOEPA Final Rule), prohibited certain unfair or \ndeceptive lending and servicing practices in connection with closed-end mortgages. The Board also approved \nrevisions to advertising rules for both closed-end and open-end home-secured loans to ensure that \nadvertisements contain accurate and balanced information and do not contain misleading or deceptive \nrepresentations. The final rules also required creditors to provide consumers with transaction-specific \ndisclosures early enough to use while shopping for a mortgage.\n\n. Timing of Disclosures for Closed-End Mortgages. On May 7, 2009, the Board approved final rules \nimplementing the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008 (the MDIA). The MDIA adds to the \nrequirements of the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule regarding transaction-specific disclosures. Among other things, \nthe MDIA and the final rules require early, transaction-specific disclosures for mortgage loans secured by \ndwellings even when the dwelling is not the consumer's principal dwelling, and require waiting periods between \nthe time when disclosures are given and consummation of the transaction.\n\nThis proposal would revise the rules for disclosures for closed-end credit secured by real property or a consumer's \ndwelling and open-end credit secured by a consumer's dwelling. Staff anticipates reviewing the rules for rescission \nand reverse mortgages in a subsequent phase of the Regulation Z review.\n\nCoordination with Disclosures Required under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act\n\nStaff recommends that the Board work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to ensure \nthat TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) disclosures are compatible and \ncomplementary, including potentially developing a single disclosure form that creditors could use to combine the \ninitial disclosures required under TILA and RESPA. The two statutes have different purposes but have considerable \noverlap. Harmonizing the two disclosure schemes would ensure that consumers receive consistent information \nunder both laws. It may also help reduce information overload by eliminating some duplicative disclosures. \nConsumer testing would be used to ensure that consumers could understand and use the combined disclosures. In \nthe meantime, however, staff recommends that the Board include a revised model TILA form in its proposal, so that \ncommenters can see how the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z might be applied in practice.\n\nRESPA, which is implemented by HUD's Regulation X, seeks to ensure that consumers are provided with timely \ninformation about the nature and costs of the settlement process and are protected from unnecessarily high real \nestate settlement charges. To this end, RESPA mandates that consumers receive information about the costs \n\n1 The review was initiated pursuant to requirements of section 303 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory \nImprovement Act of 1994, section 610(c) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, and section 2222 of the Economic Growth and \nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. An advancenotice of proposed rulemaking is published to obtain preliminary \ninformation prior to issuing a proposed rule or, in some cases, deciding whether to issue a proposed rule.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nassociated with a mortgage loan transaction, and prohibits certain business practices. Under RESPA, creditors \nmust provide a good faith estimate (GFE) of settlement costs within three business days after a consumer submits \na written application for a mortgage loan, which is the same time creditors must provide the early TILA disclosure. \nRESPA also requires a statement of the actual costs imposed at loan settlement (HUD-1 settlement statement). In \nNovember 2008, HUD published revised RESPA rules, including new GFE and HUD-1 settlement statement forms, \nwhich lenders, mortgage brokers, and settlement agents must use beginning on January 1, 2010. In addition to \nrevised disclosures of settlement costs, the revised GFE now includes loan terms, some of which would also \nappear on a TILA disclosure, such as whether there is a prepayment penalty and the borrower's interest rate and \nmonthly payment. The revised GFE form was developed through HUD's consumer testing.\n\nTILA, which is implemented by the Board's Regulation Z, governs the disclosure of the APR and certain loan terms. \nThis proposal contains a revised model TILA form that was developed through consumer testing. In addition to a \nrevised disclosure of the APR and loan terms, the revised TILA disclosure would include the total settlement \ncharges that appear on the GFE required under RESPA. Total settlement charges would be added to the TILA form \nbecause consumer testing conducted by the Board found consumers wanted to have settlement charges disclosed \non the TILA form.\n\nStaff believes the proposed revised TILA form and HUD's revised GFE represent significant improvements, but \noverlap between the two forms could be eliminated to reduce information overload and consistency issues. There \nhave been previous efforts to develop a combined TILA and RESPA disclosure form, which were fueled by the \namount, complexity, and overlap of information in the disclosures. Under a 1996 congressional directive, the Board \nand HUD studied ways to simplify and improve the disclosures. In July 1998, the Board and HUD submitted a joint \nreport to Congress that sketched a broad outline intended to be a starting point for consideration of legislative \nreform of the mortgage disclosure requirements (1998 Joint Report). 2 The 1998 Joint Report included a \nrecommendation for combining and simplifying the RESPA and TILA disclosure forms to satisfy the requirements of \nboth laws. In addition, the 1998 Joint Report recommended that the timing of the TILA and RESPA disclosures be \ncoordinated. Recent regulatory changes addressed the timing issues so that the initial disclosures required under \nTILA and RESPA would be delivered at the same time.\n\nConsumer Testing\n\nA principal goal for the Regulation Z review is to produce revised and improved mortgage disclosures that \nconsumers will be more likely to understand and use in their decisions, while at the same time not creating undue \nburdens for creditors. For closed-end mortgages, Regulation Z currently requires creditors to provide at application \na generic ARM loan program disclosure and the CHARM booklet. A transaction-specific TILA disclosure is required \nwithin three business days of application and at least seven business days before consummation. For FIELOCs, \ncreditors must provide generic disclosures regarding various terms and features of the creditor's HELOC plans at \napplication, along with a lengthy, Board-published brochure explaining HELOC products. The creditor does not \nhave to provide a transaction-specific disclosure for HELOCs (i.e., including terms such as the consumer's APR \nand credit line limit) until the consumer opens the account.\n\nIn 2007, the Board retained a research and consulting firm (ICF Macro) that specializes in designing and testing \ndocuments to conduct consumer testing to help the Board's review of Regulation Z. Working closely with staff, ICF \nMacro conducted several tests in different cities throughout the United States. The closed-end testing consisted of \nfour focus groups and twelve rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews. The HELOC testing consisted of five \nrounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews. The goals of these focus groups and interviews were to learn more \n\n2 Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. and U.S. Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev.,Joint Report to the Congress Concerning \nReform to the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (1998), available \nathttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/tila.pdf. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/tila.pdf\n\n\nabout how consumers shop for mortgages and HELOCs, what information consumers read when they receive \nmortgage and HELOC disclosures, and assess their understanding of such disclosures.\n\nThe consumer testing groups contained participants with a range of ethnicities, ages, educational levels, and \nmortgage behaviors, including first-time closed-end mortgage and HELOC shoppers, prime and subprime \nborrowers, and consumers who had obtained one or more closed-end mortgages or HELOCs. For each round of \ntesting, ICF Macro developed a set of model disclosure forms to be tested. Interview participants were asked to \nreview model forms and provide their reactions, and were then asked a series of questions designed to test their \nunderstanding of the content. Data were collected on which elements and features of each form were most \nsuccessful in providing information clearly and effectively. The findings from each round of interviews were \nincorporated in revisions to the model forms for the following round of testing.\n\nDevelopment and testing of Regulation Z disclosures. Staff worked with ICF Macro to develop and test several \ntypes of disclosures, including:\n\nFor closed-end mortgages:\n\n. Two Board publications to be provided at application, entitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage\" \nand \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\";\n\n. An ARM loan program disclosure to be provided at application;\n\n. A transaction-specific TILA disclosure that must be provided within three business days of application and at \nleast seven business days before consummation, and that the consumer must receive again within three \nbusiness days of consummation;\n\n. An ARM interest rate adjustment notice to be provided after consummation; and\n\n. A payment option monthly statement to be provided after consummation.\n\nFor HELOCs:\n\n. A Board publication to be provided at application, entitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of \nCredit\";\n\n. A transaction-specific TILA disclosure to be provided within three business days of application, but no later \nthan at account-opening; and\n\n. A transaction-specific TILA disclosure to be provided at the time the consumer opens the account.\n\nStaff revised two additional HELOC disclosures to be provided after account opening: a periodic statement and a \nchange-in-terms notice that must be provided as applicable. Staff intends to test these two disclosures during the \ncomment period. In addition, staff developed model clauses for proposed notices required in connection with \nterminating, suspending or reducing accounts, and reinstating accounts, and may test these clauses during the \ncomment period.\n\nSome of the key findings of the consumer testing are summarized below, and in the Federal Register notices \ncontaining the proposals for closed-end mortgages and HELOCs. ICF Macro will also issue two reports \n\n\n\nsummarizing the results of the testing for closed-end mortgages and HELOCs, respectively, and these reports will \nbe available on the Board's public Web site along with the Regulation Z proposal.\n\nResults of closed-end testing. Consumer testing showed that consumers seldom contact more than one loan \noriginator when looking for a mortgage loan. For consumers who do shop for a mortgage, most end their shopping \nprocess at the time of application. Therefore, the proposal requires creditors to provide key information about \nevaluating loan terms at the time an application form is provided.\n\nConsumer testing also indicated that consumers were most likely to select a loan based on interest rate, monthly \npayment, loan type (such as fixed-rate or adjustable-rate), and settlement costs. Thus, under the proposal, the \nrevised TILA disclosure would prominently display these features in a tabular format. In addition, the APR would be \ndisclosed in large font and explained in the context of the APR for prime and higher-priced loans. Setting apart the \nmost important terms in this way will better ensure that consumers are apprised of these terms.\n\nMany consumers indicated that they learned at loan closing that their loan terms had changed or their settlement \ncharges had increased. Thus, the proposal would require creditors to provide a final TILA disclosure that the \nconsumer must receive at least three business days before consummation.\n\nConsumer comprehension of the costs and effects of potential rate and payment increases and negatively-\namortizing payment options significantly increased when consumers reviewed model forms developed by the Board \nand ICF Macro. Thus, the proposal would require creditors to provide a revised ARM interest rate adjustment \nnotice, and a payment option monthly statement in a format substantially similar to the model forms.\n\nResults of HELOC testing. Consumer testing showed that consumers seldom contact more than one loan \noriginator when looking for a HELOC and generally go to their current mortgage provider, a prior lender, or a bank \nwith which they have an existing banking relationship. Currently, Regulation Z requires that consumers receive \ngeneric HELOC program disclosures and a HELOC brochure at application, but does not require that consumers \nreceive any other disclosures until account opening. Consumer testing indicated that consumers had difficulty \nunderstanding and using the information in these dense, lengthy disclosures.\n\nThe proposal therefore would require creditors to provide at application a Board publication entitled, \"Key Questions \nto Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit,\" which would replace the HELOC brochure with a concise summary of \nHELOC product characteristics and risks. The proposal also would change the current timing, content, and format \nof generic HELOC plan disclosures currently required at application. Specifically, the proposal would require \ncreditors to provide a transaction-specific TILA disclosure within three business days of application, but no later \nthan at account opening. To facilitate comparison, a similarly-formatted disclosure would be required to be provided \nat account opening.\n\nConsumer testing also indicated that most consumers do not fully comprehend how HELOCs work, especially the \ndraw and repayment periods. Thus, under the proposal, the revised TILA disclosure would explain more \ncomplicated terms in plain language and present them in a tabular format.\n\nConsumer comprehension of the costs and effects of various terms significantly increased when consumers \nreviewed model forms developed by the Board and ICF Macro. Thus, the proposal would require creditors to \nprovide a revised periodic statement and change-in-terms notice incorporating formatting -- such as the \npresentation of key information in a table - found effective with other HELOC model disclosures tested, as well as \nperiodic statements and change-in-terms notices tested for the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule.\n\nAdditional testing during and after the comment period. During the comment period, staff will work with ICF Macro \nto conduct additional testing of model disclosures. After receiving comments from the public on the proposal and \nthe proposed disclosure forms, staff will work with ICF Macro to further revise model disclosures based on \ncomments received, and to conduct additional rounds of cognitive interviews to test the revised disclosures. After \nthe cognitive interviews, quantitative testing will be conducted. The goal of the quantitative testing is to measure \n\n\n\nconsumers' comprehension of the newly-developed disclosures relative to existing disclosures with a larger and \nmore statistically representative group of consumers.\n\nOther Outreach and Research Efforts\n\nStaff also solicited input from members of the Board's Consumer Advisory Council on various issues presented by \nthe review of Regulation Z. During 2009, for example, the Council discussed ways to improve disclosures for home-\nsecured credit. In addition, staff met or conducted conference calls with various industry and consumer group \nrepresentatives throughout the review process leading to this proposal. Staff also reviewed disclosures currently \nprovided by creditors, the Federal Trade Commission's report on consumer testing of mortgage disclosures, 3 \nHUD's report on consumer testing of the GFE, 4 and other information. In addition, staff reviewed research on home \nequity lending, and surveys on HELOC usage and trends. 5\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe goal of the proposed revisions is to improve the effectiveness of the Regulation Z disclosures that must be \nprovided to consumers for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling and open-end \ncredit transactions secured by a consumer's dwelling. To shop for and understand the cost, of credit, consumers \nmust be able to identify and understand the key terms of the mortgage. But the terms and conditions for mortgage \ntransactions can be very complex. The proposed revisions to Regulation Z are intended to provide the most \nessential information to consumers when the information would be most useful to them, with content and formats \nthat are clear and conspicuous. The proposed revisions are expected to improve consumers' ability to make \ninformed credit decisions and enhance competition among mortgage loan originators. Many of the changes are \nbased on the consumer testing that was conducted in connection with the review of Regulation Z.\n\nEn considering the proposed revisions, staff sought to ensure that the proposal would not reduce access to credit, \nand sought to balance the potential benefits for consumers with the compliance burdens imposed on creditors. For \nexample, the proposed revisions seek to provide greater certainty to creditors in identifying what costs must be \ndisclosed for mortgages, and how those costs must be disclosed. More effective disclosures may also reduce \nconfusion and misunderstanding, which may also ease creditors' costs relating to consumer complaints and \ninquiries.\n\nI.

Disclosures at Application\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires pre-application disclosures only for adjustable-rate transactions. For these \ntransactions, creditors are required to provide the CHARM booklet and a disclosure of twelve items of information at \nthe time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe proposal contains a number of revisions to the format and content of disclosures provided at application, to \nmake the disclosures more meaningful and easier to understand. To address concerns about other risky features in \naddition to adjustable rates, creditors would be required to provide a new one-page Board publication, entitled \"Key \nQuestions to Ask about Your Mortgage.\" In addition, creditors would be required to provide a one-page Board \npublication, entitled \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages,\" to explain the basic differences between fixed-rate and \nadjustable-rate mortgages. These publications would be provided regardless of whether the consumer is seeking a \nfixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage. Finally, for consumers who express interest in an ARM, creditors would be \nrequired to provide a revised ARM loan program disclosure that focuses on interest rate and payment features and \nkey questions about risks.\n\n\"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage\" publication. Currently, Regulation Z requires pre-application \ndisclosures only for adjustable-rate transactions. Over time, consumers have been provided with more loan choices \nin addition to adjustable-rate features, but also more potential risks. The proposal would require creditors to provide \nto consumers a one-page Board publication, entitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage.\" Creditors would \nbe required to provide this publication for all closed-end mortgages, not just adjustable-rate mortgages, before the \nconsumer applies for a loan or pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. The publication would inform \nconsumers about the following risky features: interest rate increases, monthly payment increases, interest-only \nfeatures, negative amortization features, prepayment penalties, balloon payments, and no-documentation or low-\ndocumentation loans. To enable consumers to track the presence or absence of potentially risky features \nthroughout the mortgage process, these key questions and answers would also be included in the ARM loan \nprogram disclosure and in the transaction-specific TILA disclosure.\n\n\"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\" publication. Currently, creditors must provide the CHARM booklet at the time \nan application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. Consumer \ntesting indicated, however, that consumers find the CHARM booklet too lengthy to be useful. Thus, instead of the \nCHARM booklet, the proposal would require creditors to provide a one-page Board publication, entitled \"Fixed vs. \nAdjustable Rate Mortgages.\" The publication would contain a plain-language explanation of the basic differences \nbetween fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nARM loan program disclosure. Currently, for each adjustable-rate loan program in which a consumer expresses an \ninterest, creditors must provide a disclosure of twelve items of information, including the index and margin to be \nused to calculate interest rates and payments, and either a 15-year historical example of rates and payments for a $ \n10,000 loan, or the maximum interest rate and payment for a $ 10,000 loan originated at the interest rate in effect \nfor the disclosure's identified month and year. Consumer testing indicated that consumers overwhelmingly find the \ncurrent ARM loan program disclosure unclear and not useful. Consumer testing also showed that consumers do \nnot understand the historical example; they would prefer more information specific to their potential loan. Thus, the \nproposal would simplify the ARM loan program disclosure to focus on the interest rate and payment and the key \nquestions about risk for the particular loan program. The disclosure would be provided in a tabular question and \nanswer format to enable consumers to easily locate the most important information.\n\nB. Disclosures within Three Days after Application\n\nTILA and Regulation Z currently require creditors to provide an early TILA disclosure within three business days \nafter application and at least seven business days before consummation, and before the consumer has paid a fee \n\n\n\nother than a fee for obtaining a credit history. 6 If subsequent events make the early TILA disclosure inaccurate, the \ncreditor must provide corrected disclosures before consummation. However, if subsequent events cause the APR \nto exceed certain tolerances, the creditor must provide a corrected disclosure that the consumer must receive at \nleast three business days before consummation.\n\nThe early TILA disclosure and any corrected disclosure (collectively, the \"TILA disclosure\") must include certain \nloan information, including the amount financed, the finance charge, the APR, the total of payments, and the \namount and timing of payments. The finance charge is the sum of all credit-related charges, but excludes a variety \nof fees and charges. TILA requires that the finance charge and the APR be disclosed more conspicuously than \nother information. The APR is calculated based on the finance charge and is meant to be a single, unified number \nto help consumers understand the total cost of credit.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe proposal contains a number of revisions to the format and content of TILA disclosures to make them clearer \nand more conspicuous. Special formatting requirements, consistent terminology, and a minimum 10-point font \nwould ensure that consumers are able to identify and review key loan terms. To better represent the cost of credit, \nthe proposal would eliminate exclusions from the finance charge and require a simpler, more inclusive approach. \nThe finance charge would no longer be disclosed more conspicuously than other credit terms, but the disclosure of \nthe APR would be enhanced to improve consumers comprehension of the cost of credit. To further assist \nconsumers in determining whether the proposed loan is affordable for them, creditors would be required to disclose \nthe interest rate together with the corresponding monthly payment, the loan amount, settlement costs, and the key \nquestions about risk.\n\nCalculation of the finance charge. The proposal contains a number of revisions to the calculation of the finance \ncharge and the disclosure of the finance charge and the APR to improve consumers' understanding of the cost of \ncredit. Under TILA, the \"finance charge\" is the sum of all charges payable by the consumer that are imposed by the \ncreditor in connection with the credit transaction, but does not include any charges that would be payable in a \ncomparable cash transaction. The finance charge is meant to represent the cost of credit expressed as a dollar \namount, and is also used to calculate the APR, which is meant to represent the cost of credit expressed as a yearly \npercentage rate. Currently, TILA and Regulation Z permit creditors to exclude several fees or charges from the \nfinance charge, including certain fees or charges imposed by third party closing agents; certain premiums for credit \nor property insurance or fees for debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage, if the creditor meets certain \nconditions; security interest charges; and real-estate related fees, such as title examination or document \npreparation fees.\n\nConsumer groups, creditors, and government agencies have long been dissatisfied with the some fees in, some \nfees out\" approach to the finance charge. Consumer groups and others believe that the current approach obscures \nthe true cost of credit. They contend that this approach creates incentives for creditors to shift the cost of credit from \nthe interest rate to ancillary fees excluded from the finance charge. They further contend that this approach \nundermines the purpose of the APR, which is to express in a single figure the total cost of credit. Creditors maintain \nthat consumers are confused by the APR, and, thus, believe that the current approach creates significant regulatory \nburdens. They contend that determining which fees are or are not included in the finance charge is overly complex \nand creates litigation risk.\n\n6 To ease discussion, the description of theclosed-end mortgage disclosure scheme includes the MDIA's recent amendments to \nTILA and the requirements of the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule that will be effective July 30, 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFor these reasons, staff recommends the Board use its exception and exemption authority to override exclusions to \nthe finance charge for closed-end mortgages, including HOEPA loans. 7 The proposal would maintain TILA's \ndefinition of a finance charge as a fee or charge that is payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed \ndirectly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. However, the proposal would now \nrequire the finance charge to include charges by third parties if the creditor requires the use of a third party as a \ncondition of or incident to the extension of credit (even if the consumer chooses the third party), or if the creditor \nretains a portion of the third-party charge (to the extent of the portion retained). Charges that would be incurred in a \ncomparable cash transaction, such as transfer taxes, would continue to be excluded from the finance charge. Under \nthis approach, consumers would benefit from having a finance charge and APR disclosure that better represent the \ncost of credit, undiluted by myriad exclusions for various fees and charges. This approach would cause more loans \nto be subject to the special protections of the Board's 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, special disclosures and restrictions \nfor HOEPA loans, and certain state anti-predatory lending laws. However, the proposal would also reduce \ncompliance burdens, regulatory uncertainty, and litigation risks for creditors.\n\nDisclosure of the finance charge and the APR. Currently, creditors are required to disclose the loan's \"finance \ncharge\" and \"annual percentage rate,\" using those terms, more conspicuously than the other required disclosures. \nConsumer testing indicated that consumers do not understand the term \"finance charge.\" Most consumers believe \nthe term refers to the total of all interest they would pay if they keep the loan to maturity, but do not realize that it \nincludes the fees and costs associated with the loan. For these reasons, the proposal replaces the term \"finance \ncharge\" with \"interest and settlement charges\" to make clear it is more than interest, and the disclosure would no \nlonger be more conspicuous than the other required disclosures.\n\nIn addition, the disclosure of the APR would be enhanced to improve consumer comprehension of the cost of credit. \nUnder the proposal, creditors would be required to disclose the APR in 16-point font in close proximity to a graph \nthat compares the consumer's APR to the HOEPA average prime offer rate for borrowers with excellent credit and \nthe HOEPA threshold for higher-priced loans. 8 This disclosure would put the APR in context and help consumers \nunderstand whether they are being offered a loan that comports with their creditworthiness.\n\nInterest rate and payment summary. Currently, creditors are required to disclose the number, amount, and timing of \npayments scheduled to repay the loan. Under the MDIA's amendments to TILA, creditors will be required to provide \nexamples of adjustments to the regular required payment based on the change in interest rates specified in the \ncontract. Consumer testing consistently indicated that consumers shop for and evaluate a mortgage based on the \ncontract interest rate and the monthly payment, but consumers have difficulty understanding such terms using the \ncurrent TILA disclosure. Under the proposal, creditors would be required to disclose in a tabular format the contract \ninterest rate together with the corresponding monthly payment, including escrows for taxes and property and/or \nmortgage insurance. Special disclosure requirements would be imposed for adjustable-rate or step-rate loans to \n\n7 HOEPA loans areclosed-end, non-purchase money mortgages secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, that have APRs \nor points and fees that exceed certain statutory triggers.\n\n \n\n \n\n8 The \"average prime offer rate\" is a survey-based estimate of rates currently offered on low-risk primemortgages. A \"higher-\npriced loan\" is a first-lien mortgage with an APR that is 1.5 percentage points or more above the average prime offer rate, or a \nsubordinate-lien loan that is 3.5 percentage points or more above the average prime offer rate.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nshow the interest rate and payment at consummation, the maximum interest rate and payment at first adjustment, \nand the highest possible maximum interest rate and payment. Additional special disclosures would be required for \nloans with negatively-amortizing payment options, introductory interest rates, interest-only payments, and balloon \npayments.\n\nDisclosure of other terms. In addition to the interest rate and monthly payment, consumer testing indicated that \nconsumers benefit from the disclosure of other key terms in a clear format. Thus, the proposal would require \ncreditors to provide in a tabular format information about the loan amount, the loan term, the loan type (such as \nfixed-rate), the total settlement charges, and the maximum amount of any prepayment penalty. In addition, creditors \nwould be required to disclose in a tabular question and answer format the \"Key Questions about Risk,\" which would \ninclude a disclosure of information about interest rate increases, payment increases, and prepayment penalties, \nand, as applicable, interest-only payments, negative amortization, balloon payments, demand features, no-\ndocumentation or low-documentation loans, or shared-equity or shared-appreciation features.\n\nC. Disclosures Three Days before Consummation\n\nUnder the MDIA's amendments to TILA, the creditor will be required to provide the TILA disclosure to the consumer \nwithin three days after receiving the consumer's written application and at least seven business days before \nconsummation, and before the consumer has paid a fee other than a fee for obtaining a credit history (early TILA \ndisclosure). If the APR on the early TILA disclosure exceeds a certain tolerance before consummation, the creditor \nmust provide a corrected disclosure that the consumer must receive at least three days before consummation. If \nany term other than the APR becomes inaccurate, the creditor must give the corrected disclosure no later than at \nconsummation.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe proposal offers for comment two alternative approaches to address concerns about consumers facing \nsettlement costs or loan terms at closing that differ from those that were disclosed in the early TILA disclosure. Both \nproposals would require the creditor to provide a final TILA disclosure that the consumer must receive at least three \nbusiness days before consummation, even if subsequent events do not make the early TILA disclosure inaccurate. \nUnder the first approach, if any terms change during this three-business-day waiting period, the creditor would be \nrequired to provide another final TILA disclosure and three-business-day waiting period. Under the second \napproach, the creditor would be required to provide another final TILA disclosure and three-business-day waiting \nperiod only if the APR exceeds a certain tolerance or the creditor adds an adjustable-rate feature.\n\nTiming of disclosure. Currently, creditors are required to provide the early TILA disclosure within three days of \nreceiving the consumer's written application or before consummation, whichever is earlier. If any term of the TILA \ndisclosure becomes inaccurate, the creditor must provide a corrected disclosure before consummation, which is, in \neffect, at closing. Under the MDIA's amendments to TILA, effective July 30, 2009, the creditor will be required to \nprovide the early TILA disclosure to the consumer within three days after receiving the consumer's written \napplication and at least seven business days before consummation, and before the consumer has paid a fee other \nthan a fee for obtaining a credit history. If the APR on the early TILA disclosure exceeds a certain tolerance before \nconsummation, the creditor must provide a corrected disclosure that the consumer must receive at least three days \nbefore consummation. If any term other than the APR becomes inaccurate, the creditor must give the corrected \ndisclosure no later than at consummation. The consumer may waive the seven- and three-day waiting periods for a \nbona fide personal financial emergency.\n\nThere are, however, long-standing concerns about consumers facing different loan terms or increased settlement \ncosts at closing. Members of the Board's Consumer Advisory Council, participants in public hearings, and \ncommenters on prior Board rulemakings have expressed concern about consumers not learning of changes to \ncredit terms or settlement charges until consummation. In addition, consumer testing indicated that consumers are \noften surprised at closing by changes in important loan terms, such as the addition of an adjustable-rate feature. \nDespite these changes, consumers report that they have proceeded with closing because they lacked alternatives \n\n\n\n(especially in the case of a home purchase loan), or were told that they could easily refinance with better terms in \nthe near future.\n\nFor these reasons, the proposal would require the creditor to provide a \"final\" TILA disclosure that the consumer \nmust receive at least three business days before consummation, even if nothing has changed since the early TILA \ndisclosure was provided. In addition, staff recommends two alternative approaches to address changes to loan \nterms and settlement charges during the three-business-day waiting period. Under the first approach, if any terms \nchange during the three-business-day waiting period, the creditor would be required to provide another final TILA \ndisclosure and wait an additional three-business-days before consummation could occur. This proposal would \nenable consumers to know their loan terms and total settlement charges with certainty three days before \nconsummation and have a meaningful opportunity to make an informed credit decision. If the terms or costs did not \nmatch the previous TILA disclosures, the consumer could contact the creditor and seek clarification or take other \naction. This proposal would delay closing, which would inconvenience some consumers for potentially minor \nchanges. It appears, however, that the cost would be outweighed by the benefit to consumers of knowing the final \ncost of credit in advance of consummation.\n\nStaff also recommends seeking comments on an alternative proposal. Under the second approach, creditors would \nbe required to provide another final TILA disclosure, but would have to wait an additional three-business-days \nbefore consummation only if the APR exceeds tolerance or the creditor adds an adjustable-rate feature. Otherwise, \nthe creditor would be permitted to provide another final TILA disclosure at consummation. This proposal would \navoid inconveniencing consumers and increasing costs unless changes were made to key terms of the loan.\n\nD. Disclosures after Consummation\n\nRegulation Z requires certain notices to be provided after consummation. Currently, for adjustable-rate transactions, \ncreditors are required to provide a notice of an interest rate adjustment at least 25, but no more than 120, calendar \ndays before a payment at a new level is due. There are no disclosure requirements for other post-consummation \nevents.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe proposal seeks to address concerns that consumers may not have enough time to evaluate the effects and \ncosts of post-consummation events that impact their payments. Thus, under the proposal, creditors would be \nrequired to provide the ARM interest rate adjustment notice in a revised format at least 60 days before payment at a \nnew level is due. To address concerns about the impact of negatively-amortizing payments, creditors would be \nrequired to provide a statement not later than 15 days before a periodic payment is due for a negatively-amortizing \npayment option loan. Finally, to address concerns about the cost of creditor-placed property insurance, creditors \nwould be required to provide notice of the cost and coverage of such insurance at least 45 days before a charge is \nimposed for the insurance.\n\nARM interest rate adjustment notice. Currently, for adjustable-rate transactions, creditors are required to provide a \nnotice of interest rate adjustment at least 25, but no more than 120, calendar days before a payment at a new level \nis due. In addition, creditors must provide an adjustment notice at least once each year during which an interest rate \nadjustment is implemented without an accompanying payment change. These disclosures must include certain \ninformation, including the current and prior interest rates and the index values upon which the current and prior \ninterest rates are based.\n\nStaff recommends that creditors be required to provide the ARM interest rate adjustment notice at least 60 days \nbefore payment at a new level is due. This proposal seeks to address concerns that consumers need more than 25 \ndays to seek out a refinancing in the event of a payment adjustment. This notice is particularly critical for subprime \nborrowers who may be more vulnerable to payment shock and may have a more difficult time refinancing a loan. To \nimprove consumer comprehension, the proposal would require creditors to use a revised notice that would contain \na table with a comparison of current and new interest rate and payment information, along with the due date for the \nnew payment.\n\n\n\nPayment option statement. Currently, creditors are not required to provide disclosures after consummation for \nnegatively-amortizing loans, such as payment option loans. To ensure consumers receive information about the \nrisks associated with payment option loans, (e.g., payment shock), the proposal would require creditors to disclose \na periodic statement for negatively-amortizing loans. The disclosure would contain a table with a comparison of the \namount and impact on the loan balance and property equity of a fully-amortizing payment, an interest-only payment, \nand a minimum negatively-amortizing payment. This disclosure would be provided not later than 15 days before a \nperiodic payment is due.\n\nCreditor-placed property insurance notice. Creditors are not currently required under Regulation Z to provide notice \nbefore charging for creditor-placed property insurance. Industry reports indicate that the volume of creditor-placed \nproperty insurance has increased significantly. Consumers struggling financially may fail to pay required property \ninsurance premiums unaware that creditors have the right to obtain such insurance on their behalf and add the \npremiums to their outstanding loan balance. Such premiums are often considerably more expensive than premiums \nfor insurance obtained by the consumer. Thus, under the proposal, creditors would be required to provide notice to \nconsumers of the cost and coverage of creditor-placed property insurance at least 45 days before a charge is \nimposed for such insurance. In addition, creditors would be required to provide consumers with evidence of such \ninsurance within 15 days of imposing a charge for the insurance.\n\nE. Prohibitions on Payments to Loan Originators and Steering\n\nCurrently, creditors pay commissions to loan originators in the form of \"yield spread premiums.\" A yield spread \npremium is the present dollar value of the difference between the lowest interest rate a wholesale lender would \nhave accepted on a particular transaction and the interest rate a mortgage broker actually obtained for the lender. \nSome or all of this dollar value is usually paid to the mortgage broker by the creditor as a form of compensation, \nthough it may also be applied to other closing costs.\n\nYield spread premiums can create financial incentives to steer consumers to riskier loans for which the loan \noriginators will receive greater compensation. Consumers generally are not aware of the loan originators' conflict of \ninterest and cannot reasonably protect themselves against it Yield spread premiums may provide some benefit to \nconsumers because consumers do not have to pay loan originators' compensation in cash or through financing. \nHowever, this benefit may be outweighed by costs to consumers, such as when consumers pay a higher interest \nrate or obtain a loan with terms the consumer may not have chosen otherwise, such as a prepayment penalty or an \nadjustable rate.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the 2007 HOEPA Proposed Rule attempted to address the potential unfairness \nthrough disclosure. The proposal would have prohibited a creditor from paying a mortgage broker more than the \nconsumer had previously agreed in writing that the mortgage broker would receive. A mortgage broker would have \nhad to enter into the written agreement with the consumer before accepting the consumer's loan application and \nbefore the consumer paid any fee in connection with the transaction (other than a fee for obtaining a credit report). \nThe broker also would have disclosed (1) that the consumer ultimately would bear the cost of the entire \ncompensation even if the creditor paid part of it directly; and (2) that a creditor's payment to a broker could influence \nthe broker to offer the consumer loan terms or products that would not be in the consumer's interest or the most \nfavorable the consumer could obtain.\n\nBased on analysis of comments received on the 2007 HOEPA Proposed Rule, the results of consumer testing, and \nother information, the Board withdrew the proposed provisions relating to broker compensation in the 2008 HOEPA \nFinal Rule. In particular, the Board's consumer testing raised concerns that the proposed agreement and \ndisclosures would confuse consumers and undermine their decision-making rather than improve it Consumers often \nconcluded, erroneously, that brokers are more expensive than creditors. Many also believed that brokers would \nserve their best interests notwithstanding the conflict resulting from the relationship between interest rates and \n\n\n\nbrokers' compensation. 9 The proposed disclosures presented a significant risk of misleading consumers regarding \nboth the relative costs of brokers and lenders and the role of brokers in their transactions. In withdrawing the broker \ncompensation provisions of the 2007 HOEPA Proposed Rule, the Board stated it would continue to explore \navailable options to address potential unfairness associated with loan originator compensation arrangements.\n\nTo address the concerns related to loan originator compensation, staff recommends the Board prohibit payments to \nmortgage brokers and to creditors' employees who originate loans (collectively, \"loan originators\") that are based on \nthe loan's terms and conditions. Staff also recommends the Board prohibit loan originators from \"steering\" \nconsumers to transactions that are not in consumers' interest in order to increase the loan originators' \ncompensation. These rules would be proposed under the Board's HOEPA authority to prohibit unfair or deceptive \nacts or practices in connection with mortgage loans.\n\nTo address the potential unfairness that can arise with loan originator compensation, the proposal would prohibit \nloan originators from receiving compensation based on the credit transaction's terms or conditions. This prohibition \nwould not apply to payments that consumers make directly to loan originators. Staff recommends the Board solicit \ncomment on an alternative that would allow loan originators to receive payments that are based on the principal \nloan amount, which is a common practice today. If a consumer directly pays the loan originator, the proposal would \nprohibit the loan originator from also receiving compensation from any other party in connection with that \ntransaction.\n\nUnder the proposal, a \"loan originator\" would include both mortgage brokers and employees of creditors who \nperform loan origination functions. The 2007 HOEPA Proposed Rule covered only mortgage brokers. However, a \ncreditor's loan officers frequently have the same discretion as mortgage brokers over loan pricing that enables them \nto modify the loan's terms to increase their compensation, and there is evidence that creditors' loan officers engage \nin such practices. For this reason, staff recommends the Board apply the prohibition to both mortgage brokers and \nloan officers.\n\nThe proposal would also prohibit loan originators from directing or \"steering\" consumers to a particular creditor's \nloan products based on the fact that the loan originator will receive additional compensation even when that loan \nmay not be in the consumer's best interest. Staff recommends the Board solicit comment on whether the proposed \nrule would be effective in achieving the stated purpose. In addition, staff recommends the Board solicit comment on \nthe feasibility and practicality of such a rule, its enforceability, and any unintended adverse effects the rule might \nhave.\n\nF. Additional Protections\n\nCredit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage eligibility for all loan transactions. Currently, \ncreditors may exclude from the finance charge a premium or charge for credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension coverage if the creditor discloses the voluntary nature and cost of the product, and the consumer signs \nor initials an affirmative request for the product. Concerns have been raised about creditors who sometimes offer \nproducts that contain eligibility restrictions, specifically age or employment restrictions, but do not evaluate whether \napplicants for the products actually meet the eligibility restrictions at the time of enrollment. Subsequently, \nconsumers' claims for benefits may be denied because they did not meet the eligibility restrictions at the time of \nenrollment. Consumers are presumably unaware that they are paying for a product for which they will derive no \n\n9 See Macro International, Inc., Consumer Testing of Mortgage Broker Disclosures (July 10, 2008), available \nathttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714regzconstest.pdf. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714regzconstest.pdf\n\n\nbenefit. Under the proposal, creditors would be required to determine whether the consumer meets the age and/or \nemployment eligibility criteria at the time of enrollment in the product and provide a disclosure that such a \ndetermination has been made. The proposal is not limited to mortgage transactions and would apply to all closed-\nend and open-end transactions.\n\nII. Home-Equity Lines of Credit\n\nA. Disclosures at Application\n\nTILA and Regulation Z require creditors to provide to the consumer two types of disclosures at the time of \napplication: a set of disclosures describing various features of a creditor's HELOC plans (the \"application \ndisclosures\") and a home-equity brochure published by the Board (the \"HELOC brochure\"), which provides \ninformation about how HELOCs work. Neither contains transaction-specific information about the terms of the \nHELOC, such as the consumer's credit limit or APR.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nStaff recommends that the Board use its adjustment and exception authority to make the changes described below. \nSpecifically, staff recommends replacing the application disclosures with transaction-specific HELOC disclosures \n(\"early HELOC disclosures\") that must be given within three business days after application (but no later than \naccount opening). In addition, staff recommends eliminating the requirement for creditors to provide to consumers \nthe HELOC brochure. Instead, the proposal would require a creditor to provide to consumers at application a new \none-page document published by the Board entitled, \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit\" \n(the \"Key Questions\" document).\n\n\"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit\" publication. Currently, a creditor is required to provide to \na consumer the HELOC brochure or a suitable substitute at the time an application for a HELOC is provided to the \nconsumer. The HELOC brochure is 20 pages long and provides general information about HELOCs and how they \nwork, as well as a glossary of relevant terms and a description of various features that can apply to HELOCs.\n\nThe proposal would eliminate the requirement for creditors to provide to consumers the HELOC brochure with \napplications. The Board's consumer testing on HELOC disclosures has shown that consumers are unlikely to read \nthe HELOC brochure because of its length. Instead, the proposal would require a creditor to provide the new \"Key \nQuestions\" document that would be published by the Board. This one-page document is intended to be a simple, \nstraightforward and concise disclosure informing consumers about HELOC terms and risks that are important to \nconsider when selecting a home-equity product, including potentially risky features such as adjustable rates and \nballoon payments. The \"Key Questions\" document was designed based on consumers' preference for a question-\nand-answer tabular format, and refined in several rounds of consumer testing.\n\nB. Disclosures within Three Days after Application\n\nRegulation Z currently requires the disclosures that must be provided on or with an application to contain \ninformation about the creditor's HELOC plans, including the length of the draw and repayment periods, how the \nminimum required payment is calculated, whether a balloon payment will be owed if a consumer only makes \nminimum required payments, payment examples, and what fees are charged by the creditor to open, use, or \nmaintain the plan. These disclosures do not include information dependent on a specific borrower's \ncreditworthiness or the value of the dwelling, such as a credit limit or the APRs offered to the consumer, because \nthe application disclosures are provided before underwriting takes place.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe Board's consumer testing on HELOC disclosures has shown that, because the current application disclosures \ndo not contain transaction-specific information applicable to the consumer, these disclosures may not provide \n\n\n\nmeaningful information to consumers to enable them to compare different HELOC products and to make informed \ndecisions about whether to open an HELOC plan. Thus, the proposal would replace the application disclosures with \ntransaction-specific \"early HELOC disclosures\" that must be given within three business days after application (but \nno later than account opening), and revise the format and content of the disclosures to make them more clear and \nconspicuous.\n\nContent of proposed early HELOC disclosures. The proposal would require creditors to include several additional \ndisclosures in the early HELOC disclosures not currently required to be disclosed as part of the application \ndisclosures, such as (1) the APRs and credit limit being offered; (2) a statement that the consumer has no \nobligation to accept the terms disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures; and (3) if the creditor has a provision for \nthe consumer's signature, a statement that a signature by the consumer only confirms receipt of the disclosure \nstatement. Based on consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board believes that \nthese new disclosures would provide meaningful information to consumers in deciding whether to open a HELOC \nplan.\n\nThe proposal would not require creditors to provide certain disclosures currently required to be disclosed as part of \nthe application disclosures. For example, currently TILA and Regulation Z require the creditor to disclose a 15-year \nhistorical payment example table, a statement that the APR does not include costs other than interest, and a \nstatement of the earliest time the maximum rate could be reached. Based on consumer testing, the Board believes \nthat these disclosures do not provide meaningful information to consumers in deciding whether to open a HELOC \nplan. However, other information that consumer testing demonstrated would be helpful to consumer would be \nrequired to be disclosed.\n\nMoreover, the proposal would revise certain information that TILA and Regulation Z currently require be disclosed \nin the application disclosures and included in the proposed early HELOC disclosures. For example, the application \ndisclosures currently must include several payment examples based on a $ 10,000 outstanding balance. Staff \nrecommends that the Board require payment examples in the early HELOC disclosures based on the full credit line. \nBased on consumer testing, staff believes that this revision to the payment examples, and other revisions to the \nexisting application disclosures, would effectively provide meaningful information to consumers in deciding whether \nto open a HELOC plan.\n\nFormat requirements for the proposed early HELOC disclosures. The proposal would impose stricter format \nrequirements for the proposed early HELOC disclosures than currently are required for the application disclosures. \nThe application disclosures may be provided in a narrative form; under the proposal, the early HELOC disclosures \nmust be provided in the form of a table with headings, content, and format developed through multiple rounds of \nconsumer testing. In consumer testing, participants found information in a tabular format easier to understand and \nhad more success answering comprehension questions than when these participants reviewed application \ndisclosures in a narrative form.\n\nC. Disclosures at Account Opening\n\nTILA and Regulation Z require creditors to disclose costs and terms at the time that a HELOC plan is opened. The \ndisclosures must specify the circumstances under which a \"finance charge\" may be imposed and how it will be \ndetermined, including charges such as interest, transaction charges, minimum charges, each periodic rate of \ninterest that may be applied to an outstanding balance (e.g., for purchases or cash advances) as well as the \ncorresponding APR. In addition, creditors must disclose the amount of any charge other than a finance charge, \nsuch as a late-payment charge. Currently, few format requirements apply to account-opening disclosures; typically \nthey are interspersed among other contractual terms in the creditor's account agreement.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nStaff recommends that the Board use its authority to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans and to make \nexceptions and adjustments to revise the account-opening disclosure requirements in two significant ways. First, \n\n\n\nthe proposal would require a tabular summary of key terms. Second, the proposal would reform how and when cost \ndisclosures must be made.\n\nAccount-opening summary table. The proposal seeks to make the cost disclosures provided at account opening \nmore conspicuous and easier to read. Accordingly, the proposal identifies specific costs and terms that creditors \nwould be required to summarize in a table. This account opening table would be substantially similar to the early \nHELOC disclosure table that would be provided within three business days after application, with two major \nexceptions. First, the account-opening table would show only the payment plan chosen by the consumer, rather \nthan a maximum of two plans required in the early HELOC disclosures. Second, the account-opening table would \ncontain transaction fees and penalty fees not required to be disclosed in the early HELOC disclosure table. Despite \nthese differences between the two tables, the Board believes that consumers could use the new table provided at \naccount opening to compare the terms of their accounts to the early HELOC disclosure table. Consumers would no \nlonger be required to search for the information in the credit agreement.\n\nHow charges are disclosed. Under the current rules, a creditor must disclose any \"finance charge\" or \"other charge\" \nin the written account-opening disclosures. In addition, the regulation identifies fees that are not considered to be \neither \"finance charges\" or \"other charges\" and, therefore, need not be included in the account-opening disclosures. \nThe distinctions among finance charges, other charges, and charges that do not fall into either category are not \nalways clear. Examples of included or excluded charges are in the regulation and commentary, but these examples \ncannot provide definitive guidance in all cases. This uncertainty can pose legal risks for creditors that act in good \nfaith to comply with the law. Creditors are subject to civil liability and administrative enforcement for under-\ndisclosing the finance charge or otherwise making erroneous disclosures, so the consequences of an error can be \nsignificant. Furthermore, over-disclosure of rates and finance charges is not permitted by Regulation Z for open-end \ncredit.\n\nThe fee disclosure rules also have been criticized as being outdated and impractical. These rules require creditors \nto provide fee disclosures at account opening, which may be months, and possibly years, before a particular \ndisclosure is relevant to the consumer, such as when the consumer calls the creditor to request a service for which \na fee is imposed. In addition, an account-related transaction may occur by telephone, when a written disclosure is \nnot feasible.\n\nThe proposed rule is intended to respond to these criticisms while still giving full effect to TILA's requirement to \ndisclose credit charges before they are imposed. Accordingly, under the proposal, the revised rules would (1) \nspecify precisely the charges that creditors must disclose in writing at account opening (e.g., interest, account-\nopening fees, transaction fees, annual fees, and penalty fees such as for paying late), which would be listed in the \nsummary table, and; (2) permit creditors to disclose certain optional charges orally or in writing before the consumer \nagrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge. These proposals reflect amendments finalized in the December \n2008 Open-End Final Rule for open-end (not home-secured) credit; however, they would not change current \nsubstantive restrictions on permissible changes in HELOC terms.\n\nD. Periodic Statements\n\nCurrently, TILA and Regulation Z require creditors to provide periodic statements reflecting the account activity for \nthe billing cycle (typically, one month). In addition to identifying each transaction on the account, TILA and \nRegulation Z require creditors to identify \"finance charges\" assessed against the account during the statement \nperiod. Regulation Z requires \"finance charges\" to be identified as such, as well as disclosure of each \"other \ncharge\" assessed against the account during the statement period. TILA and Regulation Z require creditors to \ndisclose the periodic rate that applies to an outstanding balance and its corresponding APR, as well as an \n\"effective\" or \"historical\" APR for the billing cycle, which includes not just interest but also finance charges imposed \nin the form of fees.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\n\n\nThe proposal contains a number of significant revisions to periodic statement disclosures. First, staff recommends \nthat the Board use its adjustment and exception authority to eliminate the requirement to disclose the effective APR \nfor HELOCs. Second, creditors would no longer be required to characterize particular costs on the periodic \nstatement as \"finance charges.\" Instead, costs would be described either as \"interest\" or as a \"fee.\" Third, interest \ncharges and fees imposed as part of the plan must be grouped together and totals disclosed for the statement \nperiod and year to date. To facilitate compliance, the proposal would include sample forms illustrating the revisions.\n\nThe effective APR. Under TILA, the \"effective\" APR disclosed on periodic statements reflects the cost of interest \nand certain other finance charges imposed during the statement period. For example, for a cash advance, the \neffective APR reflects both interest and any flat or proportional fee assessed for the advance. For the reasons \ndiscussed below, staff recommends eliminating the requirement to disclose the effective APR.\n\nCreditors believe that the effective APR should be eliminated. They believe that consumers do not understand the \neffective APR, including how it differs from the corresponding (interest rate) APR, why it is often \"high,\" and which \nfees the effective APR reflects. Creditors say they find it difficult, if not impossible, to explain the effective APR to \nconsumers who call them with questions or concerns. They note that callers sometimes believe, erroneously, that \nthe effective APR signals a prospective increase in their interest rate, and they may make uninformed decisions as \na result And, creditors say, even if the consumer does understand the effective APR, the disclosure does not \nprovide any more information than a disclosure of the total dollar costs for the billing cycle. Moreover, creditors say \nthat the effective APR is arbitrary and inherently inaccurate, principally because it amortizes the cost for credit over \nonly one month (billing cycle) even though the consumer may take several months (or longer) to repay the debt.\n\nConsumer groups acknowledge that the effective APR is not well understood by consumers, but argue that it \nnonetheless serves a useful purpose by showing the higher cost of some credit transactions. They contend the \neffective APR helps consumers decide each month whether to continue using the account, to shop for another \ncredit product, or to use an alternative means of payment such as a debit card. Consumer groups also contend that \nreflecting costs, such as cash advance fees and balance transfer fees, in the effective APR creates a \"sticker \nshock\" and alerts consumers that the overall cost of a transaction for the cycle is high and exceeds the advertised \ncorresponding APR. This shock, they say, may persuade some consumers not to use certain features on the \naccount, such as cash advances, in the future. In their view, the utility of the effective APR would be maximized if it \nreflected all costs imposed during the cycle (rather than only some costs as is currently the case).\n\nAs part of consumer testing conducted by the Board on credit cards in relation to the December 2008 Open-End \nFinal Rule, consumer awareness and understanding of the effective APR was evaluated, as well as whether \nchanges to the presentation of the disclosure could increase awareness and understanding. The overall results of \nthis testing demonstrated that most consumers do not understand the effective APR.\n\nBased on this consumer testing and other factors, staff recommends that the Board propose to eliminate the \nrequirement to disclose the effective APR. Under this proposal, creditors offering HELOCs would be required to \ndisclose interest and fees in a manner that is more readily understandable and comparable across institutions. The \nBoard eliminated the effective APR disclosure for open-end (not home-secured) credit in the December 2008 Open-\nEnd Final Rule. Staff believes that this approach can more effectively further the goals of consumer protection and \nthe informed use of credit for HELOCs as well.\n\nFees and interest costs. Currently, creditors must identify on periodic statements any \"finance charges\" that have \nbeen added to the account during the billing cycle; creditors typically list these charges with other transactions, such \nas purchases or cash advances, chronologically on the statement. The finance charges must be itemized by type. \nThus, interest charges might be described as \"finance charges due to periodic rates.\" Charges such as late-\npayment fees, which are not \"finance charges,\" are typically disclosed individually and interspersed among other \ntransactions.\n\nStaff drew on consumer testing for open-end (not home-secured) credit, the results of which staff believes apply \nequally to HELOCs, to recommend a number of changes to the required HELOC disclosures related to finance \n\n\n\ncharges. Under the proposal, creditors would be required to group all charges together and describe them in a \nmanner consistent with consumers' general understanding of costs (\"interest charge\" or \"fee\"), without regard to \nwhether the charges would be considered \"finance charges,\" \"other charges,\" or neither. If different periodic rates \napply to different types of transactions, creditors would be required to itemize interest charges for the statement \nperiod by type of transaction (for example, interest on cash advances) or group of transactions subject to different \nperiodic rates.\n\nIn addition, the proposal would require creditors to disclose the total fees and total interest imposed for the cycle, as \nwell as year-to-date totals for interest charges and fees, an amendment finalized for open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit in the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule. The year-to-date figures are intended to help consumers \nunderstand annualized costs and the overall cost of their HELOC better than does the effective APR. Staff intends \nto conduct consumer testing of periodic statement notices for HELOCs during the comment period for this proposal.\n\nE. Change-in-Terms Notices\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires creditors to send, in most cases, notices 15 days before the effective date of \ncertain changes in the account terms. Advance notice is not required in all cases; for example, if an interest rate \nincreases due to a consumer's default or delinquency, notice has been required, but not in advance of the rate \nincrease. In addition, no notice (either advance or contemporaneous) has been required if the specific change is set \nforth in the account agreement.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nStaff recommends that the Board propose to revise the change-in-terms rules for HELOCs to parallel in most \nrespects the revisions adopted for open-end (not home-secured) credit in the December 2008 Open-End Final \nRule, including the content, timing, and format of such notices. The recommended revisions to change-in-terms \nnotice requirements for HELOCs are intended to improve consumers' awareness about changes to their account \nterms or increased rates due to delinquency, default, or other reason disclosed in the agreement, and to enhance \nconsumers' ability to make alternative financial choices if necessary.\n\nThere are three major components of the proposal regarding change-in-terms notices. First, the proposal would \nexpand the circumstances in which consumers receive advance notice of changed terms, including increased rates. \nSecond, the proposal would provide consumers with earlier notice -- 45 days in advance of the effective date of the \nchange rather than 15 days. Third, the proposal would introduce format requirements to make the disclosures about \nchanges in terms, including increased rates, more effective.\n\nRate increases. Currently, a change-in-terms notice is not required if the agreement between the consumer and the \ncreditor specifically sets forth the change and the specific triggering event. In the December 2008 Open-End Final \nRule, the Board expressed concern that the imposition of penalty rates might come as a costly surprise to \nconsumers who are not aware of, or do not understand, what behavior constitutes a default under the credit \nagreement. The Board also stated that it believed that consumers would be the most likely to notice and be \nmotivated to act to avoid the imposition of the penalty rate if they receive a specific notice alerting them of an \nimminent rate increase, rather than a general disclosure stating the circumstances when a rate might increase.\n\nStaff believes that the same reasoning applies in the case of HELOCs, although the circumstances under which a \npenalty rate may be imposed on a HELOC are more restricted than for credit cards. The HELOC proposal would \nalso require advance notice of any increased rates due to a triggering event specified in the agreement, such as \nloss of an employee preferred rate because the consumer leaves the creditor's employ.\n\nTiming. Staff recommends that the requirement for notice 15 days in advance of the effective date of a change be \nchanged to require notice 45 days in advance, for the same reasons the Board adopted this requirement for open-\nend (not home-secured) credit. As discussed in the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule, shorter notice periods, \nsuch as 30 days or one billing cycle, may not provide consumers with sufficient time to shop for and possibly obtain \nalternative financing, or to make other financial adjustments. The 45-day advance notice requirement refers to when \n\n\n\nthe change-in-terms notice must be sent, but it may take several days for the consumer to receive the notice. As a \nresult, staff believes that the 45-day advance notice requirement would give consumers, in most cases, at least one \ncalendar month after receiving a change-in-terms notice to seek alternative financing or otherwise to mitigate the \nimpact of an unexpected change in terms.\n\nStaff also recommends that the Board solicit comment on whether it may be more difficult to seek alternative \nfinancing or otherwise mitigate the impact of a change in terms for HELOCs than for credit cards. Staff further \nrecommends the Board solicit comment on whether, because changes in terms are more narrowly restricted for \nHELOCs than for credit card accounts, the impact on consumers of term changes for HELOCs is likely to be less \nsevere than for credit cards and thus whether the proposed time period is likely adequate.\n\nFormat. Few format requirements apply to change-in-terms disclosures. As with account-opening disclosures, \ncreditors commonly intersperse change-in-terms notices with other amendments to the account agreement, and \nboth are provided in pamphlets in small print and dense prose. Consumer testing conducted for the December 2008 \nOpen-End Final Rule suggests that consumers tend to set aside change-in-terms notices when they are presented \nas a separate pamphlet inserted in the periodic statement. Testing also revealed that consumers are more likely to \nidentify the changes to their account correctly if the changes in terms are summarized in a tabular format.\n\nStaff therefore recommends that the Board propose that if a changed term is one that must be provided in the \naccount-opening summary table, creditors must also provide that change in a summary table to enhance the \neffectiveness of the change-in-terms notice. Further, if a notice enclosed with a periodic statement discusses a \nchange to a term that must be disclosed in the account-opening summary table, or announces that a default rate \nwill be imposed on the account, a table summarizing the impending change would have to appear on the periodic \nstatement, directly above the transaction list. Staff intends to conduct consumer testing of HELOC change-in-terms \nnotices with a tabular format during the comment period on this proposal.\n\nF. Additional Protections\n\nAccount Terminations. TILA and Regulation Z currently permit a creditor to terminate a HELOC for several reasons, \nincluding when the consumer has \"fail[ed] to meet the repayment terms of the agreement for any outstanding \nbalance.\" The proposal would interpret this provision to mean that a creditor may not terminate a HELOC plan for \npayment-related reasons unless the consumer has failed to make a required minimum periodic payment for more \nthan 30 days after the due date for that payment. Staff recommends requesting comment on whether a delinquency \nthreshold of more than 30 days is appropriate or whether some other time period would better achieve the purposes \nof TILA.\n\nThe proposal is principally intended to protect consumers from so-called \"hair-trigger\" terminations based on minor \npayment infractions. Overall, the proposal is intended to strike a more equitable balance between creditors' \nauthority to protect themselves against risk (and, for depositories, to ensure their safety and soundness) and \neffective protection of HELOC consumers from constraints on their credit privileges that do not correspond with \nreasonable expectations.\n\nSuspensions and credit limit reductions based on a significant decline in the property value. TILA and Regulation Z \npermit a creditor temporarily to suspend advances or reduce a credit line on a HELOC when \"the value of the \ndwelling that secures the plan declines significantly below the dwelling's appraised value for purposes of the plan.\" \nThe commentary provides a \"safe harbor\" standard for determining whether a decline is significant: specifically, a \ndecline in value is significant if it results in the initial difference between the credit limit and the available equity (the \n\"equity cushion\") diminishing by 50 percent.\n\nConcerns have been expressed to staff that the existing safe harbor may not be a viable standard for the higher \ncombined loan-to-value (CLTV) HELOCs made in recent years. For loans nearing or exceeding 100 percent CLTV \nwhen originated, for example, a decline in value of a few dollars could result in more than a 50 percent decline in \nthe creditor's equity cushion, because the equity cushion was zero or close to zero at origination. For these higher \nCLTV loans in particular, creditors have indicated uncertainty about how to determine whether a decline in value is \n\n\n\n\"significant.\" For their part, consumer advocates have expressed concerns that the lack of guidance on the proper \napplication of the safe harbor allows creditors to take action based on nominal declines in value.\n\nTo address these concerns, staff recommends that the Board propose to revise the staff commentary to delineate \ntwo \"safe harbors\" on which creditors could rely to determine whether a decline in property value is \"significant\":\n\n. First, for plans with a CLTV at origination of 90 percent or higher, a five (5) percent reduction in the property \nvalue on which the HELOC terms were based would constitute a significant decline in value.\n\n. Second, for plans with a CLTV at origination of under 90 percent, the existing safe harbor would apply, under \nwhich a decline in the value of the property securing the plan is significant if, as a result of the decline, the \ncreditor's equity cushion is reduced by 50 percent.\n\nSuspensions and credit limit reductions based on a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances. \nTILA and Regulation Z permit a creditor to suspend advances or reduce the credit limit of a HELOC when the \ncreditor reasonably believes that the consumer will be unable to fulfill the repayment obligations of the plan because \nof a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances.\" Some creditors appear uncertain about when \naction is permissible under this provision, and many have requested more detailed guidance. Consumer advocates \nhave expressed dissatisfaction with the guidance on this provision as well, voicing concerns that the lack of clear \nguidance may enable some creditors to take action when consumers are fully capable of meeting their repayment \nobligations.\n\nThe proposal is intended to protect consumers by ensuring that creditors exercise prudent judgment in relying on \nthis provision. Revised commentary would clarify that evidence of a material change in financial circumstances may \ninclude credit report information showing late payments or nonpayments on the part of the consumer, such as \ndelinquencies, defaults, or derogatory collections or public records related to the consumer's failure to pay other \nobligations. The proposed commentary would clarify that any payment failures relied on to show a material change \nin the consumer's financial circumstances would need to have occurred within a reasonable time from the date of \nthe creditor's review of the consumer's credit performance. A six-month safe harbor for this \"reasonable time\" would \nbe proposed.\n\nThe proposed commentary would retain the existing commentary's guidance stating that evidence supporting a \ncreditor's reasonable belief that a consumer is \"unable\" to meet the repayment terms may include the consumer's \nnonpayment of debts other than the HELOC. Under the proposal, these payment failures would have to have \noccurred within a reasonable time from the date of the creditor's review of the consumer's credit performance, with \na proposed six-month safe harbor. Staff recommends requesting comment on whether late payments of 30 days or \nfewer would be adequate evidence of a failure to pay a debt for purposes of this provision, and whether and under \nwhat circumstances credit score declines alone might satisfy the requirements of this provision.\n\nReinstatement of accounts. Regulation Z requires creditors to reinstate credit privileges once no circumstances \npermitting a freeze or credit limit reduction under the statute or regulation exist. Recently, due to declining property \nvalues and for other reasons, consumers' HELOCs have been suspended and their credit limits reduced more often \nthan in the past. Consumer groups and other federal agencies have raised concerns about whether consumers are \nproperly informed about the creditor's obligation to reinstate credit lines and consumers' rights to request \nreinstatement, and staff independently researched the reinstatement practices of several HELOC creditors. As a \nresult, staff believes that additional guidance is appropriate. The proposed changes are intended to ensure that \nconsumers have a meaningful opportunity to request reinstatement and to have this request investigated. Major \nproposed revisions include the following:\n\n. Requiring additional information in notices of suspension or reduction about consumers' ongoing right to \nrequest reinstatement and creditors' obligation to investigate this request.\n\n\n\n. Requiring creditors to complete an investigation of a request within 30 days of receiving the request and to \nprovide notice of the results to consumers whose credit privileges will not be restored.\n\n. Requiring creditors to cover the costs associated with investigating the first reinstatement request made by \nthe consumer after the line is suspended or reduced.\n\nConclusion\n\nStaff recommends that the Board publish for public comment the draft proposed amendments to Regulation Z's \nrules for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling and open-end credit transactions \nsecured by a consumer's dwelling. Staff requests the authority to make minor technical corrections to the Federal \nRegister notice as necessary prior to publication to comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, or the Congressional Review Act, or to conform to the requirements of the Office of the Federal \nRegister.\n\nWednesday,\n\nAugust 26, 2009\n\nPart III\n\nFederal Reserve\n\n12 CFR Part 226\n\nTruth in Lending; Proposed Rule\n\nFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\n12 CFR Part 226\n\n[Regulation Z; Docket No. R-1367]\n\nTruth in Lending\n\nAGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nACTION: Proposed rule; request for public comment.\n\nSUMMARY: The Board proposes to amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and \nthe Official Staff Commentary to the regulation, following a comprehensive review of TILA's rules for open-end \nhome-secured credit, or home-equity lines of credit (HELOCs).\n\nThe Board proposes changes to the format, timing, and content requirements for the four main types of HELOC \ndisclosures required by Regulation Z: disclosures at application; disclosures at account opening; periodic \nstatements; and change-in-terms notices. The Board proposes to replace disclosures required at the time that a \n\n\n\nconsumer applies for a HELOC with a one-page, Board-published summary of basic information and risks regarding \nHELOCs. The Board also proposes to move the timing of disclosures regarding a creditor's HELOC plan from the \ntime of application to within three business days after application, and to require the disclosures to include \nsignificant transaction-specific rates and terms.\n\nThe Board also proposes to provide additional guidance on when a creditor may temporarily suspend advances on \na HELOC or reduce the credit limit, and what a creditor's obligations are concerning reinstating such accounts. In \naddition, the proposal would limit the ability of a creditor to terminate a HELOC for payment-related reasons; a \ncreditor could do so only if the consumer failed to make a required minimum payment more than 30 days after the \ndue date for that payment. Changes to disclosure requirements related to suspension of HELOC advances, \nreduction of the credit limit, and account terminations are also proposed.\n\nDATES: Comments must be received on or before December 24, 2009.\n\nADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by Docket No. R-1367, by any of the following methods:\n\n.

The \nBoard proposes to replace disclosures required at the time that a consumer applies for a HELOC with a one-page, \nBoard-published summary of basic information and risks regarding HELOCs. The Board also proposes to move the \ntiming of disclosures regarding a creditor's HELOC plan from the time of application to within three business days \nafter application, and to require the disclosures to include significant transaction-specific rates and terms. At the \ntime of account opening, the creditor would be required to provide a disclosure with formatting similar to that \nprovided within three business days after application, but with certain changes such as additional information \nregarding fees. Formatting and other changes are proposed for the periodic statement, such as elimination of the \nrequirement to disclose the effective annual percentage rate (APR) and a requirement to disclose the total of \n\n\n\ninterest and fees for both the period and the year to date. HELOC creditors would be required to give consumers \nnotice of a change in a HELOC term at least 45 days in advance of the effective date of the change.\n\nThe Board also proposes to provide additional guidance on when a creditor may temporarily suspend advances on \na HELOC or reduce the credit limit, and what a creditor's obligations are concerning reinstating such accounts. In \naddition, the proposal would limit the ability of a creditor to terminate a HELOC for payment-related reasons; a \ncreditor could do so only if the consumer failed to make a required minimum payment more than 30 days after the \ndue date for that payment. Changes to disclosure requirements related to suspension of HELOC advances, \nreduction of the credit limit, and account terminations are also proposed.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. TILA and Regulation Z\n\nCongress enacted TILA based on findings that economic stability would be enhanced and competition among \nconsumer credit providers strengthened by the informed use of credit resulting from consumers' awareness of the \ncost of credit. The purposes of TILA are (1) to provide meaningful disclosure of credit terms to enable consumers to \ncompare credit terms available in the marketplace more readily and avoid the uninformed use of credit; and (2) to \nprotect consumers against inaccurate and unfair credit billing.\n\nTILA's disclosures differ depending on whether consumer credit is an open-end (revolving) plan or a closed-end \n(installment) loan. TILA also contains procedural and substantive protections for consumers. TILA is implemented \nby the Board's Regulation Z. An Official Staff Commentary interprets the requirements of Regulation Z. By statute, \ncreditors that follow in good faith Board or official staff interpretations are insulated from civil liability, criminal \npenalties, or administrative sanction.\n\nB. TILA and Regulation Z Provisions on Open-end Credit Secured by a Consumer's Dwelling\n\nIn 1989, the Board revised Regulation Z to implement the Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act of 1988 \n(Home Equity Loan Act) (Pub. L. 100-709, enacted on Nov. 23, 1988). See 15 U.S.C. 1637a, 1647, implemented by \n54 FR 24670 (June 9, 1989) (1989 HELOC Final Rule). The 1989 revisions required creditors to disclose extensive \ninformation about HELOCs to consumers at the time of application and again when consumers open a HELOC \nplan. They also imposed substantive limitations on HELOC creditors--principally by prohibiting changing the interest \nrate and other terms except under very limited circumstances. Since 1989, the Board has revised the HELOC \nprovisions in the regulation and staff commentary from time to time as necessary, although the disclosure \nrequirements and substantive limitations have remained substantially the same. See, e.g., 56 FR 13751 (April 4, \n1991); 60 FR 15463 (March 24, 1995); 63 FR 16669 (April 6, 1998); 66 FR 17329 (March 30, 2001); 72 FR 63462 \n(November 9, 2007).\n\nIn January 2009, the Board published final rules regarding open-end (not home-secured) credit (74 FR 5244 \n(January 29, 2009)) (January 2009 Regulation Z Rule), which were the result of the Board's comprehensive review \nof Regulation Z's open-end (not home-secured) credit rules. At that time, the Board indicated that it was also \nreviewing open-end home-secured credit rules. This proposal reflects the Board's review of all aspects of \nRegulation Z and accompanying Official Staff Commentary related to open-end home-secured credit, or HELOCs. \nThe Board is not at this time, however, specifically addressing issues related to rescinding HELOCs, and requests \ncomment in the proposal on any needed changes to Regulation Z provisions and commentary regarding reverse \nmortgages.\n\nC. HELOC Market Trends\n\n\n\nBoard and other research has tracked a number of changes in the HELOC market since 1989. One important trend \nis that HELOCs have become much more popular with consumers: in 1988, 5.6% of homeowners had HELOCs; 1 \nin 1998, 10.6% of homeowners had HELOCs; and by 2007, the percentage of homeowners with HELOCs had \njumped to 18.4%. 2 A number of factors may have contributed to this trend, such as low interest rates compared \nwith other forms of consumer credit, appreciation in home values, the deductibility of interest payments on \nmortgage debt, and changes in mortgage practices. 3 The uses of HELOCs have remained relatively constant, with \nthe highest uses in the areas of home improvement and debt consolidation. 4 Beginning in the late 1990s, \nconsumers increased their use of HELOCs for expenses such as vehicle purchases, education, and vacations. 5 \nMany HELOC consumers today, as in the past, use their lines as an emergency source of funds. 6\n\nAs home prices rose in the past decade, more creditors entered the HELOC market and creditors became more \nwilling to extend HELOCs to consumers with little equity in their homes. 7 When the Board published the 1989 \nHELOC Final Rule, it was commonly expected that most HELOC borrowers would, at their maximum credit line \nlimit, retain around 20 percent of their home equity. See comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6. By the mid-2000s, more creditors \nwere willing to lend HELOCs at a combined loan-to-value ratio of 100 percent or more, and, despite home value \nappreciation, the overall percentage of equity remaining in homes was appreciably lower than in earlier years. 8 The \nBoard's Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that the average outstanding dollar amount of a HELOC grew from \n$ 24,000 in 1998 to $ 39,000 in 2007. 9\n\nThe recent economic downturn, a central component of which has been declining property values, has dampened \nthe availability of HELOCs and reversed some of the overall trends in the HELOC market. The Board believes, \n\n1 Glenn Canner, Charles Luckett, and Thomas Durken, \"Home Equity Lending,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin (May 1989).\n\n2 Brian Bucks, Arthur Kennickell, Traci Mach, Kevin Moore, \"Changes in U.S. FamilyFinances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from \nthe Survey of Consumer Finances,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin (Feb. 2009) and accompanying tables at http:// \nwww.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/OSS/oss2/2007/ scf2007home.html.\n\n3 Id.\n\n4 Glenn Canner, Charles Luckett, and Thomas Durken, \"Recent Developments in Home Equity Lending,\" Federal Reserve \nBulletin (April 1998); see also Brian Bucks, Arthur Kennickell, Traci Mach, Kevin Moore, \"Changes in U.S. FamilyFinances from \n2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin (Feb. 2009) and accompanying \ntables at http://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/OSS/oss2/ 2007/scf2007home.html.\n\n5 Id.\n\n6 Supra note 2.\n\n \n\n \n\n7 Id.\n\n8 Id.\n\n9 Id.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/OSS/oss2/2007/\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/OSS/oss2/\n\n\nhowever, that a resurgence of these trends may occur once property values stabilize. The Board expects that \nfactors such as the flexibility HELOC borrowers have to draw on a line as needed and the tax deductibility of \ninterest on home-secured debt should continue to make HELOCs appealing to consumers over the long term.\n\nFinally, in response to the economic challenges of the last few years, creditors have relied more than in the past on \nprovisions in Regulation Z that allow them to terminate HELOC plans, suspend advances on lines, and reduce the \ncredit limit. As a result, many questions regarding the requirements and limitations of these provisions have been \nraised with the Board.\n\nII. Summary of Major Proposed Changes\n\nThe Board proposes content, format, and timing changes to the four main types of HELOC disclosures governed by \nRegulation Z: (1) Disclosures at application; (2) disclosures at account opening; (3) periodic statements; and (4) \nchange-in-terms notices. The proposal also provides additional guidance and protections, as well as revised \ndisclosure requirements, related to account terminations, line suspensions and credit limit reductions, and \nreinstatement of accounts.\n\nDisclosures at Application. Format, timing, and content changes are proposed to make the disclosures currently \nrequired at application more meaningful and easy for consumers to use. The proposed changes include:\n\n. Eliminating the requirement to provide a multiple-page disclosure of generic rates and terms of the creditor's \nHELOC products, as well as the requirement to provide the Board-published brochure explaining HELOC products \nand risks entitled, \"What You Should Know about Home Equity Lines of Credit.\" (HELOC brochure)\n\n. Requiring creditors to provide a new one-page Board publication summarizing basic information and risks \nregarding HELOCs entitled, \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit.\"\n\n. Replacing the application disclosure of generic rates and terms with a transaction-specific disclosure that must be \ngiven within three days after application. This disclosure would:\n\n. Provide information about rates and fees, payments, and risks in a tabular format.\n\n. Highlight whether the consumer will be responsible for a balloon payment.\n\n. Present payment examples based on both the current rate available and the maximum possible rate for the \nHELOC.\n\nDisclosures at Account Opening. The proposal would retain the existing requirement to provide consumers with \ntransaction-specific information about rates, terms, payments, and risks at the time of account opening. To facilitate \ncomparison between terms provided within three business days after application and terms available at account-\nopening, the proposal would prescribe formatting for this information similar to that of the proposed disclosure to be \nprovided within three business days after application.\n\nPeriodic Statements. To make disclosures on periodic statements more understandable, the proposal would revise \nthe format and content of the periodic statement for HELOCs, largely conforming to the periodic statement \nprovisions finalized in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule for credit cards. The proposed changes include:\n\n. Eliminating the disclosure of the effective APR.\n\n. Grouping fees and interest charges separately, and requiring disclosure of separate totals of interest and fees for \nboth the period and the year to date.\n\n\n\nChange-in-Terms Notices. The proposal would revise the format and content of the change-in-terms notice, largely \nconforming to the change-in-terms provisions finalized in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule. To improve \nconsumer protection, proposed changes include:\n\n. Expanding the circumstances under which advance written notice of a rate change is required.\n\n. Increasing advance notice of a change in a HELOC term from 15 to 45 days in advance of the effective date of the \nchange.\n\nAccount Terminations. The proposal would prohibit creditors from terminating an account for payment-related \nreasons until the consumer has failed to make a required minimum periodic payment more than 30 days after the \ndue date for that payment. The Board is requesting comment on whether a delinquency threshold of more than 30 \ndays or some other time period is appropriate.\n\nSuspensions and Credit Limit Reductions. The proposal contains a number of additional consumer protections \nrelated to temporary suspensions of advances and credit limit reductions. The proposed changes include:\n\n. Establishing a new safe harbor for suspending or reducing a line of credit based on a \"significant\" decline in \nproperty value. For HELOCs with a combined loan-to-value ratio at origination of 90 percent or higher, a five \npercent decline in the property value would be \"significant.\"\n\n. Providing additional guidance regarding the information on which a creditor may rely to take action based on a \nmaterial change in the consumer's financial circumstances, such as the type of credit report information that would \nbe appropriate to consider.\n\nReinstatement of Accounts. The proposal contains additional requirements regarding reinstating accounts that have \nbeen temporarily suspended or reduced. The proposed changes include:\n\n. Requiring additional information in notices of suspension or reduction about consumers' ongoing right to request \nreinstatement and creditors' obligation to investigate this request.\n\n. Requiring creditors to complete an investigation of a request for reinstatement within 30 days of receiving a \nrequest for reinstatement and to give a notice of the investigation results to consumers whose lines will not be \nreinstated.\n\nIII. The Board's Review of Open-End Credit Rules\n\nA. Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemakings\n\nDecember 2004 ANPR. The Board's current review of Regulation Z's open-end credit rules was initiated in \nDecember 2004 with an advance notice of proposed rulemaking. 10 69 FR 70925 (December 8, 2004). At that time, \nthe Board announced its intent to conduct its review of Regulation Z in stages, focusing first on the rules for open-\nend (revolving) credit accounts that are not home-secured, chiefly general-purpose credit cards and retailer credit \n\n10 The review was initiated pursuant to requirements of section 303 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory \nImprovement Act of 1994, section 610(c) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, and section 2222 of the Economic Growth and \nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. An announcednotice of proposed rulemaking is published to Obtain preliminary \ninformation prior to issuing a proposed rule or, in some cases, deciding whether to issue a proposed rule.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ncard plans. The December 2004 ANPR sought public comment on a variety of specific issues relating to three \nbroad categories: the format of open-end credit disclosures, the content of those disclosures, and the substantive \nprotections provided for open-end credit under the regulation. The December 2004 ANPR solicited comment on the \nscope of the Board's review, and also requested commenters to identify other issues that the Board should address \nin the review.\n\nOctober 2005 ANPR. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Public Law 109-8, \nenacted on April 20, 2005 (the Bankruptcy Act) primarily amended the federal bankruptcy code, but also contained \nseveral provisions amending TILA. The Bankruptcy Act's TILA amendments principally deal with open-end credit \naccounts and require new disclosures on periodic statements, on credit card applications and solicitations, and in \nadvertisements.\n\nIn October 2005, the Board published a second ANPR to solicit comment on implementing the Bankruptcy Act \namendments (October 2005 ANPR). 70 FR 60235, October 17, 2005. In the October 2005 ANPR, the Board stated \nits intent to implement the Bankruptcy Act amendments as part of the Board's ongoing review of Regulation Z's \nopen-end credit rules.\n\nB. Notices of Proposed Rulemakings\n\nJune 2007 Proposal. The Board published proposed amendments to Regulation Z's rules for open-end plans that \nare not home-secured in June 2007. 72 FR 32948 (June 14, 2007). The goal of the proposed amendments was to \nimprove the effectiveness of the disclosures that creditors provide to consumers at application and throughout the \nlife of an open-end (not home-secured) account. In developing the proposal, the Board conducted consumer \nresearch, in addition to considering comments received on the two ANPRs. Specifically, the Board retained a \nresearch and consulting firm (ICF Macro) to assist the Board in using consumer testing to develop proposed model \nforms. The proposal would have made changes to format, timing, and content requirements for the five main types \nof open-end credit disclosures governed by Regulation Z: (1) Credit and charge card application and solicitation \ndisclosures; (2) account-opening disclosures; (3) periodic statement disclosures; (4) change-in-terms notices; and \n(5) advertising provisions.\n\nMay 2008 Proposal. In May 2008, the Board published revisions to several disclosures in the June 2007 Proposal \n(May 2008 Proposal). 73 FR 28866 (May 19, 2008). In developing these revisions the Board conducted additional \nconsumer testing in consultation with ICF Macro. In addition, the May 2008 Proposal contained proposed \namendments to Regulation Z that complemented a proposal published by the Board, along with the Office of Thrift \nSupervision and the National Credit Union Administration, to adopt rules prohibiting specific unfair acts or practices \nregarding credit card accounts under their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act. See 15 U.S.C. \n57a(f)(1). 73 FR 28904 (May 19, 2008).\n\nMay 2009 Proposal. In May 2009, the Board issued proposals to clarity provisions of the January 2009 Final Rule \n(see below). 74 FR 20784 (May 5, 2009). Along with other federal banking agencies, the Board also issued \nproposals to clarify provisions of the January 2009 UDAP Final Rule (see below). 74 FR 20804 (May 5, 2009).\n\nC. Final Rulemakings\n\nJanuary 2009 Final Rule. In January 2009, the Board issued final rules for open-end credit that is not home-secured \n(i.e., the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule). The goal of the amendments to Regulation Z was to improve the \neffectiveness of the disclosures that creditors provide to consumers at application and throughout the life of an \nopen-end (not home-secured) account. The Board adopted changes to format, timing, and content requirements for \nthe five main types of open-end credit disclosures governed by Regulation Z: (1) Credit and charge card application \n\n\n\nand solicitation disclosures; (2) account-opening disclosures; (3) periodic statement disclosures; (4) change-in-\nterms notices; and (5) advertising provisions. Certain additional protections for consumers were adopted as well.\n\nJanuary 2009 UDAP Final Rule. In January 2009, the Board and other federal banking agencies jointly issued rules \nto prohibit institutions from engaging in certain acts or practices regarding consumer credit card accounts. 74 FR \n5498 (January 29, 2009).\n\nD. Consumer Testing\n\nA principal goal for the Regulation Z review is to produce revised and improved disclosures that consumers will be \nmore likely to understand and use in their decisions, while at the same time not creating undue burdens for \ncreditors. Currently, Regulation Z requires HELOC creditors to provide generic disclosures regarding various terms \nand features of the creditor's HELOC plans at application, along with a lengthy, Board-published brochure \nexplaining HELOC products. The creditor does not have to provide a transaction-specific disclosure for HELOCs \nuntil the consumer opens the account. During the life of the plan, the creditor is required to provide periodic \nstatements and change-in-terms notices as applicable.\n\nIn 2007, the Board retained ICF Macro, a research and consulting firm that specializes in designing and testing \ndocuments to conduct consumer testing to help the Board's review of Regulation Z's disclosures. Beginning in the \nfall of 2008, ICF Macro worked closely with the Board to conduct several tests on HELOC disclosures in different \ncities throughout the United States. The HELOC testing consisted of five rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews. \nThe goals of these interviews were to learn more about what information consumers read when they receive \nHELOC disclosures, to research how easily consumers can find various pieces of information in these disclosures, \nand to test consumers' understanding of certain HELOC-related words and phrases.\n\nSome of the key methods and findings of the consumer testing are summarized below. ICF Macro also issued a \nreport of the results of the testing for HELOCs, which is available on the Board's public Web site: \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov.\n\nDevelopment and testing of Regulation Z disclosures. The Board worked with ICF Macro to develop and test \nseveral types of disclosures, including:\n\n. A Board publication to be provided at application, entitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of \nCredit\";\n\n. A transaction-specific TILA disclosure to be provided within three business days of application, but no later than at \naccount-opening; and\n\n. A transaction-specific TILA disclosure to be provided at the time the consumer opens the account.\n\nThe Board revised two additional HELOC disclosures: a periodic statement and a change-in-terms notice that must \nbe provided after account opening as applicable. The Board intends to test these two disclosures during the \ncomment period. In addition, the Board developed model clauses for proposed notices required in connection with \nterminating, suspending or reducing a HELOC, as well as reinstating suspended or reduced HELOCS, and may test \nthese clauses during the comment period.\n\nTesting. The primary goal of the Board's consumer testing was to develop clear and conspicuous model HELOC \ndisclosure forms that would enable borrowers easily to identify material terms of the plan and to compare such \nterms among various plans in order to make informed decisions about HELOCs. The Board also wanted to gain a \nbetter understanding of what information consumers need to receive early in the process when shopping for \nHELOCs, when such information should be provided, what form it should take, and how it can be integrated into the \noverall shopping process to facilitate informed consumer decision-making regarding HELOCs.\n\n\n\nBeginning in the fall of 2008, five rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews with a total of 50 participants were \nconducted in different cities throughout the United States. The consumer testing groups comprised participants \nrepresenting a range of ethnicities, ages, educational levels, and levels of experience with home equity borrowing. \nEach round of testing involved testing a set of model disclosure forms, including currently required disclosures \ndescribed above. Interview participants were asked to review model forms and provide their reactions, and were \nthen asked a series of questions designed to test their understanding of the content. Data were collected on which \nelements and features of each form were most successful in providing information clearly and effectively. The \nfindings from each round of interviews were incorporated in revisions to the model forms for the following round of \ntesting.\n\nCognitive interviews on existing disclosures. Participants in the first two rounds of testing were shown an \napplication disclosure based on a sample disclosure conforming to the existing HELOC application disclosure \nsamples in Appendix G of Regulation Z and currently used by a financial institution. This form provided required \ninformation in a mostly narrative format. The goals of these interviews were to learn more about what information \nconsumers read when they receive current disclosures; to research how easily consumers can find various pieces \nof information in these disclosures; and to test consumers' understanding of certain HELOC-related words and \nphrases.\n\nParticipants found this form difficult to read and understand, and their responses to follow-up questions showed \nthat it was also difficult for them to identify information in the text. For example, several participants in the first two \nrounds of testing became confused when reviewing the application disclosure because they could not find their \ninterest rate, and were surprised when told that the rate was not on the form. Other participants incorrectly assumed \nthat one of the rates shown in a payment example on the application disclosure was being offered to them, when in \nfact that rate was used for illustrative purposes. When the same information was presented in a tabular format, \nparticipants commented that the information was easier to understand and had more success answering \ncomprehension questions. As a result, after the second round of testing, the decision was made to use a tabular \nformat for all model disclosure forms.\n\n1. Initial design of disclosures for testing. The results from the first two rounds of testing, and similar findings from \ntesting of closed-end mortgage disclosures conducted by the Board at the same time, called into question the \nusefulness of the current generic application disclosures for consumers. As a result, three new types of disclosure \nwere developed and tested:\n\n(1) A one-page disclosure developed by the Board entitled, \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of \nCredit\" (\"Key Questions\" document) that summarized the most important information in the HELOC brochure in a \nshorter, question-and-answer format found effective with consumers;\n\n(2) A disclosure to be provided not later than three business days after application that would include information \nabout the terms and features of the creditor's HELOC plans currently required at application, but also transaction-\nspecific information; and\n\n(3) A similar form that would be provided when the consumer opens the account. The content of the new \ntransaction-specific HELOC disclosure that would be provided three days after application would be similar to that \nof the current application disclosure, except that it would include information specific to the consumer based on \ninitial underwriting--most notably, the specific APR and credit limit. The content of the account opening disclosure \nwould be similar, except that it would provide additional information about fees.\n\n2. Additional cognitive interviews and revisions to disclosures. The \"Key Questions\" document tested very well in \nsubsequent rounds; all participants indicated that they would find it useful, and most found it very clear and easy-to-\nread. As a result, the Board is proposing to require lenders to provide the \"Key Questions\" document to prospective \nborrowers instead of the HELOC brochure.\n\nModel forms for the transaction-specific HELOC disclosures to be provided three days after application were first \ntested in the third round and participants overwhelmingly indicated that they would prefer to receive a transaction-\n\n\n\nspecific disclosure soon after application, even if it meant that they would not receive a disclosure of terms before \nthey applied. The remaining two rounds of testing focused on developing, testing and refining the two transaction-\nspecific disclosures (i.e., that would be provided within three business days of application and at account opening), \nrather than variations of the generic application disclosure currently required.\n\nTesting results. Specific findings from the consumer testing are discussed in detail throughout the \nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION where relevant. 11 This section highlights certain key findings.\n\nConsumer testing showed that consumers seldom contact more than one loan originator when looking for a \nHELOC and generally go to their current mortgage provider, a prior lender, or a bank with which they have an \nexisting banking relationship. Consumer testing indicated that consumers generally do not comprehend how \nHELOCs work, especially the draw and repayment periods. Consumer comprehension of the costs and effects of \nvarious terms significantly increased when consumers reviewed model forms developed by the Board and ICF \nMacro. Most participants agreed that they would prefer to receive specific information about the HELOC terms that \nwould apply to them shortly after application rather a generic disclosure currently provided to all borrowers on or \nwith the application. Consumer testing also showed that consumers prefer to receive a detailed breakdown of fees \nrequired to open the account early in the application process to help them understand what costs to anticipate in \nobtaining a HELOC. Thus, the Board is proposing to replace the generic program disclosure required at application \nwith disclosures that include key terms specific to the consumer, such as the APR and credit limit, within three \nbusiness days after application.\n\nMost consumers tested found the generic HELOC program disclosures and HELOC brochure required at \napplication too dense and difficult to understand. When the same information was presented in plain language, \nsegregated in a tabular format, participants found the information easier to understand and had more success \nanswering comprehension questions. Thus, under the proposal, the revised TILA disclosure would explain more \ncomplicated terms in plain language and present them in a tabular format.\n\nA large number of participants erroneously concluded that the rate and payment information shown in the currently \nrequired historical example table showed their exact monthly payments when in fact it showed how the interest \nrate and monthly payments fluctuated over the preceding 15 years based on a $ 10,000 example. Most participants \nidentified the interest rate fluctuation as the most important information in the historical payment example. For these \nreasons, the proposed disclosures include a statement providing the high and low interest rates for the preceding \n15 years but do not include the table showing the interest rate and corresponding monthly payments for each year.\n\nCreditors typically incorporate disclosures required at the time a HELOC account is opened into the account \nagreement. Consumer testing indicated, however, that consumers commonly do not review their account \nagreements, which are often in small print and dense prose. When consumers were presented with a revised \naccount-opening disclosure based on the tabular format of the revised early disclosure, their comprehension of \ncomplex terms significantly increased. Thus, the proposal would require creditors to provide a table summary of key \nterms applicable to the account at account opening, with similar formatting as the disclosure proposed to be \nprovided within three days after application. Consumer testing showed that setting apart the most important terms \nin this way better ensures that consumers are apprised of those terms. Moreover, the similarity in presentation and \nstructure of the early and account-opening disclosures enables consumers to focus on and compare key terms at \nboth stages of the process.\n\n11 The report by ICF Macro summarizing the findings from theconsumer testing is available on the Board's Web site at http:// \nwww.federalreserve.gov .\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/\n\n\nThe Board did not test model periodic statement and change-in-terms notices for HELOCs, but intends to do so \nduring the comment period for this proposal. The Board worked with ICF Macro, however, to develop model \nperiodic statements and change-in-terms notices for HELOCs largely based on the results of consumer testing \nconducted for credit cards for the Board's January 2009 Regulation Z rule. Many consumers more easily noticed \nthe number and amount of fees when the fees were itemized and grouped together with interest charges. \nConsumers also noticed fees and interest charges more readily when they were located near the disclosure of the \ntransactions on the account. Thus, under the proposal, creditors would be required to group all charges together \nand describe them in a manner consistent with consumers' general understanding of costs (\"interest charge\" or \n\"fee\"), without regard to whether the charges would be considered \"finance charges,\" \"other charges\" or neither \nunder the regulation.\n\nRegarding change-in-terms notices, consumer testing for the Board's January 2009 Regulation Z Rule on credit \ncards indicated that, much like the account-opening disclosures, consumers may not typically read such notices \nbecause they are often in small print and dense prose. To enhance the effectiveness of change-in-terms notices, \nthe proposed rules would require the creditor to include a table summarizing any changed terms. Consumer testing \nindicates that consumers may not typically look at the notices if they are provided as separate inserts given with \nperiodic statements. Thus, under the proposal, a table summarizing the change would have to appear on the \nperiodic statement, where consumers are more likely to notice the changes.\n\nAdditional testing during and after comment period. During the comment period, the Board will work with ICF Macro \nto conduct additional testing of model disclosures. After receiving comments from the public on the proposal and \nthe proposed disclosure forms, the Board will work with ICF Macro to further revise model disclosures based on \ncomments received, and to conduct additional rounds of cognitive interviews to test the revised disclosures. After \nthe cognitive interviews, quantitative testing will be conducted. The goal of the quantitative testing is to measure \nconsumers' comprehension of the newly-developed disclosures relative to existing disclosures and formats.\n\nE. Other Outreach and Research\n\nThroughout the review process leading to this proposal, the Board met or conducted conference calls with industry \nand consumer group representatives, as well as consulted with other federal banking agencies. The Board also \nreviewed HELOC disclosures currently used by creditors, internal Board research on home equity lending, and \nsurveys on HELOC usage and trends. 12\n\nF. Reviewing Regulation Z in Stages\n\nBased on the comments received and its own analysis, the Board is proceeding with a review of Regulation Z in \nstages. In January 2009, the Board published final rules regarding open-end (not home-secured) credit (74 FR \n5244 (January 29, 2009) (January 2009 Regulation Z Rule), which were the result of the Board's comprehensive \nreview of Regulation Z's open-end (not home-secured) credit rules. At that time, the Board indicated that it was also \nreviewing open-end home-secured credit rules. This proposal reflects the Board's review of all aspects of \n\n12 Surveys reviewed include: Brian Bucks, Arthur Kennickell, Traci Mach, Kevin Moore, \"Changes in U.S. FamilyFinances from \n2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin (Feb. 2009); Alan Greenspan and \nfames Kennedy, \"Sources and Uses of Equity Extracted from Homes,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series, Divisions of \nResearch & Statistics and Monetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board (2007-20); Glenn Canner et al., \"Recent Developments in \nHome Equity Lending,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin (April 1998); Consumer Bankers Ass'n, \"Home Equity Loan Study\" \n(2005,2007); and American Bankers Ass'n, \"ABA Home Equity Lending Survey Report\" (2005),\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRegulation Z and accompanying Official Staff Commentary related to open-end home-secured credit. The Board is \nnot at this time, however, specifically addressing issues related to rescinding HELOCs, and requests comment in \nthe proposal on any needed changes to Regulation Z provisions and commentary regarding reverse mortgages.\n\nG. Implementation Period\n\nThe Board contemplates providing creditors sufficient time to implement any revisions that may be adopted. The \nBoard seeks comment on an appropriate implementation period.\n\nIV. The Board's Rulemaking Authority\n\nTILA mandates that the Board prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of the act. TILA also specifically \nauthorizes the Board, among other things, to do the following:\n\n. Issue regulations that contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, or that provide for such \nadjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, that in the Board's judgment are necessary or proper to \neffectuate the purposes of TILA, facilitate compliance with the act, or prevent circumvention or evasion. 15 U.S.C. \n1604(a).\n\n. Exempt from all or part of TILA any class of transactions if the Board determines that TILA coverage does not \nprovide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection. The Board must consider \nfactors identified in the act and publish its rationale at the time it proposes an exemption for comment. 15 U.S.C. \n1604(f).\n\n. Require additional disclosures for HELOC plans. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8), 1637a(a)(14).\n\nIn the course of developing the proposal, the Board has considered information gathered from industry and \nconsumer representatives during outreach meetings and calls, consultations with other federal banking agencies, \nthe Board's experience in implementing and enforcing Regulation Z, and the results obtained from testing various \ndisclosure options in controlled consumer tests. For the reasons discussed in this proposal, the Board believes this \nproposal is appropriate pursuant to the authorities noted above.\n\nV. Discussion of Major Proposed Revisions\n\nThe goal of the proposed revisions is to improve the effectiveness of the Regulation Z disclosures that must be \nprovided to consumers for open-end credit transactions secured by the consumer's dwelling, and to strengthen \nsubstantive protections for HELOC consumers. To shop for and understand the cost of credit, consumers must be \nable to identify and understand the key terms of a HELOC, which can be very complex. The proposed revisions to \nRegulation Z are intended to provide the most essential information to consumers when the information would be \nmost useful to them, as clearly and conspicuously as possible. The proposed revisions are expected to improve \nconsumers' ability to make informed credit decisions and enhance competition among HELOC originators. Many of \nthe changes are based on consumer testing for this proposal and the Board's overall review of Regulation Z.\n\nIn considering the proposed revisions, the Board sought to ensure that the proposal would not reduce access to \ncredit, and sought to balance the potential benefits for consumers with the compliance burdens imposed on \ncreditors. For example, the proposed revisions seek to provide greater certainty to creditors in identifying what costs \nmust be disclosed for HELOCs, and how those costs must be disclosed. More effective disclosures may also \nreduce confusion and misunderstanding, which may ease creditors' costs relating to consumer complaints and \ninquiries.\n\n\n\nA. Disclosures at Application\n\nRegulation Z requires creditors to provide to the consumer two types of disclosures at the time of application: a set \nof disclosures describing various features of a creditor's HELOC plans (the \"application disclosures\") and a home-\nequity brochure published by the Board (the \"HELOC brochure\"), which provides information about how HELOCs \nwork. Neither contains transaction-specific information about the terms of the HELOC dependent on underwriting, \nsuch as the APR or credit limit.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe proposal would require a creditor to provide to consumers at application a new one-page document published \nby the Board entitled, \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit\" (the \"Key Questions\" document). \nThe Board proposes eliminating the requirement for creditors to provide the HELOC brochure at application. In \naddition, the proposal would replace the application disclosures with transaction-specific HELOC disclosures (\"early \nHELOC disclosures\") that must be given within three business days after application (but no later than account \nopening).\n\n\"Key Questions\" document. Currently, a creditor is required to provide to a consumer the HELOC brochure or a \nsuitable substitute at the time an application for a HELOC is provided to the consumer. The HELOC brochure is \naround 20 pages long and provides general information about HELOCs and how they work, as well as a glossary of \nrelevant terms and a description of various features that can apply to HELOCs.\n\nThe proposal would eliminate the requirement for creditors to provide to consumers the HELOC brochure with \napplications. The Board's consumer testing on HELOC disclosures has shown that consumers are unlikely to read \nthe HELOC brochure because of its length. Instead, the proposal would require a creditor to provide the new \"Key \nQuestions\" document that would be published by the Board. This one-page document is intended to be a simple, \nstraightforward and concise disclosure informing consumers about HELOC terms and risks that are important to \nconsider when selecting a home-equity product, including potentially risky features such as variable rates and \nballoon payments. The \"Key Questions\" document was designed based on consumers' preference for a question-\nand-answer tabular format, and refined in several rounds of consumer testing.\n\nB. Disclosures Within Three Days After Application\n\nRegulation Z currently requires the disclosures that must be provided on or with an application to contain \ninformation about the creditor's HELOC plans, including the length of the draw and repayment periods, how the \nminimum required payment is calculated, whether a balloon payment will be owed if a consumer only makes \nminimum required payments, payment examples, and what fees are charged by the creditor to open, use, or \nmaintain the plan. These disclosures do not include information dependent on a specific borrower's \ncreditworthiness or the value of the dwelling, such as a credit limit or the APRs offered to the consumer, because \nthe application disclosures are provided before underwriting takes place.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe Board's consumer testing on HELOC disclosures has shown that, because the current application disclosures \ndo not contain transaction-specific information applicable to the consumer, these disclosures may not provide \nmeaningful information to consumers to enable them to compare different HELOC products and to make informed \ndecisions about whether to open an HELOC plan. Thus, the proposal would replace the application disclosures with \ntransaction-specific \"early HELOC disclosures\" that must be given within three business days after application (but \nno later than account opening), and revise the format and content of the disclosures to make them more clear and \nconspicuous.\n\n\n\nContent of proposed early HELOC disclosures. The proposal would require creditors to include several additional \ndisclosures in the early HELOC disclosures not currently required to be disclosed as part of the application \ndisclosures, such as (1) the APRs and credit limit being offered; (2) a statement that the consumer has no \nobligation to accept the terms disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures; and (3) if the creditor has a provision for \nthe consumer's signature, a statement that a signature by the consumer only confirms receipt of the disclosure \nstatement. Based on consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board believes that \nthese new disclosures would provide meaningful information to consumers in deciding whether to open a HELOC \nplan.\n\nThe proposal would not require creditors to provide certain disclosures currently required to be disclosed as part of \nthe application disclosures. For example, currently creditors must disclose a 15-year historical payment example \ntable, a statement that the APR does not include costs other than interest, and a statement of the earliest time the \nmaximum rate could be reached. Based on consumer testing, the Board believes that these disclosures do not \nprovide meaningful information to consumers in deciding whether to open a HELOC plan. Other information that \nconsumer testing demonstrated would be helpful to consumers, however, would be required to be disclosed.\n\nMoreover, the proposal would revise certain information currently required to be disclosed in the application \ndisclosures. For example, the application disclosures currently must include several payment examples based on a \n$ 10,000 outstanding balance. Under the proposal, the Board would require in the early HELOC disclosures \npayment examples based on the full credit line. Also, to prevent \"information overload\" for consumers, the proposal \nwould allow a creditor to disclose information about only two payment plan options. Based on consumer testing, the \nBoard believes that the above revisions to the payment examples, and other revisions to the existing application \ndisclosures, would effectively provide meaningful information to consumers in deciding whether to open a HELOC \nplan.\n\nFormat requirements for the proposed early HELOC disclosures. The proposal would impose stricter format \nrequirements for the proposed early HELOC disclosures than currently are required for the application disclosures. \nThe application disclosures may be provided in a narrative form; under the proposal, the early HELOC disclosures \nmust be provided in the form of a table with headings, content, and format developed through multiple rounds of \nconsumer testing. In consumer testing, participants found information in a structured, tabular format easier to \nunderstand and had more success answering comprehension questions than when these participants reviewed \napplication disclosures in a narrative form.\n\nC. Disclosures at Account Opening\n\nRegulation Z requires creditors to disclose costs and terms before the first transaction is made for a HELOC. The \ndisclosures must specify the circumstances under which a \"finance charge\" may be imposed and how it will be \ndetermined, including charges such as interest, transaction charges, minimum charges, each periodic rate of \ninterest that may be applied to an outstanding balance (e.g., for purchases or cash advances) as well as the \ncorresponding APR. In addition, creditors must disclose the amount of certain charges other than finance charges, \nsuch as a late-payment charge. Currently, few format requirements apply to account-opening disclosures; typically \nthey are interspersed among other contractual terms in the creditor's account agreement.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe proposal would revise the account-opening disclosure requirements in two significant ways. First, the proposal \nwould require a tabular summary of key terms. Second, the proposal would reform how and when cost disclosures \nmust be made.\n\nAccount-opening summary table. The proposal seeks to make the cost disclosures provided at account opening \nmore conspicuous and easier to read. Accordingly, the proposal identifies specific costs and terms that creditors \nwould be required to summarize in a table. This account opening table would be substantially similar to the early \n\n\n\nHELOC disclosure table that would be provided within three business days after application, with two major \nexceptions. First, the account-opening table would show only the payment plan chosen by the consumer, rather \nthan a maximum of two plans required in the early HELOC disclosures. Second, the account-opening table would \ncontain transaction fees and penalty fees not required to be disclosed in the early HELOC disclosure table. Despite \nthese differences between the two tables, the Board believes that consumers could use the new table provided at \naccount opening to compare the terms of their accounts to the early HELOC disclosure table. Consumers would no \nlonger be required to search for the information in the credit agreement.\n\nHow charges are disclosed. Under the current rules, a creditor must disclose any \"finance charge\" or \"other charge\" \nin the written account-opening disclosures. In addition, the regulation identifies fees that are not considered to be \neither \"finance charges\" or \"other charges\" and, therefore, need not be included in the account-opening disclosures. \nThe distinctions among finance charges, other charges, and charges that do not fall into either category are not \nalways clear. Examples of included or excluded charges are in the regulation and commentary, but these examples \ncannot provide definitive guidance in all cases. This uncertainty can pose legal risks for creditors that act in good \nfaith to comply with the law. Creditors are subject to civil liability and administrative enforcement for under-\ndisclosing the finance charge or otherwise making erroneous disclosures, so the consequences of an error can be \nsignificant. Furthermore, over-disclosure of rates and finance charges is not permitted by Regulation Z for open-end \ncredit.\n\nThe fee disclosure rules also have been criticized as being outdated and impractical. These rules require creditors \nto provide fee disclosures at account opening, which may be months, and possibly years, before a particular \ndisclosure is relevant to the consumer, such as when the consumer calls the creditor to request a service for which \na fee is imposed. In addition, an account-related transaction may occur by telephone, when a written disclosure is \nnot feasible.\n\nThe proposed rule is intended to respond to these criticisms while still giving full effect to TILA's requirement to \ndisclose credit charges before they are imposed. Accordingly, under the proposal, the revised rules would (1) \nspecify precisely the charges that creditors must disclose in writing at account opening (e.g., interest, account-\nopening fees, transaction fees, annual fees, and penalty fees such as for paying late), which would be listed in the \nsummary table, and; (2) permit creditors to disclose certain optional charges orally or in writing before the consumer \nagrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge. These proposed changes correspond to amendments adopted \nin the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule applicable to open-end (not home-secured) credit, but would not change \ncurrent substantive restrictions on permissible changes in HELOC terms.\n\nD. Periodic Statements\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires creditors to provide periodic statements reflecting the account activity for the billing \ncycle (typically, one month). In addition to identifying each transaction on the account, creditors must identify each \n\"finance charge\" using that term, and each \"other charge\" assessed against the account during the statement \nperiod. Creditors must disclose the periodic rate that applies to an outstanding balance and its corresponding APR. \nCreditors also must disclose an \"effective\" or \"historical\" APR for the billing cycle, which includes not just interest \nbut also finance charges imposed in the form of fees.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe proposal contains a number of significant revisions to periodic statement disclosures. First, the Board \nrecommends eliminating the requirement to disclose the effective APR for HELOCs. Second, creditors would no \nlonger be required to characterize particular costs on the periodic statement as \"finance charges.\" Instead, costs \nwould be described either as \"interest\" or as a \"fee.\" Third, interest charges and fees imposed as part of the plan \nmust be grouped together and totals disclosed for the statement period and year to date. To facilitate compliance, \nthe proposal would include sample forms illustrating the revisions.\n\n\n\nThe effective APR. The \"effective\" APR disclosed on periodic statements reflects the cost of interest and certain \nother finance charges imposed during the statement period. For example, for a cash advance, the effective APR \nreflects both interest and any flat or proportional fee assessed for the advance. For the reasons discussed below, \nthe Board recommends eliminating the requirement to disclose the effective APR.\n\nIn general, creditors believe that the effective APR should be eliminated. They believe that consumers do not \nunderstand the effective APR, including how it differs from the corresponding (interest rate) APR, why it is often \n\"high,\" and which fees the effective APR reflects. Creditors say that they find it difficult, if not impossible, to explain \nthe effective APR to consumers who call them with questions or concerns. They note that callers sometimes \nbelieve, erroneously, that the effective APR signals a prospective increase in their interest rate, and they may make \nuninformed decisions as a result. And, creditors say, even if the consumer does understand the effective APR, the \ndisclosure does not provide any more information than a disclosure of the total dollar costs for the billing cycle. \nMoreover, creditors say the effective APR is arbitrary and inherently inaccurate, principally because it amortizes the \ncost for credit over only one month (billing cycle) even though the consumer may take several months (or longer) to \nrepay the debt.\n\nConsumer groups acknowledge that the effective APR is not well understood, but argue that it nonetheless serves a \nuseful purpose by showing the higher cost of some credit transactions. They contend the effective APR helps \nconsumers decide each month whether to continue using the account, to shop for another credit product, or to use \nan alternative means of payment such as a debit card. Consumer groups also contend that reflecting costs, such as \ncash advance fees, in the effective APR creates a \"sticker shock\" and alerts consumers that the overall cost of a \ntransaction for the cycle is high and exceeds the advertised corresponding APR. This shock, they say, may \npersuade some consumers not to use certain features on the account, such as cash advances, in the future. In their \nview, the utility of the effective APR would be maximized if it reflected all costs imposed during the cycle (rather \nthan only some costs as is currently the case).\n\nAs part of consumer testing conducted by the Board on credit cards in relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z \nRule, consumer awareness and understanding of the effective APR was evaluated, as well as whether changes to \nthe presentation of the disclosure could increase awareness and understanding. The overall results of this testing \ndemonstrated that most consumers do not correctly understand the effective APR.\n\nBased on this consumer testing and other factors, the Board proposes to eliminate the requirement to disclose the \neffective APR. Under this proposal, creditors offering HELOCs would be required to disclose interest and fees in a \nmanner that is more readily understandable and comparable across institutions. The Board believes that this \napproach can more effectively further the goals of consumer protection and the informed use of credit for HELOCs.\n\nFees and interest costs. Currently, creditors must identify on periodic statements any \"finance charges\" that have \nbeen added to the account during the billing cycle; creditors typically list these charges with other transactions, such \nas purchases or cash advances, chronologically on the statement. The finance charges must be itemized by type. \nThus, interest charges might be described as \"finance charges due to periodic rates.\" Charges such as late-\npayment fees, which are not \"finance charges,\" are typically disclosed individually and interspersed among other \ntransactions.\n\nThe Board drew on consumer testing for open-end (not home-secured) credit, the results of which the Board \nbelieves apply equally to HELOCs, to recommend a number of changes to the required HELOC disclosures related \nto finance charges. As under rules adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule for open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit, this proposal would require HELOC creditors to group all charges together and describe them in a \nmanner consistent with consumers' general understanding of costs (\"interest charge\" or \"fee\"), without regard to \nwhether the charges would be considered \"finance charges,\" \"other charges,\" or neither. If different periodic rates \napply to different types of transactions, creditors would be required to itemize interest charges for the statement \nperiod by type of transaction (for example, interest on cash advances) or group of transactions subject to different \nperiodic rates.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the proposal would require creditors to disclose the (1) total fees and (2) total interest imposed for the \ncycle, as well as year-to-date totals for interest charges and fees. The year-to-date figures are intended to help \nconsumers understand annualized costs and the overall cost of their HELOC better than does the effective APR. \nThe Board intends to conduct consumer testing of periodic statement notices for HELOCs during the comment \nperiod for this proposal.\n\nE. Change-in-Terms Notices\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires creditors to send, in most cases, notices 15 days before the effective date of \ncertain changes in the account terms. Advance notice is not required in all cases; for example, if an interest rate \nincreases due to a consumer's default or delinquency, notice has been required, but not in advance of the rate \nincrease. In addition, no notice (either advance or contemporaneous) has been required if the specific change is set \nforth in the account agreement.\n\nSummary of Proposed Revisions\n\nThe Board proposes to revise the change-in-terms rules for HELOCs to parallel in most respects the revisions \nadopted for open-end (not home-secured) credit in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, including the content, \ntiming, and format of such notices. The Proposed revisions to change-in-terms notice requirements for HELOCs are \nintended to improve consumers' awareness about changes to their account terms or increased rates due to \ndelinquency, default, or other reason disclosed in the agreement, and to enhance consumers' ability to make \nalternative financial choices if necessary.\n\nThere are three major components of the proposal regarding change-in-terms notices. First, the proposal would \nexpand the circumstances in which consumers receive advance notice of changed terms, including increased rates. \nSecond, the proposal would provide consumers with earlier notice-45 days in advance of the effective date of the \nchange rather than 15 days. Third, the proposal would introduce format requirements to make the disclosures about \nchanges in terms, including increased rates, more effective.\n\nRate increases. Currently, a change-in-terms notice is not required if the agreement between the consumer and the \ncreditor specifically sets forth the change and the specific triggering event. In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, \nthe Board expressed concern that the imposition of penalty rates might come as a costly surprise to consumers \nwho are not aware of, or do not understand, what behavior constitutes a default under the credit agreement. The \nBoard also stated that it believed that consumers would be the most likely to notice and be motivated to act to \navoid the imposition of the penalty rate if they receive a specific notice alerting them of an imminent rate increase, \nrather than a general disclosure stating the circumstances when a rate might increase.\n\nThe Board believes that the same reasoning applies in the case of HELOCs, although the circumstances under \nwhich a penalty rate may be imposed on a HELOC are more restricted than for credit cards. The HELOC proposal \nwould also require advance notice of any increased rates due to a triggering event specified in the agreement, such \nas loss of an employee preferred rate because the consumer leaves the creditor's employ.\n\nTiming. The Board proposes that the requirement for notice 15 days in advance of the effective date of a change be \nchanged to require notice 45 days in advance, for the same reasons the Board adopted this requirement for open-\nend (not home-secured) credit. As discussed in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, shorter notice periods, such \nas 30 days or one billing cycle, may not provide consumers with sufficient time to shop for and possibly obtain \nalternative financing, or to make other financial adjustments. The 45-day advance notice requirement refers to when \nthe change-in-terms notice must be sent, but it may take several days for the consumer to receive the notice. As a \nresult, the Board believes that the 45-day advance notice requirement would give consumers, in most cases, at \nleast one calendar month after receiving a change-in-terms notice to seek alternative financing or otherwise to \nmitigate the impact of an unexpected change in terms.\n\n\n\nThe Board is soliciting comment on whether it may be more difficult to seek alternative financing or otherwise \nmitigate the impact of a change in terms for HELOCs than for credit cards. The Board is also soliciting comment on \nwhether, because changes in terms are more narrowly restricted for HELOCs than for credit card accounts, the \nimpact on consumers of term changes for HELOCs is likely to be less severe than for credit cards and thus whether \nthe proposed time period is likely adequate.\n\nFormat. Few format requirements apply to change-in-terms disclosures. As with account-opening disclosures, \ncreditors commonly intersperse change-in-terms notices with other amendments to the account agreement, and \nboth are provided in pamphlets in small print and dense prose. Consumer testing conducted for the January 2009 \nRegulation Z Rule suggests that consumers tend to set aside change-in-terms notices when they are presented as \na separate pamphlet inserted in the periodic statement. Testing also revealed that consumers are more likely to \nidentify the changes to their account correctly if the changes in terms are summarized in a tabular format.\n\nThe Board therefore proposes that if a changed term is one that must be provided in the account-opening summary \ntable, creditors must also provide that change in a summary table to enhance the effectiveness of the change-in-\nterms notice. Further, if a notice enclosed with a periodic statement discusses a change to a term that must be \ndisclosed in the account-opening summary table, or announces that a default rate will be imposed on the account, a \ntable summarizing the impending change would have to appear on the periodic statement. The Board intends to \nconduct consumer testing of change-in-terms notices with a tabular format during the comment period for this \nproposal.\n\nF. Additional Protections\n\nAccount Terminations. Regulation Z currently permits a creditor to terminate a HELOC for several reasons, \nincluding when the consumer has \"fail[ed] to meet the repayment terms of the agreement for any outstanding \nbalance.\" The proposal would revise this provision to provide that a creditor may not terminate a HELOC plan for \npayment-related reasons unless the consumer has failed to make a required minimum periodic payment more than \n30 days after the due date for that payment. The Board is requesting comment on whether a delinquency threshold \nof more than 30 days is appropriate, or whether some other time period would better achieve the purposes of TILA.\n\nThe proposal is principally intended to protect consumers from so-called \"hair-trigger\" terminations based on minor \npayment infractions. Overall, the proposal is intended to strike a more equitable balance between creditors' \nauthority to protect themselves against risk (and, for depositories, to ensure their safety and soundness) and \neffective protection of HELOC consumers from constraints on their credit privileges that do not correspond with \nreasonable expectations.\n\nSuspensions and credit limit reductions based on a significant decline in the property value. Regulation Z permits a \ncreditor temporarily to suspend advances or reduce a credit line on a HELOC if \"the value of the dwelling that \nsecures the plan declines significantly below the dwelling's appraised value for purposes of the plan.\" The \ncommentary provides a \"safe harbor\" standard for determining whether a decline is significant: specifically, a \ndecline in value is significant if it results in the initial difference between the credit limit and the available equity (the \n\"equity cushion\") diminishing by 50 percent.\n\nConcerns have been expressed to the Board that the existing safe harbor may not be a viable standard for the \nhigher combined loan-to-value (CUTV) HELOCs made in recent years. For loans nearing or exceeding 100 percent \nCLTV when originated, for example, a decline in value of a few dollars could result in more than a 50 percent \ndecline in the creditor's equity cushion, because the equity cushion was zero or close to zero at origination. For \nthese higher CLTV loans in particular, creditors have indicated uncertainty about how to determine whether a \ndecline in value is \"significant.\" For their part, consumer advocates have expressed concerns that the lack of \nguidance on the proper application of the safe harbor allows creditors to take action based on nominal declines in \nvalue.\n\n\n\nTo address these concerns, the proposal would revise the staff commentary to delineate two \"safe harbors\" on \nwhich creditors could rely to determine whether a decline in property value is \"significant\":\n\n. First, for plans with a CLTV at origination of 90 percent or higher, a five (5) percent reduction in the property value \non which the HELOC terms were based would constitute a significant decline in value.\n\n. Second, for plans with a CLTV at origination of under 90 percent, the existing safe harbor would be retained, \nunder which a decline in the value of the property securing the plan is significant if, as a result of the decline, the \ncreditor's equity cushion is reduced by 50 percent.\n\nSuspensions and credit limit reductions based on a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances. \nRegulation Z permits a creditor to suspend advances or reduce the credit limit of a HELOC when \"the creditor \nreasonably believes that the consumer will be unable to fulfill the repayment obligations of the plan because of a \nmaterial change in the consumer's financial circumstances.\" Some creditors appear uncertain about when action is \npermissible under this provision, and many have requested more detailed guidance. Consumer advocates have \nexpressed dissatisfaction with the guidance on this provision as well, voicing concerns that the lack of clear \nguidance may enable some creditors to take action when consumers are fully capable of meeting their repayment \nobligations.\n\nThe proposal is intended to protect consumers by ensuring that creditors exercise prudent judgment in relying on \nthis provision. Revised commentary would clarify that evidence of a material change in financial circumstances may \ninclude credit report information showing late payments or nonpayments on the part of the consumer, such as \ndelinquencies, defaults, or derogatory collections or public records related to the consumer's failure to pay other \nobligations. The proposed commentary would clarify that any payment failures relied on to show a material change \nin the consumer's financial circumstances would need to have occurred within a reasonable time from the date of \nthe creditor's review of the consumer's credit performance. A six-month safe harbor for this \"reasonable time\" is \nproposed.\n\nThe proposed commentary would retain the existing commentary's guidance stating that evidence supporting a \ncreditor's reasonable believe that a consumer is \"unable\" to meet the repayment terms may include the consumer's \nnonpayment of debts other than the HELOC. Under the proposal, these payment failures would have to have \noccurred within a reasonable time from the date of the creditor's review of the consumer's credit performance, with \na proposed six-month safe harbor. The Board is requesting comment on whether late payments of 30 days or fewer \nwould be adequate evidence of a failure to pay a debt for purposes of this provision, and whether and under what \ncircumstances credit score declines alone might satisfy the requirements of this provision.\n\nReinstatement of accounts. Regulation Z requires creditors to reinstate credit privileges once no circumstances \npermitting a freeze or credit limit reduction under the statute or regulation exist. Recently, due to declining property \nvalues and for other reasons, HELOCs have been suspended and credit limits reduced more often than in the past. \nConsumer groups and other federal agencies have raised concerns about whether consumers are properly \ninformed about the creditor's obligation to reinstate credit lines and consumers' rights to request reinstatement, and \nthe Board independently researched the reinstatement practices of several creditors. As a result, the Board has \ndetermined that additional guidance is appropriate. The proposed changes are intended to ensure that consumers \nhave a meaningful opportunity to request reinstatement and to have this request investigated. Major proposed \nrevisions include the following:\n\n. Requiring additional information in notices of suspension or reduction about consumers' ongoing right to request \nreinstatement and creditors' obligation to investigate this request.\n\n. Requiring creditors to complete an investigation of a request within 30 days of receiving the request and to provide \nnotice of the results to consumers whose credit privileges will not be restored.\n\n. Requiring creditors to cover the costs associated with investigating the first reinstatement request by the \nconsumer.\n\n\n\nVI. Section-by-Section Analysis\n\nOther than in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 226.5b, unless otherwise indicated, references to the \"current\" or \n\"existing\" regulation and staff commentary refer to the version of Regulation Z and staff commentary finalized in the \nJanuary 2009 Regulation Z Rule. The regulation text and commentary in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule will \nnot go into effect until July 1, 2010, and certain changes to both the substance and effective date of these have \nbeen made by the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit Card Act), Public \nLaw 111-24, enacted on May 22, 2009. The Board determined, however, that it is appropriate for this proposed \nrulemaking to refer to rules that have been finalized and will go into effect in the near future, rather than the version \nof Regulation Z and the commentary now in effect but that will soon be obsolete. The section-by-section analysis of \n\u00a7 226.5b and references to \u00a7 226.5b refer to the version of Regulation Z and accompanying staff commentary \ncurrently in effect.\n\nSection 226.2 Definitions and Rules of Construction\n\n2(a)(6) Definition of Business Day Currently, \u00a7 226.2(a)(6) contains two definitions of \"business day.\" Under the \ngeneral definition, a \"business day\" is a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on \nsubstantially all of its business functions. However, for some purposes a more precise definition applies; \"business \nday\" means all calendar days except Sundays and specified federal legal public holidays for purposes of \ndetermining when disclosures are received under \u00a7\u00a7 226.15(e), 226.19(a)(1)(ii), 226.23(a), and 226.31(c)(1) and \n(2). The Board also recently adopted the more precise definition for purposes of the presumption in \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) \nthat consumers receive corrected disclosures three business days after they are mailed and for other timing \ndeterminations. See 74 FR 23289 (May 19, 2009). As discussed more fully below in the section-by-section analysis \nunder proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(e) and 226.9(j)(2), the Board is proposing to use the more precise definition of business \nday in providing presumptions of when consumers receive mailed disclosures required under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.5b(b) and 226.9(j)(1).\n\nSection 226.4 Finance Charge\n\nVarious provisions of TILA and Regulation Z specify how and when the cost of consumer credit expressed as a \ndollar amount, the \"finance charge,\" is to be disclosed. The rules for determining which charges make up the \nfinance charge are set forth in TILA Section 106 and Regulation Z \u00a7 226.4. 15 U.S.C. 1605. In the January 2009 \nRegulation Z Rule, the Board made several revisions to \u00a7 226.4. Some of the revisions, such as those relating to \ntransaction charges imposed by credit card issuers for obtaining cash advances from automated teller machines \n(ATMs) or making purchases in foreign currencies or foreign countries, affect all open-end credit, including HELOCs \nas well as open-end (not home-secured) credit. Other revisions made in the January 2009 rule affect only open-end \n(not home-secured) credit.\n\nCharges for Credit Insurance or Debt Cancellation or Suspension Coverage\n\nIn the case of charges for credit insurance, debt cancellation coverage, and debt suspension coverage, some of the \nrevisions affect all open-end credit, while others affect only open-end (not home-secured) credit. The Board is now \nproposing to revise \u00a7 226.4 as it applies to HELOCs in a manner generally paralleling the latter category of \nrevisions, as discussed further below.\n\nIn addition to the proposed revisions to \u00a7 226.4 discussed in this HELOC proposal, the Board is separately \nproposing a number of other revisions to \u00a7 226.4 and other sections of Regulation Z, regarding finance charge, \ncredit insurance, and debt cancellation or suspension coverage, in its proposal regarding closed-end mortgage \nlending under Regulation Z, published today elsewhere in this Federal Register. Some of these proposed revisions \n\n\n\nwould affect HELOCs as well as closed-end mortgage loans. These other proposals are discussed below; for a \ndetailed discussion, see the Board's separate Federal Register notice. The proposed regulatory text and proposed \nstaff commentary for \u00a7 226.4, as well as other affected sections, appear in the Board's separate Federal Register \nnotice.\n\nPremiums or other charges for credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance are finance charges if the \ninsurance or coverage is \"written in connection with\" a credit transaction. 15 U.S.C. 1605(b); \u00a7 226.4(b)(7). \nCreditors may exclude from the finance charge premiums for credit insurance if they disclose the cost of the \ninsurance and the fact that the insurance is not required to obtain credit. In addition, the statute requires creditors to \nobtain an affirmative written indication of the consumer's desire to obtain the insurance, which, as implemented in \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(1)(iii), requires creditors to obtain the consumer's initials or signature. 15 U.S.C. 1605(b). In 1996, the \nBoard expanded the scope of the rule to include plans involving charges or premiums for debt cancellation \ncoverage. See \u00a7 226.4(b)(10) and (d)(3). 61 FR 49237 (September 19, 1996.)\n\nThe January 2009 Regulation Z Rule amended the regulation to treat debt suspension coverage in the same way \nas debt cancellation coverage. Debt suspension is the creditor's agreement to suspend, on the occurrence of a \nspecified event, the consumer's obligation to make the minimum payment(s) that would otherwise be due. During \nthe suspension period, interest may continue to accrue or it may be suspended as well, depending on the plan. \nThus, under \u00a7 226.4(b)(10), charges for debt suspension coverage written in connection with a credit transaction \nare finance charges, unless excluded under \u00a7 226.4(d)(3). However, to exclude the cost of debt suspension \ncoverage from the finance charge, creditors are also required to inform consumers, as applicable, that the \nobligation to pay loan principal and interest is only suspended, and that interest will continue to accrue during the \nperiod of suspension. These revisions apply to all open-end plans (both HELOCs and open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit), as well as to closed-end credit transactions.\n\nInsurance or coverage sold after opening of an account. One of the revisions made in the January 2009 Regulation \nZ Rule affecting only open-end (not home-secured) credit involves the meaning of the phrase \"written in connection \nwith a credit transaction.\" Prior to the January 2009 rule, credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension \ncoverage sold after consummation of a closed-end credit transaction or after the opening of an open-end plan and \nupon a consumer's request was considered not to be \"written in connection with the credit transaction,\" and, \ntherefore, a charge for such insurance or coverage was not a finance charge. See comment 4(b)(7) and (8)-2. The \nBoard stated in its 2007 proposal for open-end (not home-secured) credit (72 FR 32945 (June 14, 2007) (June \n2007 Regulation Z Proposal) that it believed this approach remained sound for closed-end transactions, which \ntypically consist of a single transaction with a single advance of funds. However, in an open-end plan, where \nconsumers can engage in credit transactions after the opening of the plan, a creditor may have a greater \nopportunity to influence a consumer's decision whether or not to purchase credit insurance or debt cancellation or \nsuspension coverage than in the case of closed-end credit. Accordingly, the disclosure and consent requirements \nare important in open-end plans, even after the opening of the plan, to ensure that the consumer is fully informed \nabout the offer of insurance or coverage and that the decision to purchase it is voluntary. Therefore, the Board \nadopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule amendments to comment 4(b)(7) and (8)-2, to state that insurance \npurchased after an open-end (not home-secured) plan is opened is considered to be written \"in connection with a \ncredit transaction.\" New comment 4(b)(10)-2 provides the same treatment to purchases of debt cancellation or \nsuspension coverage. Therefore, purchases of voluntary insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage \nafter account opening trigger disclosure and consent requirements. This amendment does not apply to HELOCs; \nthe Board stated that it intended to consider this issue when the home-equity credit plan rules are reviewed in the \nfuture.\n\nThe Board proposes to apply the same rule to HELOCs. Thus, comments 4(b)(7) and (8)-2 and 4(b)(10)-2 would be \namended to state that credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage purchase after any open-end \nplan is opened is considered to be written in connection with a credit transaction, and therefore charges for such \ninsurance or coverage would be finance charges unless the disclosure and consent requirements under \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(1) and (3) are met. The Board believes that the same reasons for extending the \"written in connection \nwith\" rule to insurance or coverage purchased after the opening of an open-end (not home-secured) plan exist with \n\n\n\nregard to insurance or coverage purchased after the opening of a HELOC. Although the creditors' ability to \nterminate or restrict HELOC accounts is more limited than in the case of open-end (not home-secured) accounts, \nconsumers may not be aware of this difference and therefore consumers' decisions about whether to purchase \ninsurance or coverage may be influenced by concern about their continued access to credit, or about possible \nadverse changes to the terms and conditions of the account.\n\nTelephone sales of insurance or coverage. Another of the revisions made in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule \naffecting only open-end (not home-secured) credit involves sales of credit insurance or debt cancellation or \nsuspension coverage by telephone. Under \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (d)(3), creditors may exclude from the finance charge \ncredit insurance premiums and debt cancellation or suspension charges if the consumer signs or initials an \naffirmative written request for the insurance or coverage, after disclosure of the fact that the insurance or coverage \nis optional and of the cost.\n\nIn the June 2007 Regulation Z Proposal the Board proposed, and in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule adopted, \nan exception to the requirement to obtain a written signature or initials for telephone purchases of credit insurance \nor debt cancellation and debt suspension coverage on an open-end (not home-secured) plan. Under new \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(4), for telephone purchases, the creditor is permitted to make the disclosures orally and the consumer may \naffirmatively request the insurance or coverage orally, provided that the creditor (1) maintains evidence that \ndemonstrates that the consumer, after being provided the disclosures orally, affirmatively elected to purchase the \ninsurance or coverage; and (2) mailed the disclosures under \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) or (d)(3) within three business days after \nthe telephone purchase. Comment 4(d)(4)-1 provides that a creditor does not satisfy the requirement to obtain an \naffirmative request if the creditor uses a script with leading questions or negative consent. This new rule is \nconsistent with rules published by the federal banking agencies to implement Section 305 of the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act regarding the sale of insurance products by depository institutions, as well as guidance published by the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding the sale of debt cancellation and suspension products. See 12 \nCFR 208.81 et seq. regarding insurance sales; 12 CFR part 37 regarding debt cancellation and debt suspension \nproducts. HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b were not affected by this revision.\n\nThe Board adopted this approach pursuant to its exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105. \nSection 105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include \nfacilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. 15 \nU.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Section 105(f) authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions from coverage \nunder any part of TILA if the Board determines that coverage under that part does not provide a meaningful benefit \nto consumers in the form of useful information or protection. 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). Section 105(f) directs the Board \nto make this determination in light of specific factors. 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2). These factors are (1) the amount of the \nloan and whether the disclosure provides a benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction involving a loan \nof such amount; (2) the extent to which the requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more expensive the credit \nprocess; (3) the status of the borrower, including any related financial arrangements of the borrower, the financial \nsophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction, and the importance to the borrower of the credit, \nrelated supporting property, and coverage under TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of \nthe borrower; and (5) whether the exemption would undermine the goal of consumer protection.\n\nThe Board stated in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule that it considered each of these factors carefully, and \nbased on that review, believed it is appropriate to exempt, for open-end (not home-secured) plans, telephone sales \nof credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension plans from the requirement to obtain a written signature \nor initials from the consumer. Requiring a consumer's written signature or initials is intended to evidence that the \nconsumer is purchasing the product voluntarily; the rule contains safeguards intended to insure that oral purchases \nare voluntary. Under the rule, creditors must maintain tapes or other evidence that the consumer received required \ndisclosures orally and affirmatively requested the product. Comment 4(d)(4)-1 indicates that a creditor does not \nsatisfy the requirement to obtain an affirmative request if the creditor uses a script with leading questions or \nnegative consent. In addition to oral disclosures, under the proposal consumers will receive written disclosures \nshortly after the transaction.\n\n\n\nThe Board proposes to extend the telephone sales rule for credit insurance and debt cancellation or suspension \ncoverage, as adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, to HELOCs. Section 226.4(d)(4) would be amended \nto apply to all open-end credit, not only open-end (not home-secured) credit. The Board proposes this approach \npursuant to its exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105, and has considered the factors \nspecified in Section 105(1) as discussed above. The proposed rule contains safeguards to ensure that the purchase \nis voluntary. In addition, other proposed safeguards regarding eligibility restrictions and revised disclosures, \ndiscussed in the Board's separate proposal regarding closed-end mortgage lending provisions of Regulation Z and \npublished today elsewhere in the Federal Register, would apply to HELOCs as well as closed-end mortgage loans.\n\nThe fee for the credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage would also appear on the first \nmonthly periodic statement after the purchase, and, as applicable, thereafter. As discussed in the section-by-\nsection analysis under \u00a7 226.7, under the proposal fees, including insurance and debt cancellation or suspension \ncoverage charges, would be better highlighted on statements. Consumers who are billed for insurance or coverage \nthey did not purchase may dispute the charge as a billing error. At the same time, the proposed amendments \nshould facilitate the convenience to both consumers and creditors of conducting transactions by telephone. The \nproposed amendments, therefore, have the potential to better inform consumers and further the goals of consumer \nprotection and the informed use of credit.\n\nProposals Regarding Finance Charge and Credit Insurance, Debt Cancellation Coverage, and Debt Suspension \nCoverage Published in Separate Federal Register Notice\n\nAs noted above, in addition to the proposed amendments discussed above, the Board is separately proposing a \nnumber of amendments to the rules in \u00a7 226.4 regarding finance charge, and to the rules in \u00a7 226.4 and other \nsections of Regulation Z regarding credit insurance and debt cancellation or suspension coverage. These other \nproposed amendments are discussed in detail in the Board's separate Federal Register notice, published today \nand appearing elsewhere in this Federal Register. Also, the regulatory and staff commentary text for these \nproposed amendments appears in the Board's separate Federal Register notice. A brief discussion of these other \nproposed amendments follows.\n\n\"All-in\" finance charge. The Board is proposing to adopt, for closed-end mortgage lending under Regulation Z only, \nan \"all-in\" finance charge concept, under which all fees payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed \ndirectly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or condition of the extension of credit would be included in the \nfinance charge. Thus, many of the exclusions from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(a), (c), (d), and (e) would no \nlonger apply to closed-end mortgage loans. For example, for closed-end mortgage loans, charges for credit \ninsurance and debt cancellation or suspension coverage would be considered finance charges, whether or not the \ninsurance or coverage is optional and even though revised disclosures would be required.\n\nThe Board is not proposing this \"all-in\" finance charge approach for credit other than closed-end mortgage loans. \nThus, the proposed approach would not apply, for example, to closed-end non-mortgage credit, or to HELOCs or \nother open-end credit. As discussed below in the section-by-section analysis under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5 and 226.7, disclosures \nfor HELOCs would no longer be required to use the term \"finance charge,\" and would no longer be required to \ncontain a disclosure of the effective APR (i.e., an APR that includes not only interest but also other fees that \nconstitute finance charges). In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted these changes for open-end \n(not home-secured) credit. Therefore, the Board believes that changing the definition of finance charge for HELOC \naccounts would not have a material effect on the HELOC disclosures and accordingly is unnecessary. However, the \nBoard requests comment on whether there are reasons why consideration should be given to changing the \ndefinition of finance charge for HELOCs. For a detailed discussion of the Board's proposals regarding the \"all-in\" \nfinance charge for closed-end mortgage loans, see the Board's separate Federal Register notice published today.\n\nAge or employment eligibility criteria. The Board is proposing to add new \u00a7 226.4(d)(1)(iv) and (d)(3)(v) to permit \ncreditors to exclude a credit insurance premium or debt cancellation or suspension charge from the finance charge \nonly if the creditor determines at the time of enrollment that the consumer meets any applicable age or employment \neligibility criteria for the insurance or coverage. These provisions would apply to all open-end credit, including \n\n\n\nHELOCs, as well as to closed-end (non-real-property) credit. The Board is proposing these new provisions because \nsome creditors offer credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension products with eligibility restrictions, but may \nnot evaluate whether applicants actually meet the criteria at the time the applicants request the product. As a result, \nmany consumers may not discover until they file a claim that they were paying for a product for which they were not \neligible. For a detailed discussion of this proposal, see the Board's separate Federal Register notice published \ntoday. Note that, for HELOCs and other open-end credit in which the telephone purchase rule under \u00a7 226.4(d)(4) \ncould be used, the new conditions under proposed \u00a7 226.4(d)(1)(iv) and (d)(3)(v) would still apply.\n\nRevised disclosures for insurance or coverage. The Board is proposing to add model clauses that would provide \nclearer information to consumers about the optional nature and costs of credit insurance or debt cancellation or \nsuspension coverage. The model clauses would apply to open-end as well as closed-end credit transactions, and \nappear in Appendix G-16(C) for open-end credit and Appendix H-17(C) for closed-end credit. The disclosure \nlanguage is based on consumer testing conducted by the Board to determine whether consumers understood the \noptional nature and costs of credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage. In addition, the \ndisclosures would contain language about eligibility restrictions and a reference to the Board's Web site to learn \nmore about the product. These model clauses would be in addition to the Debt Suspension Model Clause found at \nAppendix G-16(A) for open-end credit and Appendix H-17(A) for closed-end credit. For a detailed discussion of this \nproposal, see the Board's separate Federal Register notice published today.\n\nSection 226.5 General Disclosure Requirements\n\nSection 226.5 contains the general requirements for open-end credit disclosures under Regulation Z, both for credit \ncards and other open-end (not home-secured) credit and for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. Section 226.5 \naddresses, among other requirements, that disclosures be clear and conspicuous, in writing, and in a form the \nconsumer can keep, as well as requirements concerning terminology, formats for disclosures, and timing of \ndisclosures. In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted a number of changes to the general \ndisclosure requirements for open-end (not home-secured) credit, but did not change the requirements applicable to \nHELOCs. The Board is now proposing to revise the format and other disclosure requirements for HELOCs in a \nmanner generally paralleling the revisions in the requirements for open-end (not home-secured) credit.\n\nIn addition to the proposed changes to the specific rules for disclosures, the Board proposes to adopt a new \ncomment 5-1 that would provide guidance in situations where a creditor is uncertain whether an open-end credit \nplan is covered by the \u00a7 226.5b rules for HELOCs or the rules for open-end (not home-secured) credit. The Board \nunderstands that there is uncertainty for creditors that offer open-end credit secured by real property, where it is \nunclear whether that property is, or remains, the consumer's dwelling. Such creditors may be uncertain how they \nshould comply with the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule. The Board solicited comment on this issue in the May \n2009 proposal regarding technical revisions and other changes to open-end (not home-secured) credit rules. 74 FR \n20784 (May 5, 2009) (May 2009 Regulation Z Proposal). The comment period ended on June 4, 2009. Financial \ninstitutions commenters suggested that creditors be permitted to treat all open-end credit secured by residential \nproperty as covered by \u00a7 226.5b, rather than the rules for open-end (not home-secured) credit, regardless of \nwhether the property is the consumer's dwelling. Consumer group commenters did not address this issue.\n\nProposed comment 5-1 generally permits creditors to assume that the property securing the line of credit is the \nprincipal residence or a second or vacation home of the consumer and, therefore, that the line of credit is covered \nby the HELOC rules. (The HELOC rules cover not only credit secured by consumer's principal residence, but also \ncredit secured by vacation and second homes, assuming the credit is for personal, family, or household purposes.) \nHowever, creditors are also permitted to investigate the actual use of the property. If the creditor ascertains that the \nproperty is not the consumer's principal residence or a second or vacation home, the creditor may comply with the \nrules applicable to open-end (not home-secured) credit under Regulation Z. In this case, if the credit plan is \naccessible by credit card, the creditor must comply with, in addition to the rules applicable to open-end credit \ngenerally, the rules for open-end (not home-secured) credit card plans under \u00a7 226.5a and associated sections in \n\n\n\nthe regulation. The Board requests comment on whether the proposed comment provides useful and appropriate \nguidance.\n\n5(a) Form of Disclosures\n\n5(a)(1) General\n\nParagraph 5(a)(1)(i)\n\nSection 226.5(a)(1)(i) requires that disclosures required under the regulation be clear and conspicuous. Comment \n5(a)(1)-1 states that the \"clear and conspicuous\" standard generally requires that disclosures be in a reasonably \nunderstandable form. The comment further states that disclosures for credit card applications and solicitations \nunder \u00a7 226.5a, and related disclosures such as those required to be in a tabular format under \u00a7 226.6(b)(1), must \nalso be readily noticeable to the consumer. Comment 5(a)(1)-3 explains that the disclosures subject to the readily \nnoticeable standard must be given in a minimum of 10-point font and cross-references the rule that the APR for \npurchases in an open-end (not home-secured) plan under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a(b)(1) and 226.6(b)(2)(i) must be in a minimum \n16-point font.\n\nThe Board proposes to revise comments 5(a)(1)-1 and -3 to apply the same standards to home-equity plan \ndisclosures as those applicable to the comparable disclosures for credit cards and other open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit. Specifically, the Board proposes to revise comments 5(a)(1)-1 and -3 to require that the following \nhome-equity disclosures be readily noticeable to the consumer, meaning that they must be provided in a minimum \nfont size of 10-point: disclosures required to be given in a tabular format within three business days after application \n(\u00a7 226.5b(b)); disclosures required to be given in a tabular format at account opening (\u00a7 226.6(a)(1)); change-in-\nterms disclosures required to be given in a tabular format (\u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B)); and disclosures required to be given \nin a tabular format when a rate is increased due to delinquency or default under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) (\u00a7 226.9(i)(4)). The \nproposal also adds a cross-reference to the 16-point minimum font size requirement for the APR in a home-equity \nplan under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) and 226.6(a)(2)(vi).\n\nThe Board believes that the same reasoning underlying the minimum font size requirements for open-end (not \nhome-secured) plan disclosures applies to the comparable home-equity plan disclosures. In the June 2007 \nRegulation Z Proposal, the Board stated its belief that special formatting requirements, such as a tabular format and \nfont size requirements, are needed to highlight for consumers the importance and significance of certain disclosures \nrequired at application or solicitation for a credit card, and at the opening of a credit card account. Similarly, for \ndisclosures that may appear on periodic statements, such as the change-in-terms disclosures under \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(2)(iii)(B) and disclosures when a rate is increased due to delinquency, default or as a penalty under \u00a7 \n226.9(g)(3)(ii), the Board stated that highlighting these disclosures by using a minimum 10-point font size is \nimportant because consumers do not expect to see these disclosures each billing cycle and because the changes \nmay have a significant impact on the consumer.\n\nConsumer comments on the June 2007 Regulation Z Proposal noted that credit card disclosures are in fine print \nand argued that disclosures should be given in a larger font. Many consumer and consumer group commenters \nsuggested that the regulation require a minimum 12-point font for disclosures. In consumer testing conducted by the \nBoard in the open-end (not home-secured) credit review demonstrated that participants were able to read and \nnotice information in a 10-point font. Consumer testing conducted by the Board in the home-equity credit review \nshowed the same result. Accordingly, the Board proposes to require that the HELOC disclosures discussed above \nmust be provided in a minimum 10-point font size.\n\nParagraph 5(a)(1)(ii)\n\nParagraph 5(a)(1)(ii)(A)\n\n\n\nSection 226.5(a)(1)(ii) requires that disclosures required by the regulation be given in writing and in a form that the \nconsumer may keep. Section 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) specifies several exceptions to the requirement that disclosures be \nin writing, including account-opening disclosures of charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) \nplan that are not required to be disclosed in a tabular format under \u00a7 226.6(b)(2) and related change-in-terms \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(ii)(B), when such charges change. The Board proposes to add a parallel exception, \napplicable to home-equity plans, for disclosures of certain charges not required to be given in tabular format at the \ntime of account opening and for related change-in-terms disclosures.\n\nThe Board believes that the same reasoning underlying the exception to the written disclosure requirement for \ncertain open-end (not home-secured) plan disclosures applies to home-equity plan disclosures. As discussed in the \nJanuary 2009 Regulation Z Rule, in permitting certain charges in open-end (not home-secured) credit to be \ndisclosed either orally or in writing (and after account opening, as discussed further under \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(ii) below), \nthe Board's goal was to better ensure that consumers receive disclosures at a time and in a manner in which they \nwould be likely to notice them. At account opening, both for open-end (not home-secured) plans and for HELOCs, \nwritten disclosure has obvious merit because account opening is a time when a consumer must assimilate \ninformation that may influence major decisions by the consumer about how, or even whether, to use the account. \nDuring the life of an account, however, a consumer may sometimes need to decide whether to purchase a single \nservice from the creditor that may not be central to the consumer's use of the account, such as an expedited \ntelephone payment service. The consumer may have become accustomed to purchasing similar services by \ntelephone for other financial products, such as credit cards, and expect to receive an oral disclosure of the charge \nfor the service during the same telephone call. Permitting oral disclosure of charges that are not central to the \nconsumer's use of the account would be consistent with consumer expectations and with the business practices of \ncreditors.\n\nAccordingly, the Board proposes to exempt from the written disclosure requirement the following HELOC \ndisclosures: charges not required to be in given in tabular format at account opening under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) (i.e., \ncharges that are not the most significant charges related to the plan) and related change-in-terms notices under \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1)(ii)(B). A creditor would not be permitted to increase the APR (assuming a rate increase were \npermissible at all) without providing written notice, because the APR is a disclosure required to be given in tabular \nformat. Of course, any change in terms in a HELOC subject to \u00a7 226.5b would have to be permissible under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f). For example, the charge for an expedited telephone payment service would not be permitted to be \nincreased; however, the charge could be decreased, or a new optional telephone payment service, with its \nassociated charge, could be introduced, because these would be beneficial changes permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(f).\n\nThe most significant charges would not be covered by the proposed exemption and would continue to have to be \ndisclosed in writing at account opening, because these charges would be required to be shown in the tabular \naccount-opening disclosures. For example, the annual fee, early termination fee, penalty fees such as late payment \nand over-the-credit-limit fees, and fees to use the account such as transaction fees would have to be disclosed in \nwriting at account opening in the tabular disclosure. Further, any changes in these charges (assuming a change \nwere permissible at all, which in most cases it would not be) would be required to be disclosed in a written change-\nin-terms notice under \u00a7 226.9(c). Paragraph 5(a)(1)(ii)(B)\n\nApplication disclosures. Section 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(B) lists several exceptions to the requirement that disclosures be in a \nform that the consumer may keep, including the disclosures required to be given at the time of application for a \nHELOC under \u00a7 226.5b(d) (to be redesignated \u00a7 226.5b(c) under the proposal). The Board proposes to eliminate \nthis exception because, as discussed in greater detail below in this section-by-section analysis under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5(b)(4) \nand 226.5b(b), the Board is proposing to change the timing and content of HELOC disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(c). \nUnder the proposal, these disclosures would be required to show the terms and conditions that would apply to the \nparticular consumer, rather than only describing the creditor's plans in general terms. In addition, \u00a7 226.5b(c) \ndisclosures would be given within three business days after application rather than at the time of application.\n\nThe purpose of the existing exception to the retainability requirement was to avoid requiring creditors to give \nconsumers a separate disclosure document, in addition to the application form itself. When proposing and adopting \n\n\n\nin final form the amendments to Regulation Z implementing the 1988 Home Equity Loan Act (cited above), the \nBoard noted that the exception from the retainability requirement would permit the creditor to place the disclosures \non the application form that the consumer would return to the creditor to apply for the plan. 54 FR 3063 (January \n23, 1989); 54 FR 24670 (June 9, 1989). This purpose for the exception from the retainability requirement would not \napply under the proposal because the relevant disclosures would be not be provided at the time of application, but \ninstead within three business days later.\n\nHome-equity brochure. The current regulation does not exempt the home-equity brochure required under \u00a7 \n226.5b(e) from the retainability requirement under the current regulation, even though the brochure is required to be \nprovided to a consumer at the time of application. One reason is that the brochure is not easily incorporated into the \napplication form itself. As discussed under \u00a7 226.5b(a) below, the Board is proposing to replace the brochure with a \nshorter disclosure serving the same purpose of informing consumers generally about home-equity plan features \nand risks (\"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit\" or \"Key Questions\" document). The \nretainability requirement would continue to apply to this disclosure; it would be a form developed and specifically \nprescribed by the Board, and therefore would not necessarily be readily incorporated into the application form itself.\n\nParagraph 5(a)(1)(iii)\n\nUnder \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(iii), a creditor may give a consumer open-end credit disclosures in electronic form, as long as \nthe creditor complies with the consumer notice and consent procedures and other applicable provisions of the \nElectronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). Under certain \ncircumstances, however, the disclosures required at application for a home-equity plan under \u00a7 226.5b (as well as \nthe application and solicitation disclosures for credit cards under \u00a7 226.5a and disclosures in open-end credit \nadvertising under \u00a7 226.16) may be provided to a consumer in electronic form without regard to the requirements of \nthe E-Sign Act. Section 226.5b(a)(3) (proposed to be redesignated \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2)), in turn, requires that for the \u00a7 \n226.5b disclosures to be provided in electronic form, the application must be accessed by the consumer in \nelectronic form and the disclosures must be provided on or with the application. The Board proposes to continue to \napply this exception from the E-Sign consumer notice and consent requirements to the disclosure that would be \nprovided to a consumer at application under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a) (i.e., \"Key Questions\" document).\n\nThe purpose of these exceptions from the E-Sign Act's notice and consent requirements is to facilitate credit \nshopping. When proposing these exceptions, the Board stated its belief that the exceptions would eliminate a \npotentially significant burden on electronic commerce without increasing the risk of harm to consumers: requiring \nconsumers to follow the notice and consent procedures of the E-Sign Act to access an online application, \nsolicitation, or advertisement is potentially burdensome and could discourage consumers from shopping for credit \nonline; at the same time, there appears to be little, if any, risk that the consumer will be unable to view the \ndisclosures online when they are already able to view the application, solicitation, or advertisement online. 72 FR \n63462 (November 9, 2007).\n\nThis exception would not be extended to the disclosures that would be provided within three business days after \napplication under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b). The credit shopping process takes place primarily when a consumer \nreviews applications and associated disclosures and decides whether to submit an application. Three business \ndays after the consumer has submitted an application, the consumer may have completed the credit shopping \nprocess. Requiring compliance with the E-Sign Act's notice and consent procedures for disclosures at this point \nwould not likely hinder credit shopping, and would ensure that the consumer is able and willing to receive \ndisclosures in electronic form. In addition, compliance with the E-Sign Act for disclosures provided within three \nbusiness days after application should not be unduly burdensome, because the time between application and three \ndays later should be sufficient for the creditor to carry out the E-Sign Act notice and consent procedures.\n\n5(a)(2) Terminology\n\nParagraph 5(a)(2)(ii)\n\n\n\n\"Finance charge\" and \"annual percentage rate.\" Section 226.5(a)(2) relates to terminology used in disclosures. \nSection 226.5(a)(2)(ii) requires that for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, the terms \"finance charge\" and \"annual \npercentage rate,\" when required to be disclosed with a corresponding amount or percentage rate, must be more \nconspicuous than any other required disclosure, with some exceptions. This regulatory provision implements \nsection 122(a) of TILA; 15 U.S.C. 1632(a).\n\nIn the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board eliminated the \"more conspicuous\" rule for open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit, using the Board's authority under TILA Section 105(a) to make \"such adjustments and exceptions \nfor any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of \nthis title, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.\" 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). The \nBoard concluded that requiring the terms \"annual percentage rate\" and \"finance charge\" to be more conspicuous \nthan other disclosures was unnecessary, because creditors would be required to emphasize APRs and certain \nother finance charges by disclosing them in a tabular format with a minimum 10-point font size (or 16-point font size \nas required for the APR for purchases). Furthermore, the Board noted that the use of the term \"finance charge\" in \ndisclosures for open-end (not home-secured) plans is no longer required; as a result, creditors would in many cases \nnot use the term \"finance charge\" at all.\n\nThe Board believes that the same reasoning applies to the terms \"finance charge\" and \"annual percentage rate\" \nwhen disclosed for home-equity plans. As for open-end (not home-secured) credit, for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b \nthe Board is proposing to require creditors to disclose the APR and certain other finance charges in a tabular format \nwith a minimum 10-point font size (or 16-point font size for the APR the first time it appears in the table). The Board \nis also proposing to eliminate the requirement that creditors use the term \"finance charge\" in disclosures for \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b (see discussion in this section-by-section analysis under \u00a7 226.7). Accordingly, under \nthe Board's authority in TILA Section 105(a) discussed above, the Board proposes to revise \u00a7 226.5(a)(2)(ii) to \neliminate the \"more conspicuous\" rule for the terms \"finance charge\" and \"annual percentage rate\" for home-equity \nplans. Comments 5(a)(2)-1, -2, and -3, providing guidance on the \"more conspicuous\" rule, would be deleted, and \ncomment 5(a)(2)-4 would be renumbered as 5(a)(2)-1.\n\n\"Borrowing period,\" \"repayment period,\" and \"balloon payment.\" The Board also proposes to revise \u00a7 226.5(a)(2)(ii) \nto require the use of the terms \"borrowing period,\" \"repayment period,\" and \"balloon payment\" in disclosures \nrequired to be given in tabular format in HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, as applicable. In consumer testing conducted \nby the Board to develop the proposed revised home-equity plan disclosures, consumers understood these terms. In \nparticular, consumers overall understood that the term \"borrowing period\" referred to the part of a HELOC term \nduring which consumers could obtain funds, whereas they did not clearly understand the alternative term \"draw \nperiod,\" which is used in the existing regulation's home-equity sample disclosures (Appendices G-14A and G-14B).\n\n\"Required\" for required credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage. Section 226.5(a)(2)(ii) would \nalso be revised to require that, if credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage is required as part of \nthe plan, the term \"required\" must be used and the program must be identified by its name. This would he parallel to \nthe requirement adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule for open-end (not home-secured) credit under \u00a7 \n226.5(a)(2)(iii) discussed below.\n\nParagraph 5(a)(2)(iii)\n\nSection 226.5(a)(2)(iii) contains three terminology requirements adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule for \nopen-end (not home-secured) credit. First, if credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage is \nrequired as part of the plan, the term \"required\" must be used and the program must be identified by its name. This \nrequirement is proposed to apply to HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b as well (under proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(2)(ii), as \ndiscussed above).\n\nSecond, \u00a7 226.5(a)(2)(iii) requires a creditor to use the term \"penalty APR\" as applicable. Third, \u00a7 226.5(a)(2)(iii) \nprohibits a creditor from using the term \"fixed\" to describe a rate unless the creditor also specifies a time period \n\n\n\nduring which the rate will be fixed and the rate will not increase during that period, or, if the creditor does not \ndisclose a time period during which the rate will be fixed, the rate will not increase while the plan is open.\n\nThese latter two rules would not be applied to HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b; accordingly, \u00a7 226.5(a)(2)(iii) would be \nrevised to exclude home-equity plans from the terminology requirements relating to the terms \"penalty APR\" and \n\"fixed.\" Regarding the \"penalty APR\" requirement, the Board's review of home-equity plans and HELOC creditor \npractices indicates that most HELOCs do not have penalty rates. Even if a penalty rate could apply, under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f) such a rate could apply to balances (both outstanding and future) only if an event permitting termination \nand acceleration of the plan, such as a significant payment default (more than 30 days late), has occurred. See \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii) and comment 5b(f)(2)(ii)-1. In general, rate increases of any kind, including application of \npenalty rates, are much more restricted for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b than for credit card accounts, in which \npenalty rates can be applied even for minor defaults (although only on future transactions). For these reasons, the \ndisclosures required for HELOCs, unlike those for credit card accounts, do not include penalty rates; see the \ndiscussion of this issue under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b and 226.6, below. Therefore, a terminology requirement relating to penalty \nrates is inapplicable.\n\nRegarding using the term \"fixed\" to describe a rate, the Board believes that the reason for the prohibition applicable \nto credit card accounts does not exist for HELOCs. Credit card accounts have been marketed as having \"fixed\" \nrates even though rates could be increased at any time and for any reason. The rates of HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b generally may only be changed in accordance with a publicly available index not under the control of the \ncreditor or due to a circumstance permitting termination and acceleration. Thus, HELOC rates are generally \nvariable, and would not be marketed as \"fixed.\"\n\n5(a)(3) Specific Formats\n\nSection 226.5(a)(3) contains formatting requirements applicable to credit card and other open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit, including tabular format requirements for applications and solicitations under \u00a7 226.5a, account-\nopening disclosures under \u00a7 226.6(b), disclosures accompanying checks that access a credit card account under \u00a7 \n226.9(b)(3), change-in-terms notices under \u00a7 226.9(c)(2), and notices of application of a penalty rate under \u00a7 \n226.9(g). Section 226.5(a)(3) also includes formatting requirements for periodic statements under \u00a7 226.7(b)(6) and \n(b)(13). In addition, this provision sets forth formatting requirements for HELOC disclosures at application under \u00a7 \n226.5b(b), but does not require use of a tabular format for these or any other HELOC disclosures.\n\nThe Board proposes to adopt tabular format requirements for HELOC disclosures, paralleling requirements adopted \nfor credit card and other open-end (not home-secured) credit in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule. Section \n226.5(a)(3)(ii) would be revised to require a tabular format for HELOC disclosures currently required to be provided \nat the time of application. (The timing of these disclosures would be changed from at application to within three \nbusiness days after application. See the discussion in this section-by-section analysis under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5(b)(4) and \n226.5b(b) below.) The tabular format requirement is discussed in detail under \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)) below. The proposal \nwould also revise \u00a7 226.5(a)(3) to eliminate the requirement that certain disclosures must precede other \ndisclosures, as discussed below under \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2). Similarly, \u00a7 226.5(a)(3)(iii), (iv), (vi), and (vii) would be \nrevised to impose formatting requirements comparable to those applicable to credit card and other open-end (not \nhome-secured) credit for home-equity plan account-opening disclosures (\u00a7 226.6(a)(1)), periodic statements (\u00a7 \n226.7(a)(6)), change-in-terms notices (\u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B)), and notices of application of a penalty rate (\u00a7 \n226.9(i)(4)), as discussed in this section-by-section analysis below under those disclosure provisions.\n\n5(b) Time of Disclosures\n\n5(b)(1) Account-Opening Disclosures\n\n5(b)(1)(ii) Charges Imposed as Part of an Open-End Plan\n\n\n\nIn the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted new \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(ii) to provide, for open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit, an exception to the requirement to provide account-opening disclosures before the first transaction \nunder the plan. The exception applies to charges that are imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit plan but that are not required to be disclosed in a tabular format in the account-opening disclosures under \u00a7 \n226.6(b)(2). Under \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(ii), these disclosures do not have to be provided in writing. Thus, a creditor may \ndisclose these charges orally or in writing, after account opening but before the consumer agrees to pay or \nbecomes obligated to pay for the charge, as long as the creditor discloses them at a time and in a manner such that \na consumer would be likely to notice them.\n\nAs discussed above, the Board is proposing to revise \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(ii) to apply the same exception to the written \ndisclosure requirement to HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. For the reasons discussed above under \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(ii), \nthe Board also proposes to revise \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(ii) to except the same charges from the general timing \nrequirements. These are charges that are not required to be provided in a tabular format in the account-opening \ndisclosures in a home-equity plan, and therefore would be expected to be less significant. Further, as discussed \nabove, disclosure of these charges at the time a consumer agrees to pay the charge may be more useful to the \nconsumer, because the disclosure would come at a time when the consumer would be more likely to notice the \ndisclosure.\n\nComment 5(b)(1)(ii)-1, which provides guidance on compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(ii), would be \nrevised to apply to HELOCs as well as open-end (not home-secured) plans. New comment 5(b)(1)(ii)-2 would be \nadded to explain the relationship of the provisions of \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(ii) to the restrictions on changes in terms of \nHELOCs under \u00a7 226.5b(f). The comment states that even if certain charges may be disclosed at a time later than \naccount opening, the creditor would not be permitted to impose a charge for a feature or service previously \navailable under the plan for no charge, or to increase a fee for a service previously available under the plan for a \nlower charge.\n\n5(b)(1)(iv) Membership Fees\n\nSection 226.5(b)(1)(iv)(A) provides that in general, a creditor may not collect any fee before account-opening \ndisclosures are given. However, this provision allows creditors to collect a membership fee at an earlier time, as \nlong as the consumer may, after receiving the disclosures, reject the plan and have the fee refunded. Section \n226.5(b)(1)(iv)(B) provides that this provision does not apply to HELOCs, because separate rules about collection \nand refunds of fees apply under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(g) and (h) and 226.15, which would cover membership fee \nreimbursements. Section 226.5b(g) requires that a creditor refund all fees paid if a term changes after application \nand the consumer decides not to open a HELOC account; \u00a7 226.5b(h) requires a refund of all fees upon the \nconsumer's request within three business days after receipt of the application disclosures. (Under the proposal, \u00a7 \n226.5b(g) and (h) would be redesignated \u00a7 226.5b(d) and (e), respectively.) Section 226.5(b)(1)(iv)(B) would be \nrevised by adding a cross-reference to \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(d) and (e) and 226.15, to ensure that users of the regulation are \naware that even though the fee refundability rules of \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(iv)(A) do not apply, home-equity plans are \nsubject to other rules regarding refunds of fees.\n\n5(b)(1)(v) Application Fees\n\nSection 226.5(b)(1)(v) provides that application fees excludable from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(1) are \nsubject to the same rules regarding collection and refundability as other membership fees under \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(iv). \nTo clarify that HELOCs are not subject to these rules, but instead are subject to the separate rules about collection \nand refunds of fees under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(d) and (e) and 226.15, \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(v) would be redesignated \u00a7 \n226.5(b)(1)(v)(A), and a new \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(v)(B) would be added, parallel to \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(iv)(B).\n\n5(b)(2) Periodic Statements\n\nParagraph 5(b)(2)(ii)\n\n\n\nSection 226.5(b)(2)(ii) requires that the creditor mail or deliver a periodic statement at least 14 days before the end \nof any period allowing the consumer to pay to avoid the imposition of finance or other charges. Section 106(b) of \nthe 2009 Credit Card Act (cited above), amends TILA Section 163 (15 U.S.C. 1666b) to require that the period \nbetween the mailing of the statement and the due date to avoid finance or other charges must be at least 21 days. \nOn July 15, 2009, the Board published an interim final rule amending \u00a7 226.5(b)(2)(ii) to implement this provision of \nthe Credit Card Act, which under the legislation becomes effective 90 days after enactment. Accordingly, no \nproposed amendments to \u00a7 226.5(b)(2)(ii) are in this proposal. When this proposal is adopted into a final rule, \u00a7 \n226.5(b)(2)(ii) will reflect the amendments made to implement the Credit Card Act.\n\n5(b)(4) Home-Equity Plan Application and Three Days After Application Disclosures\n\nSection 226.5(b)(4) states that the disclosures required at the time of an application for a home-equity plan must be \nprovided in accordance with the timing requirements of \u00a7 226.5b. As discussed under \u00a7 226.5b below, the Board is \nproposing to change the timing requirements for home-equity plan disclosures; some disclosures would be required \nat the time of application, and additional disclosures would be required three business days after application. \nAccordingly, \u00a7 226.5(b)(4) would be revised to reflect the new timing requirements for the disclosures under \u00a7 \n226.5b, and to correct the cross-reference to the applicable paragraphs in that section. See the discussion of the \nproposed changes in the disclosure timing requirements under \u00a7 226.5b below.\n\nSection 226.5b Requirements for Home-Equity Plans\n\nSummary of Proposed Disclosure Requirements\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b, which implements TILA Section 127A, generally requires creditors to provide to the consumer two \ntypes of disclosures at the time an application for a HELOC is provided: \"application disclosures\" and a home-equity \nbrochure published by the Board (the \"HELOC brochure\"). 15 U.S.C. 1637a. The application disclosures and \nHELOC brochure provide information about the creditor's HELOC plans and how HELOCs work; neither contains \ntransaction-specific information about the terms of the HELOC offered by a creditor to a consumer, such as the \ncredit limit or APR.\n\nApplication disclosures. The application disclosures that a creditor generally must provide to a consumer on or with \nan application for a HELOC plan must contain details about the creditor's HELOC plan, including the length of the \ndraw and repayment periods, how the minimum required payment is calculated, whether a balloon payment will be \nowed if a consumer only makes minimum required payments, payment examples, and what fees are charged by \nthe creditor to open, use, or maintain the plan. Again, they do not include information that is dependent on the value \nof the dwelling or a borrower's creditworthiness, such as a credit limit or the APRs offered to the consumer, \nbecause the application disclosures are provided before underwriting takes place.\n\nThe Board proposes to replace the application disclosures with transaction-specific HELOC disclosures (\"early \nHELOC disclosures\") that must be given within three business days after application (but no later than account \nopening). Under the proposal, the information required to be disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures would differ \nfrom the information required to be disclosed as part of the current application disclosures. For example, the Board \nproposes to require creditors to include several additional disclosures in the early HELOC disclosures that are not \ncurrently required to be disclosed as part of the application disclosures, such as the credit limit and the APRs being \noffered to the consumer. In addition, the Board proposes not to require creditors to provide certain disclosures in \nthe early HELOC disclosures that are currently required to be disclosed as part of the application disclosures. For \nexample, creditors generally would not be required to disclose as part of the early HELOC disclosures certain \ninformation related to variable rates currently required in the application disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12), such as \nthe historical payment example table.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the Board proposes to revise the disclosure requirements for other information currently required to be \ndisclosed in the application disclosures and included in the proposed early HELOC disclosures. For example, the \napplication disclosures currently must include several payment examples based on a $ 10,000 outstanding balance. \nUnder the proposal, the Board would require payment examples in the early HELOC disclosures, but would revise \nthe payment examples to assume the consumer borrowed the full credit line offered to the consumer (as disclosed \nin the early HELOC disclosures) at the beginning of the draw period and drew no additional advances.\n\nMoreover, the Board proposes stricter format requirements for the proposed early HELOC disclosures than \ncurrently are required for the application disclosures. Currently, the application disclosures may be provided in a \nnarrative form, as shown in the current model forms for the application disclosures (see current Home-equity \nSamples G-14A and G-14B of Appendix G). Under the proposal, the early HELOC disclosures generally must be \nprovided in the form of a table with headings, content, and format substantially similar to any of the applicable \ntables found in proposed G-14 in Appendix G.\n\nHELOC brochure. Currently, a creditor is required to provide to a consumer the HELOC brochure or a suitable \nsubstitute at the time an application for a HELOC is provided to the consumer. The HELOC brochure is around 20 \npages long and provides general information about HELOCs and how they work, as well as a glossary of relevant \nterms and a description of various features that can apply to HELOCs. The Board proposes to eliminate the \nrequirement for creditors to provide to consumers the HELOC brochure with applications for HELOCs. Instead, the \nBoard proposes to require that a creditor must provide a new document published by the Board entitled, \"Key \nQuestions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit\" (the \"Key Questions\" document) to a consumer when a \nHELOC application is given to the consumer. This \"Key Questions\" document would be a one-page document that \nis designed to contain simple, straightforward and concise information about HELOCs, including potentially risky \nfeatures.\n\nCurrent Comments 5b-2 and 5b-3\n\nCurrent comments 5b-2 and 5b-3 provide transaction rules that were included in the commentary when \u00a7 226.5b \nwas added to Regulation Z in 1989. Specifically current 5b-2 provides that the notice rules of \u00a7 226.9(c) apply if, by \nwritten agreement under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a HELOC plan entered into on or after \nNovember 7, 1989 at or before the plan's scheduled expiration (for example, by renewing the plan on different \nterms). A new plan results, however, if the plan is renewed (with or without changes to the terms) after the \nscheduled expiration. The new plan is subject to all open-end credit rules, including \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b, 226.6, and 226.15.\n\nThe Board proposes a technical revision to this comment to delete the reference to November 7, 1989, as obsolete. \nThus, this proposed comment provides that the notice rules of \u00a7 226.9(c) applies if, by written agreement under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a HELOC plan at or before its scheduled expiration (for example, by \nrenewing the plan on different terms). A new plan would result, however, if the plan is renewed (with or without \nchanges to the terms) after the scheduled expiration. The new plan would be subject to all open-end credit rules, \nincluding \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b, 226.6, and 226.15.\n\nCurrent comment 5b-3 provides that the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b do not apply to HELOC plans entered into before \nNovember 7, 1989. The requirements of \u00a7 226.5b also do not apply if the original consumer, on or after November \n7, 1989, renews a plan entered into prior to that date (with or without changes to the terms). If, on or after \nNovember 7, 1989, a security interest in the consumer's dwelling is added to a line of credit entered into before that \ndate, the substantive restrictions of \u00a7 226.5b apply for the remainder of the plan, but no new disclosures are \nrequired under \u00a7 226.5b. The Board proposes to delete this comment as obsolete.\n\n5b(a) Home-Equity Document Provided on or With the Application\n\n5b(a)(1) General\n\n\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(b) and (e), which implement TILA Section 127A(b)(1)(A) and (e), require a creditor to provide the \nHELOC brochure published by the Board, or a suitable substitute, to a consumer when a HELOC application is \ngiven to the consumer. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(b)(1)(A) and (e). Pursuant to Section 4 of the Home Equity Loan Act cited \nearlier, the Board's HELOC brochure must contain (1) a general description of HELOC plans and the terms and \nconditions on which such plans are generally extended; and (2) a discussion of the potential advantages and \ndisadvantages of such plans. As discussed above, the current HELOC brochure is around 20 pages long and \nprovides general information about HELOCs and how they work, as well as a glossary of relevant terms, and a \ndescription of various features that can apply to HELOCs.\n\n\"Key Questions\" document. The Board proposes to eliminate the requirement in current \u00a7 226.5b(b) and (e) for \ncreditors to provide to consumers the HELOC brochure on or with applications for HELOCs. Instead, the Board \nproposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) to require a creditor to provide a new document published by the Board entitled \n\"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit\" (the \"Key Questions\" document) to a consumer when a \nHELOC application is given to the consumer. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section \n105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which \ninclude facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of \ncredit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). TILA also gives the Board authority to require a brochure with content \n\"substantially similar\" to that required in Section 4 of the Home Equity Loan Act. 15 U.S.C. 1637(e)(2). In consumer \ntesting conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board asked participants to review the HELOC \nbrochure, and indicate whether the brochure provides useful information and whether they would be likely to read \nthe brochure if it were given to them with a HELOC application. In this consumer testing, some participants found \nthe HELOC brochure useful, particularly if they had little experience with HELOCs or home-equity products in \ngeneral. However, a significant number of participants indicated that the HELOC brochure is too long, and, as a \nresult, they would be unlikely to read it. In the consumer testing, most participants had obtained a HELOC in the \npast, but none of the participants recalled reading the HELOC brochure when they applied for a HELOC. Some \nparticipants recommended that a shorter, more concise version of the HELOC brochure would be more useful and \neasier to read and comprehend.\n\nIn many respects, the \"Key Questions\" document (included in this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION as \nAttachment A) satisfies the statutory requirements for the HELOC brochure, which, as noted, must include a \ngeneral description of HELOC plans and the terms and conditions on which such plans are generally extended; and \na discussion of the potential advantages and disadvantages of such plans. This one-page document would inform \nconsumers about certain HELOC terms that are important for consumers to consider when selecting a home-equity \nproduct, including potentially risky features such as variable rates and balloon payments. As shown in Attachment \nA, the \"Key Questions\" document would contain answers to the following questions: \"Can my interest rate \nincrease?,\" \"Can my minimum payment increase?,\" \"When can I borrow money?,\" \"How soon do I have to pay off \nmy balance?,\" \"Will I owe a balloon payment?\", \"Do I have to pay any fees?,\" and \"Should I get a home equity loan \ninstead of a line of credit?\" The \"Key Questions\" document also would provide a link to the Board's Web site for \nfurther information, which currently contains an electronic version of the HELOC brochure. The \"Key Questions\" \ndocument was designed based on consumers' preference for a question-and-answer tabular format, and refined in \nseveral rounds of consumer testing. In the consumer testing, the \"Key Questions\" document tested well with \nparticipants: all indicated that they would find it useful, most found it very clear and easy to read, and the majority \nindicated that they would read a one-page disclosure, such as the \"Key Questions\" document, when considering a \nHELOC.\n\nAs a result, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) requires a creditor to provide the Board's \"Key Questions\" document to a \nconsumer at the time an application is provided to the consumer. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) requires creditors to \nprovide this document \"as published.\" Proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-9 clarifies that a creditor may not revise the \"Key \nQuestions\" document. The Board believes that requiring creditors to provide the \"Key Questions\" document without \nrevision would benefit consumers. Consumers would receive consistent information about certain HELOC terms \nthat are important to consider when selecting a home-equity product; this information would be provided in a \nquestion-and-answer format using language proven to be useful to consumers through consumer testing.\n\n\n\nHELOC applications contained in magazines or other publications, or when the application is received by telephone \nor through an intermediary agent or broker. Under footnote 10a, which implements TILA Section 127A(b)(1)(A), the \napplication disclosures and HELOC brochure may be delivered or placed in the mail not later than three business \ndays following receipt of a consumer's application that was in a magazine or other publication, or when the \napplication is received by telephone or through an intermediary agent or broker. 15 U.S.C.\n\n1637a(b)(1)(A). Current comment 5b(b)-6 provides a cross reference to comment 19(b)-3 for guidance on \ndetermining whether or not an application involves an \"intermediary agent or broker.\" Current comment 19(b)-3 \nprovides that an example of an \"intermediary agent or broker\" is a broker who (1) customarily within a brief time \nafter receiving an application inquires about the credit terms of several creditors with whom the broker does \nbusiness and submits the application to one of them; and (2) is responsible for only a small percentage of the \napplications received by that creditor. During the time the broker has the application, the broker might request a \ncredit report and an appraisal (or even prepare an entire loan package if customary in that particular area). (In the \nproposal issued by the Board on closed-end mortgages published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the \nBoard proposes to move current comment 19(b)-3 to proposed comment 19(d)(3)-3.)\n\nThe Board proposes to revise and move the contents of footnote 10a related to telephone applications and \napplications received through intermediary agents and brokers to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1)(ii). Specifically, proposed \n\u00a7 226.5b(a)(1)(ii) provides that for telephone applications and applications received through an intermediary agent \nor broker, the \"Key Questions\" document must be delivered or mailed within three business days following receipt \nof a consumer's application by the creditor (but no later than account opening). In these cases, the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument must be provided along with the early HELOC disclosures (which are discussed in more detail in the \nsection-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1)). In addition, current comment 5b(b)-6 (that provides a cross \nreference to current comment 19(b)-3 for guidance on determining whether an application involves an \"intermediary \nagent or broker\") would be moved to proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-7 with technical revisions. The Board also \nproposes to add new comment 5b(a)(1)-8 to cross reference the definition of \"business day\" contained in \u00a7 \n226.2(a)(6).\n\nThe Board proposes, however, to delete the contents of footnote 10a related to applications contained in \nmagazines or other publications. Specifically, current footnote 10a permits a creditor not to provide application \ndisclosures and the HELOC brochure with applications that a creditor makes available to consumers in magazine or \nother publications. Instead, the creditor may provide these disclosures within three business days following receipt \nof a consumer's application. The rationale for this approach was that requiring a creditor to provide the application \ndisclosures and HELOC brochure with applications available to consumers in magazines or other publications \nwould overly burden creditors because these disclosures would take up many pages in a magazine or other \npublication.\n\nNonetheless, the Board proposes under new \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) to require a creditor to provide the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument with applications that the creditor makes available to consumers in magazines or other publications, \nrather than providing the pamphlet within three days of application as required by TILA 127A(b)(1)(A). 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(b)(1)(A). The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments \nand exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating \nconsumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 \nU.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Unlike the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure that could take up multiple \npages in a magazine or other publication, the \"Key Questions\" document would be one page. Thus, the Board \nbelieves that requiring the \"Key Questions\" document to be disclosed with applications in magazines or other \npublications would not place undue burdens on creditors. In addition, requiring the \"Key Questions\" document to be \ngiven with applications in magazines or other publications would benefit consumers by providing with the \napplication, information about HELOC terms that are important for consumers to consider when selecting a home-\nequity product. The Board solicits comments on this approach.\n\nMail applications. Current comment 5b(b)-1 provides that if a creditor sends an application through the mail, the \napplication disclosures and the HELOC brochure must accompany the application. In addition, as discussed above, \n\n\n\nif an application is taken over the telephone, the application disclosures and HELOC brochure may be delivered or \nmailed within three business days of taking the application. If an application is mailed to the consumer following a \ntelephone request, however, the creditor also must send the application disclosures and a HELOC brochure along \nwith the application. The Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-1 and to apply this \ncomment to disclosure of the \"Key Questions\" document.\nSpecifically, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-1 provides that if the creditor sends an application through the mail, the \n\"Key Questions\" document must accompany the application. In addition, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-1 provides \nthat if an application is taken over the telephone, the \"Key Questions\" document must be delivered or mailed within \nthree business days of taking the application (but not later than account opening). If an application is mailed to the \nconsumer following a telephone request, however, the creditor would be required to send the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument along with the application.\n\nGeneral purpose applications. Current comment 5b(b)-2 provides that the application disclosures and the HELOC \nbrochure need not be provided when a general purpose application is given to a consumer unless (1) the \napplication or materials accompanying it indicate that it can be used to apply for a HELOC plan, or (2) the \napplication is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry about a HELOC plan. If a general purpose \napplication is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry only about credit other than a HELOC plan, the \napplication disclosures and HELOC brochure need not be provided even if the application indicates it can be used \nfor a HELOC plan, unless it is accompanied by promotional information about HELOC plans.\n\nThe Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-2 and to apply this comment to \ndisclosure of the \"Key Questions\" document. Specifically, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-2 provides that the \"Key \nQuestions\" document need not be provided when a general purpose application is given to a consumer unless (1) \nthe application or materials accompanying it indicate that it can be used to apply for a HELOC plan or (2) the \napplication is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry about a HELOC plan. Proposed comment \n5b(a)(1)-2 also provides that if a general purpose application is provided in response to a consumer's specific \ninquiry only about credit other than a HELOC plan, the \"Key Questions\" document need not be provided even if the \napplication indicates it can be used for a HELOC, unless it is accompanied by promotional information about \nHELOC plans.\n\nPublicly-available applications. Current comment 5b(b)-3 addresses applications for HELOCs that are available \nwithout the need for a consumer to request them, such as so-called \"take-one forms\". This comment provides that \nthese applications must be accompanied by the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure, such as by \nattaching the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure to the application form. The Board proposes to move \nthis comment to proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-3 and to apply this comment to disclosure of the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument. Specifically, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-3 provides that a creditor must include the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument with applications that are available without the need for a consumer to request them, such as take-ones, \nand that a creditor may provide this document by attaching it to the application.\n\nResponse cards. Current comment 5b(b)-4 states that sometimes a creditor may solicit consumers for its HELOC \nplan by mailing a response card which the consumer returns to the creditor to indicate interest in the plan. If the \nonly action taken by the creditor upon receipt of the response card is to send the consumer an application form or to \ntelephone the consumer to discuss the plan, the creditor need not send the application disclosures and the HELOC \nbrochure with the response card. The Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-4 and \nto apply this comment to disclosure of the \"Key Questions\" document.\nSpecifically, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-4 provides that a creditor is not required to send the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument with a response card if the only action taken by the creditor upon receipt of the response card is to send \nthe consumer an application form or to telephone the consumer to discuss the plan. If the creditor sends the \nconsumer an application form in response to receiving a response card, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-1 provides \nthat a creditor must provide the \"Key Questions\" document with the application form. In addition, if a creditor calls \nthe consumer in response to receiving a response card and an application is taken over the phone, proposed \ncomment 5b(a)(1)-1 provides that the \"Key Questions\" document must be delivered or mailed within three business \ndays of taking the application (but not later than account opening).\n\n\n\nDenial or withdrawal of application. Current comment 5b(b)-5 provides that in situations where current footnote 10a \npermits the creditor a three-day delay in providing application disclosures and the HELOC brochure, if the creditor \ndetermines within that period that an application will not be approved, the creditor need not provide the consumer \nwith the application disclosures or HELOC brochure. Similarly, if the consumer withdraws the application within this \nthree-day period, the creditor need not provide the application disclosures or the HELOC brochure. The Board \nproposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-5 and to apply this comment to the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument. Specifically, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-5 provides that in situations where proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1)(ii) \nallows a creditor to delay providing the \"Key Questions\" document until three business days following receipt of a \nconsumer's application--namely, for telephone applications and applications received through an intermediary agent \nor broker--if the creditor determines within that three-day period that an application will not be approved, the creditor \nwould not need to provide the \"Key Questions\" document. Similarly, under this proposed comment, if a consumer \nwithdraws the application within this three-day period, the creditor would not need to provide the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument.\n\nProminent location. Current \u00a7 226.5b provides that the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure must be \nprovided on or with the application. See current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), (b) and (e). Current comment 5b(a)(1)-5 contains \nguidance on providing the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure on or with a blank application that is \nmade available to the consumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web site. Current comment \n5a(a)(1)-5 provides creditors with flexibility in satisfying the requirement to provide the application disclosures and \nthe HELOC brochure on or with a blank application that is made available to the consumer in electronic form. \nMethods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are not limited to, the following examples. First, \nthe application disclosures and HELOC brochure could automatically appear on the screen when the application \nappears. Second, the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure could be located on the same Web page as \nthe application (whether or not they appear on the initial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous \nreference to the location of the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure and indicates that the application \ndisclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable. Third, creditors could provide a link to the \nelectronic application disclosures and HELOC brochure on or with the application as long as consumers cannot \nbypass the application disclosures and HELOC brochure before submitting the application. The link would take the \nconsumer to the application disclosures and HELOC brochure, but the consumer need not be required to scroll \ncompletely through the application disclosures or HELOC brochure. Fourth, the application disclosures and HELOC \nbrochure could be located on the same Web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the initial \nscreen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application. Whatever method is \nused, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the application disclosures and HELOC brochure.\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), creditors would be required to provide the \"Key Questions\" document in a \nprominent location on or with the application. Proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-6 provides guidance to creditors for how \nto comply with the prominent location requirement when the document is given in either paper or electronic form. \nProposed comment 5b(a)(1)-6.i provides that when the \"Key Questions\" document is provided in paper form, the \ndocument is prominently located, for example, if the document is on the same page as an application. If the \ndocument appears elsewhere, it is deemed to be prominently located if the application contains a clear and \nconspicuous reference to the location of the document and indicates that the document provides information about \nHELOCs.\n\nWith respect to disclosure of the \"Key Questions\" document in electronic form, the Board proposes to move current \ncomment 5b(a)(1)-5, which provides guidance on providing the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure on \nor with a blank application that is made available to the consumer in electronic form, to proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-\n6.ii and to apply this guidance to the \"Key Questions\" document. In particular, proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-6.ii \nprovides that generally, creditors must provide the \"Key Questions\" document in a prominent location on or with a \nblank application that is made available to the consumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web \nsite. Creditors would have flexibility in satisfying this requirement. Under proposed comment 5b(a)(1)-6, methods \ncreditors could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are not limited to, the following examples. First, the \"Key \nQuestions\" document could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears. Second, the \"Key \nQuestions\" document could be located on the same Web page as the application (whether or not they appear on \n\n\n\nthe initial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the document and \nindicates the document includes information about HELOCs. Third, creditors could provide a link to the electronic \n\"Key Questions\" document on or with the application as long as consumers cannot bypass the document before \nsubmitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the document, but the consumer need not be \nrequired to scroll completely through the document. Fourth, the \"Key Questions\" document could be located on the \nsame Web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the initial screen, immediately preceding the \nbutton that the consumer will click to submit the application. Whatever method is used, a creditor would not need to \nconfirm that the consumer has read the \"Key Questions\" document.\n\n5b(a)(2) Electronic Disclosures\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(a)(3) provides that for an application accessed by the consumer in electronic form, the application \ndisclosures and HELOC brochure may be provided to the consumer in electronic form on or with the application. \nCurrent comment 5b(a)(3)-1 provides guidance on when the application disclosures and HELOC brochure must be \nin electronic form. Specifically, current comment 5b(a)(3)-1 provides that if a consumer accesses a HELOC \napplication electronically (other than as described below), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must \nprovide the application disclosures and HELOC brochure in electronic form (such as with the application form on its \nWeb site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If \nthe creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the consumer, this requirement would not be met. In contrast, if a \nconsumer is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a HELOC application electronically, such as \nvia a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third \nparty that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the creditor may provide the \napplication disclosures and HELOC brochure in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with \nthe timing, delivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.\n\nThe Board proposes to move current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(3) and current comment 5b(a)(3)-1 to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2) \nand proposed comment 5b(a)(2)-1, respectively, and to apply these provisions to the \"Key Questions\" document. \nSpecifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2) provides that for an application accessed by the consumer in electronic form, \nthe \"Key Questions\" document may be provided to the consumer in electronic form on or with the application. In \naddition, proposed comment 5b(a)(2)-1 provides guidance on when the \"Key Questions\" document must be in \nelectronic form. Specifically, proposed comment 5b(a)(2)-1 provides that if a consumer accesses a HELOC \napplication electronically (other than as described below), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must \nprovide the \"Key Questions\" document in electronic form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order \nto meet the requirement to provide the document in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor \ninstead mailed the \"Key Questions\" document in paper form to the consumer, the requirement that the \"Key \nQuestions\" document be provided on or with the application would not be met. In contrast, if a consumer is \nphysically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a HELOC application electronically, such as via a terminal \nor kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has \narranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the creditor may provide the \"Key Questions\" \ndocument in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery, and \nretainability requirements of the regulation.\n\n5b(a)(3) Duties of Third Parties\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(c), which implements TILA Section 127A(c), provides that persons other than the creditor who \nprovide applications to consumers for HELOC plans generally must provide the HELOC brochure at the time an \napplication is provided. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(c). If such persons have the application disclosures for a creditor's HELOC \nplan, they also must provide the disclosures at the time an application is provided. Current comment 5b(c)-1 \nclarifies that although third parties who give applications to consumers for HELOC plans must provide the HELOC \nbrochure in all cases, such persons are required to provide the application disclosures only in certain instances. A \nthird party has no duty to obtain application disclosures about a creditor's HELOC plan or to create a set of \ndisclosures based on what it knows about a creditor's plan. If, however, a creditor provides the third party with \n\n\n\napplication disclosures along with its application form, the third party must give the disclosures to the consumer with \nthe application form. Current comment 5b(c)-1 also provides that the duties under current \u00a7 226.5b(c) are those of \nthe third party; the creditor is not responsible for ensuring that a third party complies with those obligations. Current \ncomment 5b(c)-1 further provides that if an intermediary agent or broker takes an application over the telephone or \nreceives an application contained in a magazine or other publication, current footnote 10a permits that person to \nmail the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure within three business days of receipt of the application. In \naddition, current comment 5b(e)-2 provides that if a creditor determines that third party has provided a consumer \nwith the required HELOC brochure, the creditor need not give the consumer a second brochure.\n\nThe Board proposes to delete current \u00a7 226.5b(c) and current 5b(c)-1 as obsolete. As discussed above and in more \ndetail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1), the Board proposes to delete the requirement \nthat the application disclosures and HELOC brochure be provided on or with an application for a HELOC plan. \nRegarding obligations on third parties to provide disclosures on or with HELOC applications, the Board proposes in \nnew \u00a7 226.5b(a)(3) to require persons other than the creditor who provide applications to consumers for HELOC \nplans to, provide the \"Key Questions\" document on or with HELOC applications (except for telephone applications, \ndiscussed below). This proposed requirement on third parties generally to provide the \"Key Questions\" document \non or with HELOC applications is consistent with the requirement in current \u00a7 226.5b(c) that third parties must \nprovide the HELOC brochure on or with HELOC applications.\n\nNonetheless, unlike current \u00a7 226.5b(c), which does not require a third party to provide the HELOC brochure with \napplications the third party makes available in magazines and other publications, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(3) requires \nthird parties to provide the \"Key Questions\" document with these HELOC applications. As discussed above \nregarding a creditor's duty to provide the \"Key Questions\" document with HELOC applications in magazines or \nother publications, the Board believes that requiring the \"Key Questions\" document to be disclosed with applications \nin magazines or other publications would not place undue burdens on third parties because the \"Key Questions- \ndocument is a single page. In addition, requiring the \"Key Questions\" document to be given with applications in \nmagazines or other publications would benefit consumers by providing with the application information about \nHELOC terms that are important for consumers to consider when selecting a home-equity product. The Board \nsolicits comments on this approach.\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(3), third parties would not be required to provide the \"Key Questions\" document with \nrespect to telephone applications. Proposed comment 5b(a)(3)-3 clarifies that for telephone applications taken by a \nthird party, the creditor would have the duty to provide the \"Key Questions\" document within three days following \nreceipt of the consumer's application by the creditor (but not later than account opening). The Board believes that \nimposing a separate duty on a third party to provide the \"Key Questions\" document for telephone applications is \nunnecessary, because the creditor would be required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) to provide the \"Key \nQuestions\" document and the early HELOC disclosures (as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section \nanalysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1)) within three days after the application has been received by the creditor (but \nnot later than account opening).\n\nProposed comment 5b(a)(3)-1 provides that the duties to provide the \"Key Questions\" document under proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(a)(3) are those of the third party; the creditor would not responsible for ensuring that a third party complies \nwith those obligations. This proposed comment is consistent with current guidance in current comment 5b(c)-1. \nProposed comment 5b(a)(3)-2 provides that if a creditor determines that a third party has provided a consumer with \nthe \"Key Questions\" document, the creditor need not give the consumer a second copy of the document. This \nproposed comment is consistent with current guidance in comment 5b(e)-2 regarding disclosure of the HELOC \nbrochure.\n\n5b(b) Home-Equity Disclosures Provided No Later Than Account-Opening or Three Business Days After \nApplication, Whichever Is Earlier\n\n5b(b)(1) Timing\n\n\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(b), which implements TILA Section 127A(b)(1)(A), generally requires creditors to provide to the \nconsumer two types of disclosures at the time an application for a HELOC is provided: Application disclosures and \nthe HELOC brochure. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(b)(1)(A). The Board proposes to delete current \u00a7 226.5b(b). As discussed in \nmore detail above in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a), the Board proposes no longer to \nrequire creditors to disclose the HELOC brochure to consumers on or with HELOC applications. In addition, as \ndiscussed below, the Board proposes to replace the application disclosures with transaction-specific HELOC \ndisclosures (the \"early HELOC disclosures\") that must be given within three business days after application (but no \nlater than account opening). See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1).\n\nThe application disclosures that a creditor generally must provide to a consumer on or with an application for a \nHELOC plan must contain details about the creditor's HELOC plan, including the length of the draw and repayment \nperiods, how the minimum required payment is calculated, whether a balloon payment will be owed if a consumer \nonly makes minimum required payments, payment examples, and what fees are charged by the creditor to open, \nuse, or maintain the plan. The application disclosures do not include information dependent on the value of the \ndwelling or a borrower's creditworthiness, such as a credit limit or the APRs offered to the consumer, because the \napplication disclosures are provided before underwriting takes place.\n\nIn the proposed rule implementing the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008 (contained in Sections 2501-\n2503 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-289, enacted on July 30, 2008, as amended \nby the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-343, enacted on October 3, 2008) (MDIA), the \nBoard solicited comment on the timing of HELOC disclosures. 73 FR 74989 (December 10, 2008). MDIA, which \napplies only to closed-end mortgage transactions, requires that early mortgage disclosures be provided no later \nthan three business days after application and seven business days before consummation of the loan. The Board \nnoted that the timing of HELOC application disclosures is not affected by MDIA, but solicited comment on whether it \nwould be necessary or appropriate to change the timing of the HELOC application disclosures and, if so, what \nchanges should be made. The Board asked whether transaction-specific disclosures (such as the APR, an \nitemization of fees, and potential payment amounts) should be required after application and earlier than account \nopening, at least in some circumstances. The Board noted that many consumers take a major draw on the account \nimmediately upon opening it, to fund a home purchase, for example, or pay for an immediate large expense such as \na college tuition bill. The Board asked commenters to address whether a requirement to disclose the final HELOC \nterms, including the APR and fees, three days before account opening would substantially benefit consumers who \nplan to take a draw immediately. The Board also requested comment on whether the potential costs of such a \nrequirement would outweigh the potential benefits.\n\nFinancial institution commenters opposed requiring disclosures based on the amount of an initial draw on the line of \ncredit to be given in advance of account opening. Commenters contended that it would be impracticable to provide \ndisclosures based on the amount of an initial draw, because the creditor, at the time disclosures would be required, \nwould have no way of knowing the amount of the draw, or even whether the consumer planned to take a draw \nimmediately upon account opening. Commenters argued that it would be difficult for creditors to discern the \nconsumer's intent prior to account opening. The consumer might not have plans at the time of the disclosures \nregarding the initial draw; thus, even if the creditor asked the consumer, the creditor might still be unable to obtain \nthis information. Commenters also contended that consumers might need funds soon and that in such cases the \nenforced three-day waiting period would be more disadvantageous than beneficial to consumers.\n\nAnother commenter discussed the possibility of two separate timing requirements--one for cases in which the \namount of the initial draw is known, and another in which this amount is not known--but argued that such a rule \nwould be difficult for creditors to manage correctly. Other commenters argued generally that existing disclosures \nprovide adequate information for consumers and that imposing the suggested timing requirement would impose \nundue burdens and costs on creditors.\n\nConsumer group commenters argued that HELOCs are widely used by creditors in place of closed-end second \nmortgages, and that some creditors use HELOCs for first mortgages as well, to avoid having to provide closed-end \nTILA disclosures. Accordingly, these commenters argued that HELOC creditors should be required to disclose the \n\n\n\nexpected total of payments, finance charge, and payment schedule. One consumer group commenter stated that \nthe differences in content and timing between closed-end mortgage disclosures and HELOC disclosures makes it \ndifficult for consumers effectively to comparison shop between these two types of credit, and thus difficult to make \nmeaningful choices. The commenter also argued that since creditors must revise their systems to comply with \nMDIA for closed-end mortgage loans, complying with the same rules for HELOCs would cause little additional \nexpense.\n\nThe Board believes that providing disclosures that would be transaction-specific, based on the amount of an initial \ndraw, or on expected amounts of draws and payments over the life of the plan, would not be practicable. In \naddition, the Board believes that requiring the account-opening HELOC disclosures to be provided some period, \nsuch as three or seven business days, in advance of account opening could unnecessarily delay the process of \nopening a HELOC in some cases and thus could disadvantage some consumers. 13 \n\nThe Board nevertheless believes that consumers could benefit from receiving early HELOC disclosures that are \nmore transaction-specific than the application disclosures provided under the current regulation. Therefore, the \nproposal provides for early HELOC disclosures to be given within three business days after application or no later \nthan account opening, whichever is earlier. The Board anticipates that in most cases account opening will not occur \nprior to three business days after application, and the early HELOC disclosures will be given at least some days in \nadvance of account opening. Further, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c), the proposal requires early HELOC disclosures to be based on (1) the actual APR for which the \nconsumer qualifies (unlike the application disclosures, which do not include a consumer-specific APR) and (2) the \namount of the credit limit for which the consumer likely qualifies (unlike the current application disclosures, which \ninclude disclosures based on a hypothetical draw of $ 10,000). The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its \nauthority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the \nstatute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers \navoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The Board believes that to assure a meaningful \ndisclosure of the credit terms of a HELOC, so that consumers can fully understand the terms offered on the \nHELOC, it is necessary and proper to adjust the timing of the HELOC disclosures from at-application to within three \nbusiness days after application (but no later than account opening).\n\nConsumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures supports this proposed approach. In the first two \nrounds of testing, some participants reviewing a disclosure based on the current requirements for the application \ndisclosures either tried to find an interest rate applicable to their plan and were surprised to learn that such a rate is \nnot contained in the disclosure, or incorrectly assumed that one of the rates shown in the disclosure (which are \nhypothetical, not actual, rates) was the rate that was being offered to them. In subsequent testing of a disclosure \nform with more transaction-specific information (including the APR and credit limit for which the consumer qualified), \nparticipants indicated they would prefer to receive a transaction-specific disclosure, as opposed to a more generic \ndisclosure at application (such as the one provided under the current regulation), even if this choice meant that the \nconsumer would not receive any disclosure of HELOC plan terms at the time of application.\n\nParticipants indicated that the APR and the credit limit offered on a HELOC plan are two of the most important \npieces of information that they want to know in deciding whether to open a HELOC. The participants said that they \nwould still prefer to receive transaction-specific disclosures soon after application rather than generic disclosures at \napplication even if they were required to pay an application fee before receiving the later, more transaction-specific \n\n13 An American Bankers Association (ABA) survey reported that the average business days between application and closing for \nHELOCs and home equity loans ranged from 8 days for larger institutions to 10 days for smaller institutions. American Bankers \nAss'n, \"ABA Home Equity Lending Survey Report\" (2005), pp. 18 and 71.\n\n \n\n\n\ndisclosure. 14 These findings are consistent with the findings in the Board's testing of closed-end mortgage \ndisclosures, as discussed in the proposal issued by the Board on closed-end mortgages published elsewhere in \ntoday's Federal Register.\n\nThe proposal regarding the early HELOC disclosures is also supported by the legislative history of the Home Equity \nLoan Act. The chief sponsor of the Act, Representative David Price, explained that the disclosure provisions of the \nbill (H.R. 3011) were enacted to address concerns about the then-current law on HELOC disclosures, under which \n\"a consumer may never be advised about the essential features of his or her home-equity loan until it's time to sign \nthe full agreement.\" 15 It appears that the intent of the legislation was to provide the consumer information about the \nconsumer's particular HELOC, based on the belief that transaction-specific information could be given at the time of \napplication. Because transaction-specific information is not available until after application, the Board believes that \nthe proposed approach of requiring disclosures to contain more transaction-specific information, and to be given \nwithin three business days after application, is in accord with the congressional intent.\n\nThe Board notes that delaying the early HELOC disclosures until three days after application would not result in \nadded cost to a consumer, because as noted above, and as further discussed in the section-by-section analysis to \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(d) and (e), the consumer has the right to a refund of any fees paid in connection with the \nHELOC for three business days after the consumer receives the disclosures. In addition, if the disclosed terms \nchange after the early HELOC disclosures are provided but before the plan is opened, the consumer has the right \nto a refund of any fees at any time before account opening.\n\nSubstitution of account-opening disclosures for early HELOC disclosures. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1) provides that \nthe early HELOC disclosures must be provided within three business days after application, but no later than \naccount opening. Account opening might be unlikely to occur sooner than three business days after application, but \nthis situation could arise. In that event, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to provide both the early \nHELOC disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1) and account-opening disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.6. As \ndiscussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.6, the Board proposes that certain \naccount-opening disclosures must be disclosed in a tabular format. Under the proposal, the account-opening \nsummary table would not be identical to the table containing the early HELOC disclosures. For example, the table \ncontaining the early HELOC disclosures would show and compare two payment options offered on the HELOC \n(unless a creditor offers only one), while the account-opening summary table would show only the payment plan \nchosen by the consumer. In addition, the table containing the early HELOC disclosures contains a summary of fees, \nwhile the account-opening summary table shows fees in greater detail.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on whether, and if so in what circumstances, creditors should be permitted to substitute \nthe account-opening summary table for the table containing the early HELOC disclosures in situations where the \nearly HELOC disclosures are required to be given at the time the account is opened (because account opening \noccurs within three business days after application). For example, the regulation could provide that, because the \naccount-opening summary table shows only one HELOC payment plan, the account-opening summary table would \nbe permitted to be used in place of the early HELOC disclosures only if the creditor offers only one payment plan or \nthe consumer had already chosen a plan before account opening. The Board also requests comment on how \nfrequently account opening for HELOCs occurs within three business days after application.\n\n14 The rules regarding refundability of fees, discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(d) and (e) \nbelow, would permitconsumers to obtain a refund of such fees in some cases; however, most participants were not aware of this \nfact when they expressed their preference for the more transaction-specific disclosure.\n\n \n\n15 Remarks of Rep. Price on H.R. 3011, the Home Equity LoanConsumer Protection Act of 1988, Pub. L., 100-709, enacted on \nNov. 23, 1988, Congr. Rec., H4472 (June 20, 1988).\n\n \n\n\n\nDenial or withdrawal of application. Current footnote 10a provides that the application disclosures and HELOC \nbrochure may be delivered or placed in the mail not later than three business days following receipt of a consumer's \napplication for applications in magazines or other publications, or when the application is received by telephone or \nthrough an intermediary agent or broker. Current comment 5b(b)-5 provides that in situations where current \nfootnote 10a permits the creditor a three-day delay in providing application disclosures and the HELOC brochure, if \nthe creditor determines within that period that an application will not be approved, the creditor need not provide the \nconsumer with the application disclosures or HELOC brochure. Similarly, if the consumer withdraws the application \nwithin this three-day period, the creditor need not provide the application disclosures or the HELOC brochure.\n\nThe Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(b)(1)-1 and apply this comment to disclosure \nof the early HELOC disclosures. As discussed above, \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1) provides that creditors must deliver or mail the \nearly HELOC disclosures to a consumer not later than account opening or three business days following receipt of \na consumer's application by the creditor, whichever is earlier. The Board also proposes to add new comment \n5b(b)(1)-2 to cross reference the definition of \"business day\" contained in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6). Proposed comment \n5b(b)(1)-1 provides that if the creditor determines within this three-day period that an application will not be \napproved, the creditor would not need to provide the early HELOC disclosures. Similarly, under this proposed \ncomment, if a consumer withdraws the application within this three-day period, the creditor would not need to \nprovide the early HELOC disclosures.\n\n5b(b)(2) Form of Disclosures; Tabular Format\n\nTabular format. Current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), which implements TILA Section 127A(b)(2)(B), provides that the application \ndisclosures must be made clearly and conspicuously and generally must be grouped together and segregated from \nall unrelated information. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(b)(2)(B). Nonetheless, several application disclosures are not required to \nbe grouped together with other application disclosures. Specifically, current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), which in part \nimplements TILA Section 127A(b)(2)(D), provides that disclosures about variable rates offered on an HELOC plan \nthat are required to be disclosed as part of the application disclosures may be grouped together with the other \napplication disclosures, or may be provided separately from the other application disclosures. 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(b)(2)(D). In addition, under current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), a disclosure of conditions under which a creditor can take \ncertain actions under the plan, such as terminating the plan, described in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(iii), and an \nitemization of fees imposed by third parties to open the HELOC plan described in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(8) also may \nbe grouped together with the other application disclosures or may be disclosed separately.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(a)(1)-3 provides that while most of the application disclosures must be grouped together and \nsegregated from all unrelated information, a creditor is permitted to include with the application disclosures \ninformation that explains or expands on the required disclosures. This comment also provides guidance on what \ntypes of information explain or expand on the required disclosures.\n\nAlthough the application disclosures generally must be grouped together and segregated from all unrelated \ninformation, current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) does not require the application disclosures to be disclosed in a tabular format. \nCurrently, creditors generally provide the application disclosures in a narrative form, consistent with the current \nsample forms for the application disclosures set forth in current G-14A and G-14B of Appendix G.\n\nProposal. The Board proposes to delete current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) and current 5b(a)(1)-3. As described above, the \nBoard proposes to delete the requirement that creditors must provide the application disclosures required under \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5b. Instead, the Board proposes to require creditors to provide early HELOC disclosures within three \nbusiness days following receipt of the consumer's application by the creditor (but not later than account opening). In \naddition, the Board proposes stricter format requirements for the proposed early HELOC disclosures than currently \nare required for the application disclosures. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(i) requires that the early HELOC \ndisclosures generally must be provided in the form of a table with headings, content, and format substantially similar \nto any of the applicable tables found in proposed G-14 in Appendix G. Proposed comment 5b(b)(2)-1 clarifies that \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(i) generally requires that the headings, content and format of the tabular disclosures be \nsubstantially similar, but need not be identical, to the applicable tables in proposed G-14 to Appendix G. Under the \n\n\n\nproposal, creditors would not be allowed to include in the table information that is not specifically required or \npermitted to be disclosed in the table, as set forth in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4)(ii) through (c)(19). Creditors would be \nrequired to place certain information, such as the name and address of the borrower, directly above the table, in a \nformat substantially similar to any of the applicable tables found in proposed G-14 in Appendix G. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(b)(2)(iii). Creditors would be required to place certain information, such as a statement that the consumer is \nnot required to accept the disclosed terms, directly below the table, in a format substantially similar to any of the \napplicable tables found in proposed G-14 in Appendix G. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(iv). Creditors could include \nother information outside the table. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(v). The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its \nauthority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the \nstatute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers \navoid the uninformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The proposed requirements that the early \nHELOC disclosures must be provided in a table (or directly above or below the table) and no other information may \nbe disclosed in the table is consistent with TILA Section 127A(b)(2)(B), which generally requires the application \ndisclosures to be segregated from all unrelated information.\n\nAs discussed above, creditors typically provide the application disclosures in a narrative form, consistent with the \nmodel forms for the application disclosures set forth in current Home-equity Samples G-14A and G-14B of \nAppendix G. In the consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested application \ndisclosures in a narrative form, designed to simulate those currently in use. Participants in consumer testing found \nthis form difficult to read and understand, and their responses to follow-up questions showed that they also had \ndifficulty identifying specific information in the text. Participants who saw forms that were structured in a tabular \nformat, on the other hand, commented that the information was easier to understand and had more success \nanswering comprehension questions. These results regarding the benefit of disclosing information in a tabular \nformat are consistent with the results of research that the Board conducted on credit card disclosures in relation to \nthe January 2009 Regulation Z Rule. (See \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a(a)(2), 226.6(b)(1), 226.9(b)(3), 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(B) and \n226.9(g)(3)(iii) for certain disclosures applicable to open-end (not home-secured) credit that must be disclosed in a \ntabular format.) For these reasons, the Board proposes to require that the early HELOC disclosures generally must \nbe provided in the form of a table with headings, content, and format substantially similar to any of the applicable \ntables found in proposed G-14 in Appendix G.\n\nUnlike with current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), under the proposal, creditors would not be allowed to disclose information about \nvariable rates pursuant to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) separately from the other early HELOC disclosures. See \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(i) and (c)(10). The Board proposes to require the variable-rate information to be disclosed \nin the table with the other early HELOC disclosures. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA \nSection 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's \npurposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the \nuniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). In the consumer testing conducted by the Board on \nHELOC disclosures, participants indicated that information about the current rate on the plan (based on the current \nvalue of the index and margin) was one of the most important pieces of information that the participants wanted to \nknow as part of the early HELOC disclosures. Requiring creditors to disclose the current rate offered on the plan, \nalong with other variable-rate information, in the table, as proposed, would better ensure that consumers are aware \nof and understand those terms. As discussed above, in the consumer testing on HELOC disclosures, participants \nwere more likely to notice and understand information when it was presented in a tabular format, than when it was \npresented in a narrative form. In addition, as discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis to \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii), information about sample payments is required to be disclosed in the table, and these \nsample payments are calculated using the rates applicable to the HELOC plan. Requiring information about rates \nand certain other variable-rate information to be disclosed in the table would allow consumers to understand how \nthe sample payments relate to the rates offered on the plan.\n\nIn addition, unlike current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), the Board proposes to require that information about one-time fees \nimposed by third parties to open the HELOC plan must be disclosed in the table provided as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(i) and (c)(11). Again, participants in the consumer testing \nconducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures indicated that information about fees to open the HELOC account \n\n\n\nwas important information that they want to know as part of the early HELOC disclosures. Requiring creditors to \ndisclose information about one-time fees imposed by third parties to open the HELOC plan in the table would better \nensure that consumers are aware of these fees. In addition, as discussed in more detail below in the section-by-\nsection analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), under the proposal, creditors would be required to disclose in the \ntable one-time fees imposed by the creditor to open the HELOC plan. Requiring creditors to disclose all one-time \nfees to open the HELOC plan in the table, regardless of whether they are charged by the creditor or by a third party, \nwould enable consumers to understand better the total fees that they would be required to pay to open the HELOC \nplan. In addition, the Board believes that highlighting all one-time fees to open the HELOC plan in the table may \nfacilitate consumer shopping for HELOC plans, by helping consumers to compare easily these fees from one \nHELOC plan to another.\n\nAs discussed above, current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) provides that a disclosure of the conditions under which a creditor may \ntake certain actions under the plan, such as terminating the plan, described in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(iii) may be \ndisclosed with the application disclosures that must be segregated or disclosed separately from the segregated \napplication disclosures. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7), \nunder the proposal, a creditor would not be allowed to include in the table a disclosure of the conditions under \nwhich a creditor can take certain actions under the plan, such as terminating the plan, as described in proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(7) (although the fact that the creditor may take these actions under certain circumstances must be \ndisclosed in the table under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)). The Board believes that including a disclosure of the \nconditions in the table could lead to \"information overload\" for consumers and could distract from other information \nin the table. The conditions under which a creditor may take certain actions, such as terminating the HELOC plan, \nwill likely not change from creditor to creditor, and thus this information may not be useful to consumers in \ncomparing one HELOC plan to another. A creditor would be permitted to include this information with the early \nHELOC disclosures table, as long as it is outside the table. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(v).\n\nPrecedence of certain disclosures. Current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2), in implementing TILA Section 127A(b)(2)(C), provides \nthat the following application disclosures must precede all other required application disclosures: (1) A statement \nthat the consumer should make or otherwise retain a copy of the application disclosures; (2) a statement of the time \nby which the consumer must submit an application to obtain specific terms disclosed, an identification of any \ndisclosed term that is subject to change prior to opening the plan, and an explanation of the right to refund of all \nfees paid in connection with the application if a disclosed term changes prior to opening the plan and the consumer \ntherefore elects not to open the plan; (3) a statement that the creditor will acquire a security interest in the \nconsumer's dwelling and that loss of the dwelling may occur in the event of default; and (4) a statement that, under \ncertain conditions, the creditor may terminate the plan and require payment of the outstanding balance in full in a \nsingle payment and impose fees upon termination; prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limit; \nand, as specified in the initial agreement, implement certain changes in the plan, and a statement that the \nconsumer may receive, upon request, information about the conditions under which such actions may occur.\n\nThe Board proposes no longer to require the above statutorily required disclosures to precede other information \nprovided as part of the proposed early HELOC disclosures. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in \nTILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's \npurposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the \nuninformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). As discussed below, based on consumer testing, the \nBoard believes that this information is more effectively presented when grouped together with related information. \nAs discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c), the Board also \nproposes to delete the statement that the consumer should make or otherwise retain a copy of the disclosures \nbecause under the proposal, the early HELOC disclosures must be given in a retainable form. In addition, as \ndiscussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4), the statement of the time by \nwhich the consumer must submit an application to obtain specific terms disclosed also would be deleted as \nunnecessary because the early HELOC disclosures would be given after the application has been submitted.\n\n1. Disclosure of which terms in the table are subject to change prior to the consumer opening the plan: Under the \nproposal, a creditor would be required to disclose which terms in the table, if any, are subject to change prior to the \n\n\n\nconsumer opening the plan. Under the proposal, this information must be provided directly below the table with \nother general information that a consumer may want to consider when deciding whether to open the HELOC plan \nbeing offered (in contrast to information in the table that provides specific information about the terms being offered \non the HELOC plan). Specifically, this disclosure must be grouped with the following disclosures: (1) A disclosure \ninforming the consumer that he or she is not required to accept the terms described in the table; (2) a statement \nthat the consumer may be entitled to a refund of all fees paid if the consumer decides not to open the plan, (3) a \ncross reference to the disclosure in the table of a consumer's right to a refund of fees paid by the consumer if the \nconsumer decides not to open the HELOC plan for any reason within three business days of receiving the early \nHELOC disclosures, or any time before the plan is opened if any of the disclosed terms change (except for the \nAPR), (4) a statement that if the consumer does not understand any disclosure shown in the table in the consumer \nshould ask questions; and (5) a statement that the consumer may obtain additional information at the Web site of \nthe Board, and a reference to the Board's Web site. To help ensure that the statement about which terms in the \ntable may change prior to account opening is noticeable to consumers, the Board proposes to require that this \nstatement be disclosed in bold text, as discussed in more detail below.\n\n2. Disclosure of right to a refund of fees if terms change before account opening: Under the proposal, the \nexplanation of the right to a refund of fees if terms change before account opening and the consumer decides not to \nopen the plan would be grouped together with information about another right of a consumer to receive a refund of \nfees if the consumer notifies the creditor that he or she does not want to open the HELOC account within three \nbusiness days of receiving the early HELOC disclosures. Under the proposal, these explanations about the two \nrights to a refund of fees would be placed in the \"Fees\" section of the table. In the consumer testing conducted by \nthe Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested a version of the early HELOC disclosures where the \nexplanations of the two rights to a refund of fees were located directly above the table near the top of the early \nHELOC disclosures. The Board also tested a version of the early HELOC disclosures where the explanation was \ndisclosed in the table in the \"Fees\" section. Participants were more likely to notice and understand information \nabout the refundability of fees when it was provided in the table in the \"Fees\" section, rather than directly above the \ntable near the top of the early HELOC disclosures.\n\n3. Statement about risk of loss of home and statement about certain actions that a creditor may take with respect to \nthe plan: Under the proposal, the information about risk of loss of the home in case of default and the information \nabout certain actions that a creditor may take with respect to the plan, such as terminating the plan, are identified as \n\"risks\" to the consumer and are grouped together under the heading \"Risks,\" along with information about the \ndeductibility of interest for tax purposes. In consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the \nBoard tested versions of the application disclosures (in a narrative format) where the information about risk of loss \nof the home in case of default and the information about certain actions that a creditor may take with respect to the \nplan, such as terminating the plan, were placed near the top of the application disclosures, but were not grouped \ntogether under a common heading. The Board also tested versions of the application disclosures and the early \nHELOC disclosures (in a tabular format) where the information was grouped in the \"Risks\" section as discussed \nabove. Grouping these disclosures in a single \"Risks\" section made them more noticeable to participants, and \nmade it easier for participants to review the information quickly and efficiently.\n\nUnder the proposal, the \"Risks\" section would be placed at the bottom of the table on the second page of the early \nHELOC disclosures. In consumer testing by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested several different \nlocations for the \"Risks\" section in the table, namely, (1) at the top of the table on the first page of the early HELOC \ndisclosures, (2) in the middle of the table at the bottom of the first page of the early HELOC disclosures, and (3) at \nor near the bottom of the table on the second page of the early HELOC disclosures. In each round of the consumer \ntesting, participants were asked questions to determine whether they noticed and understood the information about \nrisk of the loss of the home if a consumer defaulted on the plan, and about the creditors' right to terminate the plan \nin certain circumstances. In several rounds of the consumer testing, participants also were asked their views on the \nplacement of the \"Risks\" section in the table. While some participants indicated that they preferred to have the \n\"Risks\" section displayed at the top of the table on the first page because of the importance of the information, other \nparticipants preferred to have the \"Risks\" section lower down in the table or at the bottom of the table on the second \npage because they were more interested in the specific terms of their line of credit, such as the APRs and the credit \n\n\n\nlimit offered on the plan. Regardless of the placement of the \"Risks\" section in the table, most participants noticed \nand understood the disclosure about the risk of loss of the home in case of default and the disclosure about a \ncreditor's right to terminate the plan in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Board proposes to place the \"Risks\" section at the bottom of the table on page two of the early HELOC \ndisclosures. The information contained in the \"Risks\" section may not be as useful to the consumers as other \ninformation contained in the table for comparing one HELOC to another, such as the APRs and credit limit offered \non the plan, because the information about risks is likely to be the same among all creditors. The Board seeks \ncomment on this aspect of the proposal.\n\nHighlighting of certain disclosures. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(vi) would require that certain early HELOC disclosures \nmust be disclosed in bold text. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to \nmake adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include \nfacilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. \nSee 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a).\n\nUnder the proposal, certain disclosures must be disclosed below the table because they provide general \ninformation that a consumer may want to consider when deciding whether to open the HELOC plan being offered \n(in contrast to information in the table that provides specific information about the terms being offered on the \nHELOC plan). To help consumers notice the statements that are below the table, the Board proposes that the \nfollowing statements must be disclosed in bold text: (1) A statement that the consumer is not required to accept the \nterms disclosed in the table, as required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2); (2) if the creditor has a provision for the \nconsumer's signature, a statement that a signature by the consumer only confirms receipt of the disclosure \nstatement, as required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2); (3) a statement identifying any disclosed term that is subject \nto change prior to opening the plan, as required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4)(i); (4) a statement that if the \nconsumer does not understand any disclosure required by this section the consumer should ask questions, as \nrequired under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(20); (5) a statement that the consumer may obtain additional information at \nthe Web site of the Board, and a reference to the Board's Web site, as required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(21); \nand (6) a statement that the consumer may be entitled to a refund of all fees paid if the consumer decides not to \nopen the plan, as required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(22)(i).\n\nIn addition, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c) generally requires that certain information about rates, fees, the credit limit, and \ncertain limitations or requirements on transactions, such as any minimum outstanding balance or minimum draw \nrequirements, applicable to the HELOC plan must be disclosed to the consumer as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures. This information includes not only the percentage or dollar amounts that will apply, but also explanatory \ninformation that gives context to these figures. The Board seeks to enable consumers to identify easily the rates, \nfees, the credit limit and the dollar amounts related to any limitations or requirements on transactions disclosed in \nthe table. Thus, the Board generally proposes to require the percentage or dollar amounts related to those \ndisclosures to be disclosed in bold text.\n\nNonetheless, the Board proposes several exceptions to the general rule that fees disclosed in the early HELOC \ndisclosures table must be disclosed in bold text. First, while the total amount of account-opening fees disclosed \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) would be required to be disclosed in bold text, the itemization of those fees also \nrequired to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) must not be disclosed in bold text. See proposed \ncomment 5b(b)(2)-5 provides that a creditor would be deemed to provide the itemization of the account-opening \nfees clearly and conspicuously if the creditor provides this information in a bullet format as shown in proposed \nSamples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G. The Board believes that the bullet format properly \nhighlights the itemization of the account-opening fees, and that requiring these fees also to be disclosed in bold text \nwould detract from the total amount of account-opening fees that is disclosed in bold text in the same row.\n\nSecond, under the proposal, periodic fees imposed by the creditor for availability of the plan pursuant to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(b)(12) that are not an annualized amount must not be disclosed in bold. Proposed comment 5b(b)(2)--3.ii \nprovides guidance on this exception for periodic fees. For example, if a creditor imposes a $ 10 monthly \n\n\n\nmaintenance fee for a HELOC plan, the creditor would be required to disclose in the table that there is a $ 10 \nmonthly maintenance fee, and that the fee is $ 120 on an annual basis. In this example, under the proposal, the $ \n10 fee disclosure must not be disclosed in bold, but the $ 120 annualized amount must be disclosed in bold. Under \nthe proposal, the periodic fee would be disclosed in the same row as the annualized amount of the fee. The Board \nbelieves that requiring the periodic fee to be in bold text would detract from the annualized amount of the fee that is \ndisclosed in bold text in the same row. The Board proposes to highlight in the table the annualized amount of a \nperiodic fee (rather than the amount of the periodic fees) because the Board believes this annualized amount will be \nmore useful to consumers in understanding the costs of the HELOC plan and deciding whether to open the HELOC \nplan offered by the creditor.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(vi)(E) provides that when a creditor is required to disclose certain payment terms under \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) in a format substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables found in \nproposed Samples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G, the creditor must provide in bold text any terms \nand phrases that are shown in bold text for that disclosure in the applicable tables. Proposed comment 5b(b)(2)--\n3.iii provides guidance on this requirement. For example, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) provides that a creditor must \ndistinguish payment terms applicable to the draw period and payment terms applicable to the repayment period by \nusing the heading \"Borrowing Period\" for the draw period and \"Repayment Period\" for the repayment period in a \nformat substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables found in proposed Samples G--14(C) \nand G--14(E) in Appendix G. See the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). The tables found in \nproposed Samples G--14(C) and G--14(E) in Appendix G show the headings \"Borrowing Period\" and \"Repayment \nPeriod\" in bold text, thus, a creditor must disclose these headings in bold text in providing the table.\n\nIn addition, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i) provides that when the length of the plan is definite, a creditor must disclose \nthe length of the plan, the length of the draw period and the length of the repayment period, if any, in a format \nsubstantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables found in proposed Samples G--14(C) and G--\n14(D) in Appendix G. The length of the draw period and any repayment period are shown in bold text in the \napplicable tables; thus, a creditor would be required to provide these disclosures in bold text. Moreover, proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(D) requires a creditor to provide the sample payments and related information required to be \ndisclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) in a format substantially similar to the format used in any of the \napplicable tables found in proposed Samples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G. Certain information \nrelated to these sample payments is shown in bold text in the applicable table; thus, a creditor would be required to \ndisclose this same information in bold text in providing the table.\n\nAs discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9), in the consumer \ntesting conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board found that certain formats set forth in the tables \nin proposed Samples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) to Appendix G, such as headings to distinguish payment \nterms applicable to the draw period and the repayment period, were effective in helping participants identify and \nunderstand the payment terms offered on the plan. Thus, the Board proposes to require the use of these formats, \nand to require the bold text that is used in the formats.\n\nTerminology. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(2), the Board proposes that \ncreditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b must use certain terminology when disclosing the draw period, any \nrepayment period, and certain other terms in the early HELOC disclosures table. See proposed 226.5(a)(2)(ii). \nProposed comment 5b(b)(2)-1 provides a cross reference to the terminology requirements set forth in proposed \u00a7 \n226.5(a)(2).\n\nClear and conspicuous standard. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(1), the \nBoard proposes a clear and conspicuous standard applicable to \u00a7 226.5b disclosures. Proposed comment 5b(b)(2)-\n4 provides a cross reference to the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to the disclosures in proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(b), as set forth in proposed comment 5(a)(1)-1.\n\nOther format requirements. Generally, the format requirements applicable to the early HELOC disclosures would be \nset forth in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2). Nonetheless, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) contains formatting requirements \n\n\n\napplicable to certain payment terms that must be disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures table. See section-by-\nsection analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). In addition, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(1) contains formatting \nrequirements applicable to disclosure of variable rates in the early HELOC disclosures table. Proposed comment \n5b(b)(2)-2 provides a cross reference to the formatting requirements set forth in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) and \n(c)(10). In addition, this proposed comment cross references proposed formatting requirements that would be \napplicable to information that a creditor would be required to provide to a consumer upon his or her request prior to \naccount opening, as described in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7), (c)(9), \n(c)(14), and (c)(18).\n\nElectronic disclosures. Current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(3) provides that for an application accessed by the consumer in \nelectronic form, the application disclosures and HELOC brochure may be provided to the consumer in electronic \nform on or with the application. Guidance on providing the required disclosures on or with an application accessed \nby the consumer in electronic form is found in current comments 5b(a)(1)-5 and 5b(a)(3)-1. As discussed in the \nsection-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2), the Board proposes to move the provisions in current \u00a7 \n226.5b(a)(3) and current comments 5b(a)(1)-5 and 5b(a)(3)-1 to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2) and proposed comments \n5b(a)(1)-6.ii and 5b(a)(2)-1, respectively, and to make revisions to those provisions. Under the proposal, the \nprovisions related to electronic disclosures would only apply to the disclosure of the \"Key Questions\" document \npublished by the Board that a creditor generally is required to provide with an application under proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(a). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(iii), the Board is \nnot proposing specific provisions on providing the early HELOC disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) in \nelectronic form. Thus, creditors would be required to obtain the consumer's consent, in accordance with the E-Sign \nAct, to provide the early HELOC disclosures in electronic form, or else provide written disclosures. This proposal \nnot to provide specific provisions for providing the early HELOC disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) in \nelectronic form is consistent with the Board's prior decisions on electronic disclosures of early mortgage disclosures \nthat are given after application but before consummation of the loan under \u00a7 226.19(a). In particular, in its \nrulemaking on electronic disclosures issued in November 2007, the Board did not include specific provisions for \nproviding these early mortgage disclosures in electronic form, and thus, creditors are required to obtain the \nconsumer's consent, in accordance with the E-Sign Act, to provide the early mortgage disclosures in electronic \nform, or else provide written disclosures. 72 FR 63462 (November 9, 2007); 72 FR 71058 (December 14, 2007).\n\nRetainable form. Current comment 5b(a)(1)-1 provides that the current application disclosures must be clear and \nconspicuous and in writing, but need not be in a form the consumer can keep. As discussed in the section-by-\nsection analysis to \u00a7 226.5(a)(1), the Board proposes to require that the early HELOC disclosures must be provided \nin a retainable form. See proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(B). Thus, the Board proposes to delete current comment \n5b(a)(1)-1 as obsolete.\n\nDisclosure of APR--more conspicuous requirement. Current comment 5b(a)(1)-2 provides a cross reference to \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5(a)(2), which provides that when the term \"annual percentage rate\" is required to be disclosed with a \nnumber in the application disclosures, the term \"annual percentage rate\" must be more conspicuous than other \nrequired disclosures. As discussed in the section-by-section to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(2), the Board proposes to \ndelete the requirement that the term \"annual percentage rate\" be more conspicuous than other required disclosures \nwhen disclosed with a number. Thus, the Board proposes to delete current comment 5b(a)(1)-2 as obsolete.\n\nMethod of providing disclosures. Current comment 5b(a)(1)-4 provides that in providing the application disclosures, \na creditor may provide a single disclosure form for all of its HELOC plans, as long as the disclosure describes all \naspects of the plans. For example, if the creditor offers several payment options, all payment options must be \ndisclosed. Alternatively, a creditor has the option of providing separate disclosure forms for multiple options or \nvariations in features. For example, a creditor that offers two payment options for the draw period may prepare \nseparate disclosure forms for the two payment options.\n\nThe Board proposes to delete current comment 5b(a)(1)-4 as obsolete. As discussed in more detail in the section-\nby-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9), under the proposal, creditors would not be allowed to disclose all \naspects of the plan in the table. For example, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c) provides that in making the early HELOC \n\n\n\ndisclosures, a creditor generally must not disclose terms applicable to a fixed-rate and -term payment feature \noffered during the draw period of the plan, unless that payment feature is the only payment plan offered during the \ndraw period of the plan.\n\nIn addition, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii), a creditor \nwould not be allowed to provide separate early HELOC disclosures for each payment option offered on the HELOC. \nSpecifically, if a creditor offers two or more payment plans on the HELOC plan (excluding the fixed-rate and -term \npayment plans described above unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period), a creditor \nmay not provide separate early HELOC disclosures for each payment plan, but instead must disclose only two \npayment plans in the table, in accordance with the requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B). (Under the \nproposal, a creditor would be required to disclose to a consumer other payment plans offered by the creditor upon \nrequest of the consumer. See proposed comments 5b(c)(9)(ii)-5 and 5b(c)(18)-2.)\n\n5b(b)(3) Disclosures Based on a Percentage\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) \nrequires a creditor to provide in the application disclosures an itemization of certain fees imposed by the creditor to \nopen, use, or maintain the plan, and these fees may be stated as a dollar amount or percentage of another amount \n(such as disclosing the amount of a fee as \"2% of the credit limit\"). In addition, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(10) requires a \ncreditor to disclose in the application disclosures any limitations on the number of extensions of credit and the \namount of credit that may be obtained during any time period, as well as any minimum outstanding balance and \nminimum draw requirements, stated as dollar amounts or percentages. In contrast, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(8) requires \na creditor to disclose in the application disclosures a good-faith-estimate of a total amount of fees that may be \nimposed by third parties to open a plan and the creditor must disclose that total as either a single dollar amount or \nrange.\n\nUnder the proposal, except for disclosing one-time fees imposed to open the plan, if the amount of any fee required \nto be disclosed in the table is determined on the basis of a percentage of another amount, the percentage used and \nthe identification of the amount against which the percentage is applied may be disclosed instead of the amount of \nthe fee. In addition, any limitations on the number of extensions of credit and the amount of credit that may be \nobtained during any time period, as well as any minimum outstanding balance and minimum draw requirements, \nrequired to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(16) may be disclosed as dollar amounts or percentages. See \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(3).\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), a creditor would be \nrequired to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures a total of one-time fees to open the account, \nand this total must include fees imposed by the creditor and any third party. In addition, a creditor would be required \nto disclose an itemization of all one-time fees to open the account, regardless of whether those fees are imposed by \na creditor or a third party. Both the total of one-time fees to open the account and the itemization of the fees must \nbe disclosed as a dollar amount (or a range of dollar amounts) and may not be disclosed as a percentage of \nanother amount. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(3) and (c)(11). The Board believes that requiring the one-time fees that \nare imposed to open the account to be disclosed as dollar amounts, instead of a percentage of another amount, \nwould aid consumers' understanding of the account-opening fees and may aid consumers in comparison shopping \nfor HELOC plans. In consumer testing conducted on credit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 \nRegulation Z Rule, the Board found that consumers generally understand dollar amounts better than percentages. \nAs a result, the Board believes that requiring account opening fees to be disclosed as dollar amounts instead of \npercentages of another amount would better enable consumers to understand the start up costs of opening the \nHELOC plan. In addition, consumers could more easily compare the dollar amount of one-time account-opening \nfees on different HELOC plans if all HELOC plans are required to disclose the dollar amount. Otherwise, consumers \nwould need to calculate the dollar amount themselves for some HELOC plans if the account-opening fees were \npresented as a percentage of another amount.\n\n\n\nConsistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7), however, under the proposal, if the amount of other fees that a creditor must \ndisclose in the table--namely, fees imposed by the creditor for the availability of the plan, fees imposed by the \ncreditor for early termination of the plan by the consumer and fees imposed for required insurance, debt \ncancellation or suspension coverage--are determined on the basis of a percentage of another amount, the \npercentage used and the identification of the amount against which the percentage is applied may be disclosed \ninstead of the amount of the fee. Similarly, consistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(10), the proposal would permit a \ncreditor to disclose the amount of any limitations on the number of extensions of credit, the amount of credit that \nmay be obtained during any time period, any minimum outstanding balance and minimum draw requirements, \nrequired to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(16) as either a dollar amount or percentage. The Board \nbelieves that allowing these fees and transaction requirements to be disclosed as a percentage of another amount \nis appropriate because these fees or transaction requirements generally would be imposed during the life of the \nplan, and thus, it may be difficult for a creditor to estimate a dollar amount for these fees or transaction \nrequirements at the time that the early HELOC disclosures are made.\n\n5b(c) Content of Disclosures\n\nCurrently, \u00a7 226.5b(d) sets forth the content for the application disclosures that a creditor must provide on or with \nthe application. As explained above, other than the \"Key Questions\" document required under proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(a), the Board proposes to delete the requirement that creditors provide disclosures to consumers on or with \nHELOC applications. Instead, the Board proposes that a creditor must provide the early HELOC disclosures \n(generally in the form of a table) to a consumer within three business days following receipt of the consumer's \napplication by the creditor (but not later than at account opening). Under the proposal, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c) sets \nforth the content for the early HELOC disclosures.\n\nFixed-rate and -term feature during draw period. HELOC plans typically offer the ability to obtain advances that \nmust be repaid based on a variable interest rate that applies to all outstanding balances. Some HELOC plans, \nhowever, also offer a fixed-rate and -term payment feature, where a consumer is permitted to repay all or part of the \nbalance during the draw period at a fixed rate (rather than a variable rate) and over a specified time period. The \nBoard understands that for most HELOC plans, consumers must take active steps to access the fixed-rate and -\nterm payment feature; this feature is not automatically accessed when a consumer obtains advances from the \nHELOC plan.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-2, which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(8), provides that a \ncreditor generally must disclose in the application disclosures terms that apply to the fixed-rate and -term payment \nfeature, including the period during which the feature can be selected, the length of time over which repayment can \noccur, any fees imposed for the feature, and the specific rate or a description of the index and margin that will apply \nupon exercise of the feature. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(8).\n\nThe Board proposes to delete current comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-2. The Board proposes that if a HELOC plan offers a \nvariable-rate feature and a fixed-rate and -term feature during the draw period, a creditor generally must not \ndisclose in the table the terms applicable to the fixed-rate and -term feature, except as discussed below. See \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c) and proposed comment 5b(c)--4. Instead, a creditor may disclose detailed information \nrelating to the fixed-rate and -term feature outside of the table. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(v). However, if a \nHELOC plan does not offer a variable-rate feature during the draw period, but only offers a fixed-rate and -term \nfeature during that period, a creditor must disclose in the table information related to the fixed-rate and -term feature \nwhen making the disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c). The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its \nauthority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the \nstatute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers \navoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a).\n\nThe Board believes that including information about the variable-rate feature and the fixed-rate and -term feature in \nthe table would create \"information overload\" for consumers. The terms that apply to the fixed-rate and -term \nfeatures often differ significantly from the terms that apply to the variable-rate feature. For example, different APRs, \n\n\n\nfees, length of repayment periods, limitations on the number of transactions, and minimum transactions amounts \nmay apply to the fixed-rate and -term feature than the variable-rate feature. In addition, creditors often provide \nconsumers with several options related to the fixed-rate and -term feature, such as providing several lengths of \nrepayment period (e.g., 3, 5, or 7 years) from which a consumer may choose for a particular advance under the \nfixed-rate and -term feature. The Board believes that requiring a creditor to provide all of these details about the \nfixed-rate and -term feature in the table would add to the length and complexity of the table, and would create \n\"information overload\" for consumers.\n\nInstead of requiring that all the details of the fixed-rate and -term feature be disclosed in the table, the Board \nproposes to require a creditor offering this payment feature (in addition to a variable-rate feature) to disclose in the \ntable the following: (1) A statement that the consumer has the option during the draw period to borrow at a fixed \ninterest rate; (2) the amount of the credit line that the consumer may borrow at a fixed interest rate for a fixed term; \nand (3) as applicable, either a statement that the consumer may receive, upon request, further details about the \nfixed-rate and -term payment feature, or, if information about the fixed-rate and -term payment feature is provided \nwith the table, a reference to the location of the information. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(18). Thus, under the \nproposal, a consumer would be notified in the table about the fixed-rate and -term payment feature, and could \nrequest additional information about this payment feature (if a creditor chose not to provide additional information \nabout this feature outside of the table).\n\nIn responding to a consumer's request, prior to account opening, for additional information about the fixed-rate and \n-term feature, a creditor would be required to provide this additional information as soon as reasonably possible \nafter the request. See proposed comment 5b(c)-2. Additional information disclosed about the fixed-rate and -term \npayment feature upon request (or outside the early HELOC disclosures table) would have to include in the form of a \ntable, (1) information about the APRs and payment terms applicable to the fixed-rate and -term payment feature, \nand (2) any fees imposed related to the use of the fixed-rate and -term payment feature, such as fees to exercise \nthe fixed-rate and -term payment option or to convert a balance under a fixed-rate and -term payment feature to a \nvariable-rate feature under the plan. See proposed comment 5b(c)(18)-2. The Board believes that the above \napproach to providing information to consumers about the fixed-rate and -term feature enables consumers \ninterested in this feature to obtain additional information about this optional feature easily and quickly, but does not \ncontribute to \"information overload\" for consumers in general.\n\nDuty to respond to requests for information. Current comment 5b(d)-2 provides that if the consumer, prior to \nopening a plan, requests information as described in the application disclosures, such as the current index value or \nmargin, the creditor must provide this information as soon as reasonably possible after the request. The Board \nproposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(c)-2 and apply it to requests for additional information \ndescribed in the early HELOC disclosures, namely requests for additional information about the following: (1) Fees \napplicable to the plan under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(14); (2) the conditions under which a creditor may take certain \nactions under the plan, such as terminating the plan, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7); (3) payment plans offered on \nthe plan not described as part of the early HELOC disclosures (other than fixed-rate and -term payment plans \nunless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period) required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii); \nand (4) fixed-rate and -term payment plans under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(18). The Board proposes to revise this \ncomment to update the examples of information that a consumer may receive upon request (such as additional \ninformation on fees applicable to the plan or the conditions under which the creditor may take certain actions on the \nplan) and to provide a cross reference to comments that specifically discuss a consumer's right to request the four \ntypes of additional information listed above.\n\nDisclosure of repayment phase--applicability of requirements. Some HELOC plans provide in the initial agreement \nfor a repayment period during which no further draws may be taken and repayment of the amount borrowed is \nrequired. Current comment 5b-4 provides that a creditor must disclose information relating to the repayment period, \nas well as the draw period, when providing the application disclosures. Thus, for example, a creditor must provide \npayment information about any repayment phase as well as about the draw period in the application disclosures, as \nrequired by current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5). The Board proposes to move the relevant part of this comment to proposed \n5b(c)-3, and to make technical revisions to the comment. Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to \n\n\n\ndisclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures information relating to any repayment period, as well as \nthe draw period.\n\nDisclosures given as applicable. Current comment 5b(d)-1 provides that a creditor may provide the application \ndisclosures described in current \u00a7 226.5b(d) as applicable. For example, if negative amortization cannot occur in a \nHELOC plan, a reference to it need not be made under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(9). The Board proposes to move this \ncomment to proposed 5b(c)-1 and revise the comment to refer to the following proposed exceptions to the general \nrule that a creditor is only required to include a disclosure required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c) as applicable: \nspecifically, proposed 5b(c)-1 cross references proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(3) and (c)(9)(iii)(C)(4), which provide \nthat a creditor in certain circumstances must state that a balloon payment will not result for plans in which no \nballoon payment would occur; in addition, proposed comment 5b(c)-1 cross references proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(5), which provides that if there are no annual or other periodic limitations on changes in the \nAPR, a creditor must state that no annual limitation exists.\n\n5b(c)(1) Identification Information\n\nCurrently, a creditor is not required to disclose identification information about the creditor and the borrower as part \nof the application disclosures. Pursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional \ndisclosures for HELOC plans, the Board proposes to require that a creditor disclose as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures the following identification information: (1) The consumer's name and address; (2) the identity of the \ncreditor making the disclosure; (3) the date the disclosure was prepared; and (4) the loan originator's unique \nidentifier, as defined by the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (\"SAFE Act\") Sections \n1503(3) and (12), 12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12). 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). Under the proposal, these disclosures must \nbe placed directly above the table provided as part of the early HELOC disclosures, in a format substantially similar \nto any of the applicable tables found in G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(b)(2)(iii). Proposed comment 5b(c)(1)-1 clarifies that in identifying the creditor making the disclosure, use of \nthe creditor's name would be sufficient, but the creditor may also include an address and/or telephone number. In \ntransactions with multiple creditors, any one of them would be allowed to make the disclosures; the one doing so \nmust be identified in the early HELOC disclosures. The Board solicits comment on whether the creditor making the \ndisclosures should be required to disclose its contact information, such as its address and/or telephone number.\n\nThe Board believes that this identification information would provide context for the disclosures provided in the \ntable. For example, the date the disclosure was prepared would provide consumers information about the date on \nwhich the terms in the table were accurate. In addition, the Board believes it is important to disclose the creditor's \nidentity so that consumers can easily identify the appropriate entity.\n\nLoan originator's unique identifier. On July 30, 2008, the SAFE Act, 12 U.S.C. 5101-5116, was enacted to create a \nNationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry of loan originators to increase uniformity, reduce fraud and \nregulatory burden, and enhance consumer protection. 12 U.S.C. 5102. Under the SAFE Act, a \"loan originator\" is \ndefined as \"an individual who (i) takes a residential mortgage loan application; and (ii) offers or negotiates terms of \na residential mortgage loan for compensation or gain.\" 12 U.S.C. 5102(3)(A)(i). Each loan originator is required to \nobtain a unique identifier through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. 12 U.S.C. 5103(a)(2). \nThe term \"unique identifier\" is defined as \"a number or other identifier that (i) permanently identifies a loan \noriginator; (ii) is assigned by protocols established by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry and \nthe Federal banking agencies to facilitate electronic tracking of loan originators and uniform identification of, and \npublic access to, the employment history of and the publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions \nagainst loan originators; and (iii) shall not be used for purposes other than those set forth under this title.\" 15 U.S.C. \n5102(12)(A). The system is intended to provide consumers with easily accessible information to research a loan \noriginator's history of employment and any disciplinary or enforcement actions against him or her. 12 U.S.C. \n5101(7).\n\nTo facilitate the use of the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry and promote the informed use of \ncredit, pursuant to the Board's authority under TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for \n\n\n\nHELOC plans, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(1) to require that a loan originator to disclose as part of the \nearly HELOC disclosures his or her unique identifier, as defined by the SAFE Act. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). \nProposed comment 5b(c)(1)-2 clarifies that in transactions with multiple loan originators, each loan originator's \nunique identifier must be listed on the early HELOC disclosures. For example, in a transaction where a mortgage \nbroker meets the SAFE Act definition of loan originator, the identifiers for the broker and for its employee loan \noriginator meeting that definition would need to be listed on the early HELOC disclosures.\n\nThe Board notes that the Board, FDIC, OCC, OTS, NCUA, and Farm Credit Administration have published a \nproposed rule to implement the SAFE Act. See 74 FR 27386 (June 9, 2009). In this proposed rule, the federal \nbanking agencies have requested comment on whether there are mortgage loans for which there may be no \nmortgage loan originator. For example, the agencies query whether there are situations where a consumer applies \nfor and is offered a loan through an automated process without contact with a mortgage loan originator. See id. at \n27397. The Board solicits comments on the scope of this problem and its impact on the requirements of proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(1).\n\nStatement About Retaining a Copy of the Disclosures\n\nThe Board proposes to delete current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(1), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(6)(C), and current \ncomment 5b(d)(1)-1 as obsolete. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(1) provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the \napplication disclosures a statement that the consumer should make or otherwise retain a copy of the application \ndisclosures. Current comment 5b(d)(1)-1 provides that a creditor need not disclose that the consumer should make \nor otherwise retain a copy of the disclosures if they are retainable--for example, if the disclosures are not part of an \napplication that must be returned to the creditor to apply for the plan. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-\nsection analysis to \u00a7 226.5(a)(1), however, the Board proposes to require a creditor to provide the early HELOC \ndisclosures in a retainable form.\n\n5b(c)(2) No Obligation Statement\n\nPursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, \nthe Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2) to require a creditor to disclose as part of the early HELOC disclosures a \nstatement that the consumer has no obligation to accept the terms disclosed in the table. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). \nIn addition, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2), if a creditor provides space for the consumer to sign or initial the early \nHELOC disclosures, the creditor would be required to include a statement that a signature by the consumer only \nconfirms receipt of the disclosure statement. A creditor would be required to provide these proposed disclosures \ndirectly below the table provided as part of the early HELOC disclosures, in, a format substantially similar to any of \nthe applicable tables found in proposed Samples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--15(E) in Appendix G. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(b)(2)(iv).\n\nAs discussed in the proposal issued by the Board on closed-end mortgages published elsewhere in today's Federal \nRegister, in consumer testing conducted by the Board on closed-end mortgage products, participants reviewed \nmock ups of mortgage disclosures that would be given within three business days after a consumer's application \nhas been received by the creditor for a mortgage loan. These participants were asked whether they would be \nobligated to accept the loan terms described in the disclosures because they had submitted an application for a \nmortgage. Most participants initially understood in reviewing the tested mortgage disclosures that they would not be \nrequired to accept the loan terms described in the disclosures. However, some participants later believed they \nwould be obligated to accept the loan upon signing or initialing the disclosure. Based on this consumer testing, the \nBoard is concerned that although consumers may initially understand they are not obligated to accept the terms of \nthe HELOC plan, this belief may be diminished if a creditor requires a consumer to sign or initial receipt of the early \nHELOC disclosures. This may further discourage negotiation and shopping among HELOC products and creditors. \nThus, the Board proposes to require a creditor to disclose as part of the early HELOC disclosures a statement that \nthe consumer has no obligation to accept the terms disclosed in the table. In addition, if a creditor provides space \n\n\n\nfor the consumer to sign or initial the early HELOC disclosures, the creditor would be required to include a \nstatement that a signature by the consumer only confirms receipt of the disclosure statement.\n\n5b(c)(3) Identification of Plan as a Home-Equity Line of Credit\n\nPursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures with respect to \nHELOC plans, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(3) to require that creditors as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures disclose above the table a statement that the consumer has applied for a home-equity line of credit. 15 \nU.S.C. 1637a(a)(14).\n\nIn consumer testing the Board conducted on HELOCs disclosures, most participants had obtained a HELOC in the \npast, but some participants were also recruited who had considered obtaining a HELOC but opted instead for a \nhome-equity loan. A few participants had never obtained a home-equity loan or HELOC, but had considered \nopening a HELOC in the past five years. In the consumer testing, during the initial portion of the interview, several \nparticipants appeared not to understand the difference between a home-equity loan and a HELOC. For example, \none person initially indicated that she had a home-equity loan, but after the difference was explained to her she \nrealized that she actually had a HELOC.\n\nBased on this consumer testing, the Board proposes to take several steps to address potential confusion by \nconsumers about the differences between these two types of home-equity products. First, as discussed in the \nsection-by-section analysis to \u00a7 226.5b(a), the \"Key Questions\" document that would be required to be given with \napplications for HELOCs (except for telephone applications where this document must be given with the early \nHELOC disclosures) includes information describing the relative advantages and disadvantages of a HELOC and a \nhome-equity loan. Second, as noted, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(3) creditors would be required as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures to disclose above the table that the consumer has applied for a home-equity line of credit. This \nstatement will identify clearly for the consumer that he or she has applied for a HELOC, and may help a consumer \nwho mistakenly thought he or she was applying for a home-equity loan.\n\n5b(c)(4) Conditions for Disclosed Terms\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(2)(i), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(6)(A), provides that creditors must disclose as \npart of the application disclosures a statement of the time by which the consumer must submit an application to \nobtain specific terms disclosed in the application disclosures and an identification of any disclosed term that is \nsubject to change prior to opening the plan. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(6)(A). Current comment 5b(d)(2)(i)-1 provides that \nthe requirement that a creditor disclose the time by which an application must be submitted to obtain the disclosed \nterms does not require the creditor to guarantee any terms. If a creditor chooses not to guarantee any terms, it must \ndisclose that all of the terms are subject to change prior to opening the plan. The creditor also is permitted to \nguarantee some terms and not others, but must indicate which terms are subject to change. Current comment \n5b(d)(2)(i)-2 provides that if a creditor chooses to guarantee terms disclosed in the application disclosures, a \ncreditor may disclose either a specific date or a time period for obtaining the guaranteed terms. If the creditor \ndiscloses a time period, the consumer must be able to determine from the disclosure the specific date by which an \napplication must submitted to obtain any guaranteed terms.\n\nUnder current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(2)(ii), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(6)(B), a creditor also must provide as part \nof the application disclosures a statement that if a disclosed term changes (other than a change due to fluctuations \nin the index in a variable-rate plan) prior to opening the plan and the consumer therefore elects not to open the plan \nthe consumer may receive a refund of all fees paid in connection with the application. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(6)(B). \nCurrent comment 5b(d)(2)(ii)-1 provides that a creditor should consult the rules in current \u00a7 226.5b(g) regarding \nrefund of fees when terms change.\n\nProposal. The Board proposes to move the provisions in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(2) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4) and to \nrevise those provisions. Specifically, because the early HELOC disclosures would be given after the application has \nbeen submitted by the consumer, the Board proposes to delete as obsolete (1) the requirement in current \u00a7 \n\n\n\n226.5b(d)(2), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(6)(A), that a creditor provide a statement of the time by \nwhich the consumer must submit an application to obtain specific terms disclosed in the application disclosures, \nand (2) guidance for providing that statement in current comment 5b(d)(2)(i)-2. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(6)(A). The \nBoard proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the \nrequirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare \ncredit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a).\n\nConsistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(2)(i), the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4)(i) to require that a creditor \ndisclose directly below the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures an identification of any disclosed term that \nis subject to change prior to opening the plan. The Board also proposes to move the provisions in current comment \n5b(d)(2)(i)-1 that relate to this disclosure to proposed comment 5b(c)(4)(i)-1. Specifically, proposed comment \n5b(c)(4)(i)-1 provides that if a creditor chooses not to guarantee any terms, it must disclose that all of the terms are \nsubject to change prior to opening the plan. The creditor also would be permitted to guarantee some terms and not \nothers, but would be required to indicate which terms are subject to change.\n\nThe Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4)(ii) to require that a creditor disclose in the table as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures a statement that, if a disclosed term changes (other than a change due to fluctuations in the \nindex in a variable-rate plan) prior to opening the plan and the consumer elects not to open the plan, the consumer \nmay receive a refund of all fees paid. The language in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4)(ii) differs from current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(2)(ii), \nto reflect proposed changes in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(d). Currently \u00a7 226.5b(g) contains the substantive right of a \nconsumer to receive a refund if terms change and the consumer decides not to open the HELOC plan. As \ndiscussed in more detail in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(d), the Board proposes to move the substantive right to a refund of \nfees if terms change from current \u00a7 226.5b(g) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(d) and to revise those provisions. The language \nin proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4)(ii) reflects the proposed changes in \u00a7 226.5b(d).\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to move guidance on disclosing the statement about refundability of fees if terms \nchange from current comment 5b(d)(2)(ii)-1 to proposed comment 5b(c)(4)(ii)-1, and to make technical revisions to \nthe proposed comment.\n\n5b(c)(5) Statement Regarding Refund of Fees Under Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(e)\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(h) provides that neither a creditor nor any other person may impose a nonrefundable fee in \nconnection with an application until three business days after the consumer receives the application disclosures and \nthe HELOC brochure. Current comment 5(h)-1 provides that if a creditor collects a fee after the consumer receives \nthe application disclosures and the HELOC brochure and before the expiration of the three days, the creditor must \nnotify the consumer that the fee is refundable for three days. The notice must be clear and conspicuous and in \nwriting, and may be included with the application disclosures or as an attachment to them.\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(e), the Board proposes to move \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5b(h) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(e) and revise it. The Board proposes to add new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(5) to require \na creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures a statement that the consumer may \nreceive a refund of all fees paid, if the consumer notifies the creditor within three business days of receiving the \nearly HELOC disclosures that the consumer does not want to open the plan. The proposed disclosure would be \nrequired if a creditor will impose fees on the HELOC plan prior to the expiration of the three-day period. Proposed \ncomment 5(c)(5)-1 provides that creditors should consult the rules in \u00a7 226.5b(e) regarding refund of fees if the \nconsumer rejects the plan within three business days of receiving the early HELOC disclosures.\n\n5b(c)(6) Security Interest and Risk to Home\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(3), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(5), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of \nthe application disclosures a statement that the creditor will acquire a security interest in the consumer's dwelling \nand that loss of the dwelling may occur in the event of default. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(5). The Board proposes to move \n\n\n\nthis disclosure requirement from current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(3) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(6). Thus, under the proposal, a \ncreditor would be required to disclose this statement in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures.\n\n5b(c)(7) Possible Actions by Creditor\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(i), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(7)(A), provides that a creditor must disclose as \npart of the application disclosures a statement that, under certain conditions, the creditor may terminate the plan \nand require payment of the outstanding balance in full in a single payment and impose fees upon termination; \nprohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limit; and, as specified in the initial agreement, \nimplement certain changes in the plan. 16\n\nThe Board proposes to move the provisions in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(i) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(i) and to revise \nthose provisions. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(i) provides that a creditor must disclose in the table as part \nof the early HELOC disclosures a statement that, under certain conditions, the creditor may terminate the plan and \nrequire payment of the outstanding balance in full in a single payment and impose fees upon termination; prohibit \nadditional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limit; and make other changes in the plan. Current comment \n5b(d)(4)(i)-1 provides guidance on when a creditor must provide the statement that a creditor under certain \nconditions may impose fees upon termination of the plan. This comment would be moved to proposed comment \n5b(c)(7)(i)-1.\n\nThe circumstances in which a creditor must provide the disclosure regarding implementing \"changes in the plan\" \nwould be broader under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(i) than under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(i). As explained in current \ncomment 5b(d)(4)(i)-2, a creditor must provide the disclosure regarding implementing changes in the plan under \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(i) only if the initial agreement contains specific changes that may be made in the plan if \nspecific events take place (see \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i)), such as provisions in the initial agreement that the APR will \nincrease a specified amount if the consumer leaves the creditor's employment. If no specific changes are set forth \nin the initial agreement pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i), but the creditor may make changes in the plan under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(ii) through (v), such as making a change that will unequivocally benefit the consumer under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(iv), a creditor is not required under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(i) to disclose that the creditor in certain \ncircumstances may make certain changes in the plan.\n\nAs explained in proposed comment 5b(c)(7)(i)-2, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(i), a creditor would be required to \ndisclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures a statement that the creditor under certain conditions \nmay make changes in the plan, if the creditor may make any changes in the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i)-(v), \nincluding making a change that will unequivocally benefit the consumer under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iv), even if the creditor \ndoes not set forth specific changes in the plan for specific events in the initial agreement under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i). \nThe Board believes that if a creditor may make any changes to the plan, consumers should be informed generally \nof this fact.\n\nUnder current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(ii), which implements TILA Section 127a(a)(7)(B), a creditor must disclose as part of \nthe application disclosures a statement that the consumer may receive, upon request, information about the \nconditions under which a creditor may take certain actions, such as terminating the plan, as discussed above. 15 \n\n16 TILA Section 127A(a)(7) does not specifically require that a creditordisclose as part of the application disclosures a statement \nthat under certain conditions the creditor may impose fees upon termination or may implement certain changes in the plans as \nspecified in the initial agreement. The Board included these disclosures in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(i) pursuant to its authority in \nTILA Section 127A(a)(14) to required additional disclosures for HELOC plans.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nU.S.C. 1637a(a)(7)(B). Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(iii) provides a creditor may provide a disclosure of the conditions in \nlieu of the statement that a consumer may receive that information upon request. 17\n\nThe Board proposes to move the provisions in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(ii) and (iii) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(ii) and \nrevise those provisions. In particular, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(ii), a creditor may either provide a statement \nthat the consumer may receive, upon request, information about the conditions under which a creditor may take \ncertain actions such as terminating the plan or disclose those conditions with the early HELOC disclosures (outside \nthe table). If a creditor chooses to provide as part of the early HELOC disclosures a statement that the consumer \nmay receive, upon request, information about the conditions, this statement must be disclosed in the table. If a \ncreditor chooses to provide a disclosure of the conditions with the early HELOC disclosures, the disclosure of the \nconditions must not be disclosed in the table. The disclosure of the conditions must be provided outside the table, \nand a creditor must disclose in the table a reference to the location of the disclosure.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(4)(iii)-2 provides if a creditor chooses to disclose the conditions in lieu of providing that \ninformation upon request, the creditor may provide the disclosure of the conditions with the other application \ndisclosures or apart from them. If the creditor elects to provide the disclosure of the conditions with the application \ndisclosures, this disclosure need not comply with the precedence rule in current \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2). Under the proposal, \ncurrent comment 5b(d)(4)(iii)-2 would be deleted. As discussed above, under the proposal, a creditor would not be \nallowed to include the disclosure of conditions under which a creditor may take certain actions, as discussed above, \nin the table. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(ii) and (b)(2)(v). The Board believes that including a disclosure of the \nconditions in the table could lead to \"information overload\" for consumers, distracting consumers from other \nimportant information in the table. The conditions under which a creditor may take certain actions, such as \nterminating the HELOC plan, will likely not change from creditor to creditor, and thus this information may not be \nuseful to consumers in comparing one HELOC plan to another.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(4)(iii)-1 provides guidance on how a creditor may provide the disclosure of the conditions if \na creditor is providing this information with the application disclosures. The Board proposes to move the provisions \nin current comment \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(iii)-1 to proposed comment \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7)(ii)-1 and make revisions to the \nprovisions. In particular, proposed comment 5b(c)(7)(ii)-1 would provide guidance on how a creditor may provide \nthe disclosures of the conditions, either upon the request of the consumer prior to account opening or with the early \nHELOC disclosures (outside the table).\n\n5b(c)(8) Tax Implications\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(11), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(13)(A), provides that a creditor must disclose as \npart of the application disclosures a statement that the consumer should consult a tax advisor regarding the \ndeductibility of interest and charges under the plan. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(13)(A). The Board proposes to move \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(11) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(8) and make technical revisions. In addition, to implement Section \n1302 of the Bankruptcy Act (cited above), which requires disclosure of the tax implications for home-secured credit \nthat may exceed the dwelling's fair-market value, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(8) to require a creditor as \npart of the early HELOC disclosures to disclose a statement that the interest on the portion of the credit extension \nthat is greater than the fair market value of the dwelling may not be tax deductible for Federal income tax purposes \n\n17 TILA Section 127A(a)(7) does not specifically allow a creditor todisclose a statement of the conditions in lieu of the statement \nthat a consumer 111 ay receive that information upon request. The Board provided this alternative in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4) \npursuant to the Board authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments to the requirements in TILA that are necessary to \neffectuate the purposes of TILA.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nand that the consumer should consult a tax advisor for further information on tax deductibility. 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(a)(13)(B).\n\nThe Board stated its intent to implement the Bankruptcy Act amendments in an ANPR published in October 2005 as \npart of the Board's ongoing review of Regulation Z (October 2005 ANPR). 70 FR 60235 (October 17, 2005). The \nBoard received approximately 50 comment letters: forty-five letters were submitted by financial institutions and their \ntrade groups, and five letters were submitted by consumer groups. In general, creditors asked for flexibility in \nproviding the disclosure regarding the tax implications for home-secured credit that may exceed the dwelling's fair-\nmarket value, either by permitting the notice to be provided to all applicants, or to be provided later in the approval \nprocess after creditors have determined whether the disclosure is triggered. Creditor commenters asked for \nguidance on loan-to-value calculations and safe harbors for how creditors should determine property values. \nConsumer advocates favored triggering the disclosure when the possibility of negative amortization could occur. A \nnumber of commenters stated that in order for the disclosure to be effective and useful to the borrower, it should be \ngiven when the new extension of credit, combined with existing credit secured by the dwelling (if any), may exceed \nthe fair market value of the dwelling. A few industry comments took the opposite view that the disclosure should be \nlimited only to when a new extension of credit itself exceeds fair market value, citing the difficulty of determining \nhow much debt is already secured by the dwelling at the time of application.\n\nThe Board implemented Section 1302 with regard to advertisements in its July 2008 HOEPA final rule. See 73 FR \n44522 (July 30, 2008). In the Supplementary Information to that rule, the Board stated its intent to implement the \napplication disclosure portion of the Bankruptcy Act during its forthcoming review of closed-end and HELOC \ndisclosures under TILA.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(8) would implement provisions of the Bankruptcy Act by requiring creditors to include in the \ntable required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) as part of the early HELOC disclosures (1) a statement that the interest \non the portion of the credit extension that is greater than the fair market value of the dwelling may not be tax \ndeductible for Federal income tax purposes and (2) a statement that the consumer should consult a tax advisor for \nfurther information on tax deductibility.\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors offering HELOCs to provide this disclosure to all HELOC applicants as part \nof the early HELOC disclosures, even if the particular HELOC plan offered to the consumer is not designed to allow \nthe consumer to take extensions of credit that exceed the fair market value of the dwelling. The Board recognizes \nthat HELOCs by their very nature carry a possibility that subsequent draws may exceed the fair market value of the \ndwelling. First, the market value of a dwelling may decline during the term of a HELOC plan, leaving less equity \navailable. Second, quite often, consumers who apply for HELOCs already have first-lien mortgages; the amount of \nequity that a consumer may be able to utilize is limited, in part, by how much the consumer owes on the first \nmortgage. For these reasons, the likelihood is higher with HELOCs than closed-end home-equity loans that the \nconsumer may exceed the fair market value of the dwelling with subsequent draws.\n\n5b(c)(9) Payment Terms\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(8), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of \nthe application disclosures the payment terms applicable to the plan, and sets forth specific information that must \nbe included in this disclosure. As discussed below, the Board proposes to move the provisions in current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(5) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) and to revise them.\n\nFormat for identifying payment terms applicable to the draw period and the repayment period. Current comment 5b-\n4 provides that a creditor must disclose information relating to the repayment period, as well as the draw period, \nwhen providing the application disclosures. Thus, for example, a creditor must provide payment information about \nany repayment phase as well as about the draw period in the application disclosures, as required by current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(5). The Board proposes to move the relevant part of this comment to proposed 5b(c)-3, and to make \ntechnical edits to the comment. Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the table as part of \nthe early HELOC disclosures information relating to any repayment period, as well as the draw period.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to require that when disclosing payment terms in the table, a creditor must \ndistinguish payment terms applicable to the draw period from payment terms applicable to the repayment period, by \nusing the heading \"Borrowing Period\" for the draw period and \"Repayment Period\" for the repayment period, in a \nformat substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables in proposed Samples G--14(C) and G--\n14(E) in Appendix G. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a); see proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). Thus, under the proposal, a creditor would \nbe required to include the heading \"Borrowing Period\" each place payment information about the draw period is \nincluded in the table, and the heading \"Repayment Period\" each place payment information about the repayment \nperiod is included in the table, in a format substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables \nfound in G--14(C) and G--14(E) in Appendix G. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA \nSection 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's \npurposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the \nuniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a).\n\nIn consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested application disclosures in a \nnarrative form, designed to simulate those currently in use. When reviewing these application disclosures, many \nparticipants had difficulty understanding how the draw period differs from the repayment period, and what impact \nthese distinctions have on required monthly payments. In the consumer testing, the Board tested versions of the \nearly HELOC disclosures where the heading \"Borrowing Period\" was included each place payment information \nabout the draw period was presented in the table and the heading \"Repayment Period\" was included each place \npayment information about the repayment period was presented in the table. In reviewing these versions of the \nearly HELOC disclosures, participants were better able to understand the differences between the draw period and \nthe repayment period, and the impact these differences have on required monthly payments. Thus, the Board \nproposes to require that a creditor use the headings \"Borrowing Period\" and \"Repayment Period\" in the table to \ndistinguish payment terms applicable to the draw period from payment terms applicable to the repayment period, \nrespectively, in a format substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables in proposed Samples \nG--14(C) and 14(E) in Appendix G.\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(9)(i)\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(i), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(8)(B), requires a creditor to disclose as part of \nthe application disclosures the length of the draw period and the length of any repayment period. 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(a)(8)(B). Current comment 5b(d)(5)(i)-1 provides that the combined length of the draw period and any \nrepayment period need not be disclosed in the application disclosures.\n\nFor the reasons described below, pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional \ndisclosures for HELOC plans, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i) to require that a creditor disclose in the \ntable as part of the early HELOC disclosures the length of the plan, as well as the length of the draw period and the \nlength of any repayment period. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). In addition, under the proposal, if there is no repayment \nperiod on the HELOC plan, a creditor would be required to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures a statement that after the draw period ends, the consumer must repay the remaining balance in full.\n\nLength of the HELOC plan is definite. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i) would require that when the length of the plan is \ndefinite, a creditor, when disclosing the length of the plan, the length of the draw period and the length of any \nrepayment period in the table, must make those disclosures using a format substantially similar to the format used \nin any of the applicable tables found in proposed Samples G--14(C) and G--14(D) in Appendix G. Proposed \ncomment 5b(c)(9)(i)-1.i would provide that if a maturity date is set forth for the HELOC plan, the length of the plan, \nthe length of the draw period and the length of any repayment period are definite. This proposed comment also \nstates that the length of the plan must be based on the maturity date of the plan, regardless of whether the \noutstanding balance may be paid off before or after the maturity date. For example, assume that a plan has a draw \nperiod of 10 years and a maturity date of 20 years. If the outstanding balance on the plan is not paid off by the \nmaturity date, the creditor could extend the maturity date of the plan and require the consumer to make minimum \npayments until the outstanding balance is repaid. In this example, the proposed comment clarifies that the creditor \n\n\n\nmust disclose the length of the HELOC plan as 20 years, the length of the draw period as 10 years and the length \nof the repayment period as 10 years.\n\nIn consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested application disclosures in a \nnarrative form, designed to simulate application disclosures currently in use. In these versions of the application \ndisclosures, the length of the draw period and the length of the repayment period were disclosed, but the total \nlength of the plan was not disclosed. When reviewing these application disclosures, many participants had difficulty \nunderstanding the timing of the draw and repayment periods. For example, several participants incorrectly thought \nthat the two periods ran concurrently, or that the repayment period began as soon as money was borrowed.\n\nIn the consumer testing, the Board also tested versions of the early HELOC disclosures developed by the Board \nwhere the length of the plan was 20 years, and the length of the draw and repayment periods was 10 years each. In \nthese tested versions of the early HELOC disclosures, the length of the plan was disclosed as 20 years, along with \na statement indicating that this period is divided into two periods. The length of the draw period was then disclosed \nas \"Years (1-10)\" and the length of the repayment period was disclosed as \"Years (11-20),\" to indicate that those \nperiods would run consecutively and not concurrently. In addition, the length of the draw period and the length of \nthe repayment period were included as part of the headings \"Borrowing Period\" (for the draw period) and \n\"Repayment Period\" (for the repayment period), respectively, each time those headings were used. In the \nconsumer testing, the Board found that including the length of the plan in the table and using the above format for \npresenting the length of the plan, the length of the draw period and the length of the repayment period effectively \nhelped participants understand the timing of the two periods.\n\nThus, the Board proposes to require creditors to disclose the length of the plan in the table, along with the length of \nthe draw period and the length of any repayment period. In addition, as explained in proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(i)-\n3, the Board proposes to require that creditors use the above format in presenting the length of the plan, the length \nof the draw period and the length of the repayment period in the table for HELOC plans that have a definite length \nand have a draw period and a repayment period, as shown in proposed Sample G--14(C) in Appendix G. Proposed \ncomment 5b(c)(9)(i)-3 also specifies that proposed Sample G--14(D) in Appendix G shows the format a creditor \nmust use to disclose the length of the plan and the length of the draw period for HELOC plans that have a definite \nlength and have a draw period but no repayment period.\n\nLength of plan and length of repayment period cannot be determined at the time the early HELOC disclosures must \nbe given. Current comment 5b(d)(5)(i)-1 provides that if the length of the repayment period cannot be determined \nbecause, for example, it depends on the balance outstanding at the beginning of the repayment period, the creditor \nmust disclose in the application disclosures that the length of the repayment period is determined by the size of the \nbalance. The Board proposes to move this provision in current comment 5b(d)(5)(i)-1 to proposed comment \n5b(c)(9)(i)-1.ii, and to revise it.\n\nSpecifically, proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(i)-1.ii addresses HELOC plans that do not have a maturity date, and for \nwhich the length of the plan and the length of the repayment period cannot be determined at the time the early \nHELOC disclosures must be given because the repayment period depends on the balance outstanding at the \nbeginning of the repayment period or the balance at the time of the last advance during the draw period. For these \nplans, the creditor would be required to state that the length of the plan and the length of the repayment period are \ndetermined by the size of the balance outstanding at the beginning of the repayment period or the balance at the \ntime of the last advance during the draw period, as applicable.\n\nProposed comment 5b(c)(9)(i)-1.ii provides two illustrations of this rule. The first would assume that the plan has no \nmaturity date, the draw period is 10 years, and the minimum payment during the repayment period is 1.5 percent of \nthe outstanding balance at the time of the last advance during the draw period. Under proposed comment \n5b(c)(9)(i)-1.ii.A, a creditor must disclose that the length of the plan and the length of the repayment period are \ndetermined by the size of the outstanding balance at the time of the last advance during the draw period.\n\n\n\nThe second illustration would assume that the length of the draw period is 10 years and the length of the repayment \nperiod will be 15 years if the balance at the beginning of the repayment period is less than $ 20,000, and 30 years if \nthe balance is $ 20,000 or more. Under proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(i)-1.ii.B, a creditor must disclose that the length \nof the plan will be 25 or 40 years depending on the outstanding balance at the beginning of the repayment period. \nIn addition, the creditor must disclose that the repayment period will be 15 years if the balance is less than $ \n20,000, and 30 years if the balance is $ 20,000 or more. This proposed comment provides that a creditor must not \nsimply disclose that the repayment period is determined by the size of the balance. Guidance on how to disclose \nthe information in this illustration is found in proposed Sample G--14(E) in Appendix G.\n\nThe Board requests comment on whether additional guidance is needed on how to disclose the length of the \nHELOC plan and the length of the repayment period in the table where the plan does not have a maturity date and \nthe length of the repayment period cannot be determined at the time the early HELOC disclosures must be given.\n\nLength of draw period is indefinite. Current comment 5b(d)(5)(i)-1 provides that if the length of the plan is indefinite \n(for example, because there is no time limit on the period during which the consumer can take advances), the \ncreditor must state that fact in the application disclosures when disclosing the length of the draw period. The Board \nproposes to move this provision from current comment 5b(d)(5)(i)-1 to proposed comment 5b(d)(9)(i)-1.iii. Thus, \nunder the proposal, a creditor would be required to make this disclosure in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures, to satisfy the requirement in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i) to disclose the length of the plan and the length \nof the draw period. The Board requests comment on whether additional guidance is needed on how to disclose the \nlength of the plan and the length of draw period in the table when the length of the draw period is indefinite.\n\nLength of the plan and length of the draw period are the same. For some HELOC plans, the length of the plan and \nthe length of the draw period are the same because the HELOC plan does not have a repayment period. For \nexample, some HELOC plans offer a payment plan where a consumer would only be required to pay interest during \nthe draw period. At the end of the draw period, the consumer would be required to pay the principal balance as a \nballoon payment. Proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(i)-4 provides that if the length of the plan and the length of the draw \nperiod are the same, a creditor will be deemed to satisfy the requirement to disclose the length of plan by disclosing \nthe length of the draw period.\n\nNo repayment period on the HELOC plan. Under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i), if there is no repayment period on the \nHELOC plan, a creditor would be required to include a statement in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures that after the draw period ends, the consumer must repay the remaining balance in full. Pursuant to its \nauthority under TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, the Board proposes to \nadd this disclosure to make more clear to consumers that there is no repayment period on the HELOC being \noffered. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14).\n\nDraw period renewal provisions. Current comment 5b(d)(5)(i)-2 provides that if, under the credit agreement, a \ncreditor retains the right to review a line at the end of the draw period and determine whether to renew or extend the \ndraw period of the plan, the possibility of renewal or extension--regardless of its likelihood--should be ignored for \nthe application disclosures. For example, if an agreement provides that the draw period is five years and that the \ncreditor may renew the draw period for an additional five years, the possibility of renewal should be ignored and the \ndraw period should be considered five years. The Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment \n5b(c)(9)(i)-2, and apply it to the early HELOC disclosures.\n\nParagraphs 5b(c)(9)(ii) and (c)(9)(iii)\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(8)(C) and (a)(10), provides that a creditor must \ndisclose as part of the application disclosures an explanation of how the minimum periodic payments will be \ndetermined and the timing of the payments (such as whether the payments will be due monthly, quarterly or on \nsome other periodic basis). 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(8)(C) and (a)(10). In addition, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) provides \nthat if paying only the minimum periodic payments may not repay any of the principal or may repay less than the \noutstanding balance, the creditor must disclose a statement of this fact, as well as a statement that a balloon \n\n\n\npayment may result. Footnote 10b explains that a balloon payment results if paying the minimum periodic payments \ndoes not fully amortize the outstanding balance by a specified date or time, and the consumer must repay the entire \noutstanding balance at that time.\n\nUnder current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(9), a creditor must disclose as part of the \napplication disclosures an example, based on a $ 10,000 outstanding balance and a recent APR, of the minimum \nperiodic payments, the amount of any balloon payment, and the time it would take to repay the $ 10,000 \noutstanding balance if the consumer made only those payments and obtained no additional extensions of credit. 15 \nU.S.C. 1637a(a)(9). In addition, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(H), provides \nthat for each payment option offered on a variable-rate HELOC plan, a creditor must disclose the minimum periodic \npayments that would be required if the maximum APR were in effect for a $ 10,000 outstanding balance. 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(a)(2)(H).\n\nAs discussed in more detail below, the Board proposes to move the provisions in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and to revise them. The Board also proposes to move the provisions in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and \n(d)(12)(x) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) and to revise them. In addition, the Board proposes to move the contents \nof footnote 10b to proposed comment 5b(c)(9)-1.\n\nMultiple payment plans. In some cases, creditors may offer more than one payment option on a HELOC plan. For \nexample, a creditor may provide the following two payment options during the draw period: (1) minimum monthly \npayments during the draw period will cover only interest that accrues each month and will not pay down any of the \nprincipal balance; or (2) minimum monthly payments during the draw period will cover interest that accrues each \nmonth plus 1.5 percent of the principle balance each month. The Board understands that creditors typically do not \nrequire a consumer to choose the payment plan he or she wants when applying for a HELOC plan, but instead \nrequire the consumer to choose a payment plan either prior to or at account opening.\n\nUnder current comment 5b(a)(1)-4, a creditor may provide a single application disclosure form for all of its HELOC \nplans, as long as the disclosure describes all aspects of the plans. For example, if the creditor offers several \npayment options, all such options generally must be disclosed, including fixed-rate and -term payment features, as \ndiscussed in more detail above in the section-by-section analysis to \u00a7 226.5b(c). See also current comment \n5b(d)(5)(ii)-2. Alternatively, a creditor has the option of providing separate disclosure forms for multiple options or \nvariations in features. For example, a creditor that offers two payment options for the draw period may prepare \nseparate disclosure forms for the two payment options. A creditor using this alternative, however, must include a \nstatement on each application disclosure form that the consumer should ask about the creditor's other HELOC \nprograms. A creditor that receives a request for information about other available programs prior to account opening \nmust provide the additional disclosures as soon as reasonably possible.\n\nAs discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2), the Board proposes to delete current \ncomment 5b(a)(1)-4 as obsolete. Under the proposal, a creditor would not be allowed to disclose more than two \npayment options offered on the HELOC in the table. Specifically, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B), if a creditor \nonly offers two payment plans (excluding fixed-rate and -term payment plans unless these are the only payment \nplans offered during the draw period), the creditor would be required to disclose both of those payment plans in the \ntable. If a creditor offers more than two payment plans (excluding fixed-rate and -term payment plans unless these \nare the only payment plans offered during the draw period), the creditor would be allowed to disclose only two of the \npayment plans in the table. See proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-2. Proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-2 clarifies that the \nfollowing would be considered two payment plans: The draw period is 10 years and the consumer has the choice \nbetween two repayment periods--10 and 20 years. The two payment plans would be (1) a 10 year draw period and \na 10 year repayment period, and (2) a 10 year draw period and a 20 year repayment period.\n\nThe Board believes that the proposed approach of allowing only two payment plans to be disclosed in the table \nwould benefit consumers by preventing \"information overload\" that might result if more than two payment options \nwere disclosed in the table. In addition, the Board believes that requiring a creditor to disclose two payment plans in \nthe table, instead of allowing the creditor to disclose each payment plan separately to the consumer, would benefit \n\n\n\nconsumers by enabling consumers more easily to compare the two payment plans. As discussed in more detail \nbelow, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii), a creditor would be required to disclose sample payments for each \npayment plan disclosed in the table based on the assumption that the consumer borrows the full credit line at \naccount opening, and does not obtain any additional extensions of credit. Under the proposal, if a creditor is \ndisclosing two payment plans in the table, the creditor would be required to disclose in the table which plan results \nin the least amount of interest, and which plan results in the most amount of interest, based on the assumptions \nused to calculate the sample payments. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(3). In addition, under the proposal, a \ncreditor disclosing two payment plans in the table, one in which a balloon payment would occur and one in which it \nwould not, must disclose that a balloon payment will result for the plan in which a balloon payment would occur and \nthat a balloon payment will not result for the plan in which no balloon payment would occur. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4). In consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested the \nabove disclosures explicitly comparing two payment plans; most participants responding to questions about this \ninformation indicated that they found this information useful.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B) also provides that if a creditor offers one or more payment plans (excluding fixed-rate \nand -term payment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period) where a \nconsumer would repay all of the principal by the end of the plan if the consumer makes only the minimum payments \ndue during that period, the creditor would be required to describe one of these payment plans in the table. For \nexample, if a creditor offers two payment plans where a balloon payment will result and one payment plan \n(excluding fixed-rate and -term payment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw \nperiod) where a balloon payment will not result, the creditor would be required to disclose in the table two payments \nplans, one of which must be the plan where a balloon payment will not result.\n\nIn consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested versions of early HELOC \ndisclosures where two payment plans were shown in the table--one payment plan that would result in a balloon \npayment and one payment plan that would not result in a balloon payment. In this consumer testing, participants \nwere asked which of these payment plans they would be likely to choose if they were opening the HELOC plan. \nMost of the participants indicated that they would choose the payment plan without the balloon payment because, in \npart, they did not want to owe a balloon payment at the end of the plan. Thus, the Board believes that requiring a \ncreditor to disclose in the table a payment plan where a balloon will not result (if such a plan is offered by the \ncreditor) would benefit consumers by informing them that the creditor offers such a payment plan.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B) also requires a creditor to include a statement in the table indicating that the table \nshows how the creditor determines minimum required payments for two plans offered by the creditor. If the creditor \noffers more than the two payment plans described in the table (other than fixed-rate and -term payment plans \nunless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period), the creditor would be required to disclose \nthat other payment plans are available, and that the consumer should ask the creditor for additional details about \nthese other payment plans. Proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-3 clarifies that this statement about additional payment \nplans would be required only if the creditor offers additional payment plans available to the consumer. If the only \nother payment plans available are employee preferred-rate plans, for example, the creditor would be required to \nprovide this statement only if the consumer would qualify for the employee preferred-rate plan.\n\nProposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-5 provides guidance on how a creditor must provide additional information on other \npayment plans to a consumer upon the consumer's request prior to account opening. This proposed comment \nprovides that if a creditor offers a payment plan other than the two payment plans disclosed in the table as part of \nthe early HELOC disclosures (except for fixed-rate and -term payment plans unless those are the only payment \nplans offered during the draw period), and a consumer requests additional information about the other plan, the \ncreditor must disclose an additional table under \u00a7 226.5b(b) to the consumer with the terms of the other payment \nplan described in the table. See proposed comment 5(c)(18)-2 for disclosure of additional information about fixed-\nrate and -term payment plans upon a consumer's request. If the creditor offers multiple payment plans that were not \ndisclosed in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures, the creditor would be allowed to disclose only one \npayment plan on each additional table given to the consumer. Under the proposal, for example, if a creditor offers \ntwo payment plans (other than fixed-rate and -term payment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered \n\n\n\nduring the draw period) that were not disclosed in the table given as part of the early HELOC disclosures, the \ncreditor would be required to provide the consumer, upon request, two additional tables--one table for each \npayment plan. A creditor that receives a request for information about other available payment plans prior to \naccount opening would be required to provide the additional information as soon as reasonably possible after the \nrequest. See proposed comment 5b(c)-2.\n\nThe Board believes that this proposed approach of only allowing two payment plans to be disclosed in the table, \nand allowing the consumer easily and quickly to receive information about additional payment plans upon request, \nstrikes the proper balance between ensuring that consumers are adequately informed about the payment plans that \nare offered on the HELOC plan and preventing \"information overload\" that might result if all payment plans were \ndisclosed in the table. The Board solicits comment on the proposed approach.\n\nMinimum payment requirements. As discussed above, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) provides that a creditor must \ndisclose as part of the application disclosures an explanation of how the minimum periodic payment will be \ndetermined and the timing of the payments (such as whether the payments will be due monthly, quarterly or on \nsome other periodic basis). The Board proposes to move the provisions in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and to revise them. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A) provides that if a creditor offers to the \nconsumer only one payment plan (except for fixed-rate and -term payment plans unless those are the only payment \nplans offered during the draw period), the creditor must disclose in the table an explanation of how the minimum \nperiodic payment will be determined and the timing of the payments. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B) provides that a \ncreditor disclosing two payment plans in the table would be required to provide an explanation of how the minimum \npayment will be determined for both payment plans and the timing of the payments.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-1 provides that the disclosure of how the minimum periodic payment is determined \nneed describe only the principal and interest components of the payment. A creditor, at its option, may disclose \nother charges that may be a part of the payment, as well as the balance computation method. The Board proposes \nto move this comment to proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-1 and revise it. Specifically, proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-\n1 provides that the disclosure of how the minimum periodic payment is determined in the early HELOC disclosures \ntable must describe only the principal and interest components of the payment.\n\nUnlike current comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-1, however, proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-1 would not allow a creditor to \ndisclose in the table other charges that may be a part of the payment or the balance computation method. In \naddition, under proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-1, a creditor would not be allowed to disclose in the table a \ndescription of any floor payment amount, where the payment will not go below that amount. The Board believes that \nallowing charges that may be part of the payment (other than principal and interest components), the balance \ncomputation method, and any payment floor amount to be disclosed in the table might create \"information overload\" \nfor consumers. The Board believes that the proposed approach to allow creditors to disclose information only about \nthe principle and interest components of the payment in the table strikes the proper balance between informing \nconsumers about how minimum periodic payments will be determined, and preventing the \"information overload\" \nthat may result if other details were included. The concern about \"information overload\" here is that consumers will \neither not read the disclosure or not understand or retain the information they do read.\n\nPayment examples. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application \ndisclosures an example, based on a $ 10,000 outstanding balance and a recent APR, showing the minimum \nperiodic payments, the amount of any balloon payment, and the time it would take to repay the $ 10,000 \noutstanding balance if the consumer made only those payments and obtained no additional extensions of credit. 15 \nU.S.C. 1637a(a)(9). To fulfill this disclosure requirement, a creditor must disclose the number and amount of the \nminimum periodic payments and the amount of any balloon payment, assuming the consumer borrows $ 10,000 at \nthe beginning of the draw period at a recent APR and the outstanding balance is reduced according to the terms of \nthe plan. A creditor must assume no additional advances are taken at any time, including at the beginning of any \nrepayment period. See current comment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-3.\n\n\n\nA creditor must disclose separate hypothetical payments (or ranges of payments) for the draw period and the \nrepayment period, if minimum periodic payments are calculated differently for the two periods. See current \ncomment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-3. In this case, the highest payment in the range of payments for the draw period would be \nbased on a $ 10,000 balance. The highest payment in the range of payment for the repayment period would be \nbased on the outstanding balance at the beginning of the repayment period, which is calculated on the assumptions \nthat the consumer borrows $ 10,000 at the beginning of the draw period, the consumer makes only minimum \npayments during the draw period, and the APR does not change during the draw period. Footnote 10c and \ncomment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-1 provide guidance on selecting a recent APR to calculate the hypothetical payment schedule \nunder current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii). In disclosing the hypothetical payment schedule, if the amount of the hypothetical \npayments may vary within the draw period, or any repayment period, a creditor may disclose the hypothetical \npayments as a range of payments. See current Home Equity Samples G--14A and G--14B in Appendix G.\n\nUnder current comment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-2, a creditor may show a hypothetical payment schedule either for each \npayment plan disclosed in the application disclosures, or for representative payment plans. This comment also \nprovides guidance how a creditor should choose representative payment plans. Current Home Equity Samples G--\n14A and G--14B, and Home Equity Model Clauses G--15 in Appendix G provide model language for how to \ndisclose the hypothetical payment schedule required by current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii).\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x) provides that for variable-rate HELOC plans, a creditor must disclose, as part of the \napplication disclosures for each payment option offered on the HELOC, the minimum periodic payment that would \nbe required if the maximum APR were in effect for a $ 10,000 outstanding balance. 15 U.S.C. Unlike the payment \nexamples required under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) for a recent rate, the payment examples required under current \n\u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x) for the maximum rate do not require the creditor to disclose a hypothetical payment schedule \nbased on the maximum APR. Instead, under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x), a creditor is required only to show the \nminimum required payments if the consumer had a $ 10,000 balance during the draw period at the maximum APR, \nand the minimum required payments if the consumer had a $ 10,000 balance at the beginning of the repayment \nperiod at the maximum APR, assuming the minimum required payments are calculated differently in the two \nperiods. (If minimum required payments are calculated the same in the two periods, only one payment example \nneed be shown.) See comment 5b(d)(12)(x)-1. Even if a consumer might owe a balloon payment at the end of the \nHELOC, a creditor would not need to disclose the amount of the balloon payment based on the maximum APR. As \nwith the payment examples required under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) that are based on a recent APR, a creditor \nmay provide the hypothetical payments based on the maximum APR either for each payment plan disclosed in the \napplication disclosures, or for representative payment plans. See current comment 5b(d)(12)(x)-1. Current Home \nEquity Samples G--14A and G--14B and Home Equity Model Clauses G--15 in Appendix G provide model language \nfor how to disclose the payment examples required by current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x).\n\nThe Board proposes to move the provisions on payment examples in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12)(x) to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(iii) and to revise them. The Board proposes to streamline the payment examples for the current APR \nand the maximum APR so they are calculated in a consistent manner. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its \nauthority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the \nstatute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers \navoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(B), a creditor \nwould be required to provide payment examples for the current and maximum APR for each payment plan \ndisclosed in the table. These payment examples would show the first minimum periodic payment for the draw \nperiod and the first minimum periodic payment for any repayment period, and the balance outstanding at the \nbeginning of any repayment period, based on the following assumptions: (1) The consumer borrows the maximum \ncredit line available (as disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures) at account opening, and does not obtain any \nadditional extensions of credit; (2) the consumer makes only minimum periodic payments during the draw period \nand any repayment period; and (3) the APRs used to calculate the sample payments remain the same during the \ndraw period and any repayment period. Unlike the payment examples in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), which must be \nbased on a recent APR, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) would require payment examples based on the maximum APR \npossible for the plan, as well as the current APR offered to the consumer on the HELOC plan. Under the proposal, if \nan introductory APR applies, a creditor would be required to use the APR that would otherwise apply to the plan \n\n\n\nafter the introductory APR expires, as described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(ii). Thus, the Board proposes to delete \nthe contents of footnote 10c and guidance in current 5b(d)(5)(iii)-1 that relate to selecting a recent APR.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) also requires additional disclosures as part of the proposed payment examples. \nSpecifically, a creditor would be required to disclose the following information: (1) A statement that the payment \nexamples show the first periodic payments at the current and maximum APRs if the consumer borrows the \nmaximum credit available when the account is opened and does not borrow any more money; (2) a statement that \nthe payment examples are not the consumer's actual payments and that the actual payments each period will \ndepend on the amount that the consumer has borrowed and the interest rate that period; (3) if a creditor is \ndisclosing two payment plans in the table, the creditor must identify which plan results in the least amount of \ninterest, and which plan results in the most amount of interest, based on the assumptions used to calculate the \npayment examples described above; and (4) if a consumer may pay a balloon payment under a payment plan \ndisclosed in the table, the creditor must disclose that fact, and the amount of the balloon payment based on the \nassumptions used to calculate the payment examples described above. If a creditor is disclosing two payment plans \nin the table, one in which a balloon payment would occur and one in which it would not, a creditor must disclose that \na balloon payment will not result for the plan in which no balloon payment would occur. The Board also proposes in \nnew \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(D) to require a creditor to provide the new payment examples and the other related \ninformation in a tabular format substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables found in \nSamples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G.\n\nAs noted, the proposed payment examples for the current and the maximum APRs would be based on the \nassumption that the consumer borrows the maximum credit available (as disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures) \nat account opening, and does not obtain any additional extensions of credit. The Board proposes not to use $ \n10,000 as the hypothetical balance for calculating the payment examples because of concerns that using that \nbalance makes the sample payments unrealistically low for most consumers. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Consumers \ntypically may borrow more than $ 10,000 on their HELOC plans. To illustrate, the Board's 2007 Survey of \nConsumer Finances data indicates that the median outstanding balance on HELOCs (for families that had a \nbalance at the time of the interview) was $ 24,000. 18\n\nThe Board believes that the proposed payment examples based on the maximum credit available for the current \nand maximum APRs will provide more useful information to consumers than the existing $ 10,000 example. \nDisclosing the first required minimum payment for the draw period if the consumer borrows the maximum credit \navailable at the current APR would provide the consumer with an estimate of the actual current payment if the \nconsumer borrows the maximum credit available at account opening. Disclosing the first required minimum \npayment for the draw period if the consumer borrowers the maximum credit available at the maximum APR would \nshow the consumer a \"worst case scenario\" payment. In consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC \ndisclosures, the Board tested versions of the early HELOC disclosures that based the payment examples on a $ \n10,000 hypothetical balance, and other versions of the disclosures that based the payment examples on the \nmaximum credit line. In this testing, a number of participants preferred payment examples based on the maximum \ncredit line, indicating that they would like to know what would be the highest payment they would have to make if \nthey borrowed the entire credit limit.\n\nThe proposed payment examples also would show the first minimum periodic payment during the repayment \nperiod for both the current and maximum APRs. These payment examples would be based on the balance \n\n18 Brian Bucks,et al., Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances, \nFederal Reserve Bulletin (February 20091.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\noutstanding at the beginning of the repayment period, assuming that the consumer borrows the full credit line at the \nbeginning of draw period, the consumer makes only minimum required payments during the draw period and \nborrows no additional money, and the APR does change during the draw period. Under the proposal, the amount of \nthe balance used to calculate the first minimum periodic payment during the repayment period would be disclosed \nin the table. The Board recognizes that the first payments during the repayment period may be less useful to the \nconsumer than the first payments during the draw period, given that the first payments during the repayment \nperiods are based on the assumptions that the consumer will not take any additional advances during the draw \nperiod and the APR will not change during the draw period. Nonetheless, for some plans the required minimum \nperiodic payments in the repayment period may be considerably larger than the required minimum periodic \npayments during the draw period. For example, some HELOCs offer a payment plan in which the minimum periodic \npayments during the draw period cover only interest and do not pay down any of the principal during the draw \nperiod, but during the repayment period, minimum periodic payments cover interest and at least some of the \nprincipal balance. In these plans, the required minimum periodic payments during the repayment period could be \nconsiderably larger than the minimum periodic payments during the draw period. The Board believes that showing \nthe first required minimum periodic payment for the repayment period will better protect consumers by putting them \non notice that their payments for the repayment period may be much larger than the minimum periodic payments for \nthe draw period.\n\nUnlike current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) would not require a creditor to disclose a full \nhypothetical payment schedule in the early HELOC disclosures. Instead, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) requires a \ncreditor to disclose only the first minimum periodic payment during the draw period and the first minimum periodic \npayment during any repayment period. The Board proposes to delete the requirement to provide the number of \nhypothetical payments and the range of those payments during the draw period and any repayment period because \nof concerns that including that information in the table may confuse consumers and detract from other important \ninformation. In the consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested versions of \nthe early HELOC disclosures that showed a range of payments for the draw period and the repayment period. In \nthis testing, many participants did not understand why the payments during the draw period and the repayment \nperiod were shown as a range. In addition, participants spent considerable time attempting to understand the range \nof payments at the expense of not focusing on other pertinent information on the disclosure forms.\n\nIn addition, the Board believes that showing only the first payments for the draw period and the repayment period \nsufficiently informs consumers about how large the payments could be under the payment plans. If the range of \npayments were shown for the draw period, the first payment for the draw period would be the highest payment in \nthat range. Likewise, if a range of payments were shown for the repayment period, the first payment for the \nrepayment period would be the highest payment in the range.\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5(d)(5)(iii) also requires that a creditor disclose the time it would take to repay a $ 10,000 advance \nthat is taken at the beginning of the draw period at a recent rate and is reduced according to the terms of the plan. \nThe Board proposes not to include the \"time to repay\" disclosure in the early HELOC disclosures. The Board \nproposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the \nrequirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare \ncredit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). In \nconsumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested versions of the early HELOC \ndisclosures that contained two payment options. In disclosing the payment examples for each payment option, the \nforms contained a disclosure of the time it would take to repay the hypothetical balance if the consumer only made \nminimum periodic payments. Although a few participants cited the \"time to repay\" as a reason to choose one \npayment plan over another, the Board is concerned that if a creditor discloses two payment options in the table, the \ntime to repay each plan would not always be an accurate measure of which payment plan is better for consumers. \nThe Board believes requiring the \"time to repay\" disclosure in the table may distract consumers from considering \nother information in the table that may be more useful in comparing the two payment plans--namely the disclosures \nof which payment plan results in the least amount of interest and whether a plan has a balloon payment.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Board understands that most HELOCs have a maturity date and a definite length for the plan. For \nthese HELOCs, the time to repay the balance will be the same as the length of the plan (which must be disclosed in \nthe early HELOC disclosures, see proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i)), unless the HELOC plan has a floor payment amount \n(which may cause the principal to be paid off earlier than the maturity date). Even if the plan has a floor payment \namount, the length of the plan will inform consumers of the \"worst case scenario\" of how long it will take to repay \nthe debt if only minimum periodic payments are made.\n\nUnder current comments 5b(d)(5)(iii)-2 and 5b(d)(12)(x)-1, a creditor may show the hypothetical payment examples \nrequired to be disclosed under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12)(x) either for each payment plan disclosed in \nthe application disclosures, or for representative payment plans. The Board proposes to delete these comments. \nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii), a creditor would be required to disclose the proposed payment examples (as \ndescribed above) for each payment plan disclosed in the table.\n\nThe current model clauses for disclosing the payment examples under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12)(x) are \ncontained in current G--15 in Appendix G. These model clauses provide this information in a narrative format. The \nBoard proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(D) to require a creditor to provide the proposed payment examples and \nthe other related information in a tabular format that is substantially similar to the format used in any of the \napplicable tables found in proposed Samples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G. In the consumer \ntesting conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested versions of the early HELOC disclosures \nwhere the proposed payment examples and related information were presented in the tabular format shown in \nproposed Samples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G. This testing showed that presenting this \ninformation in a tabular format more effectively communicated payment information to participants than the current \nnarrative format.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-1 provides guidance to creditors on how to calculate the hypothetical payment \nschedule required to be disclosed under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii). Specifically, current comment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-1 \nprovides that the creditor may assume that the credit limit as well as the outstanding balance is $ 10,000. (If the \ncreditor only offers lines of credit for less than $ 10,000, however, the creditor may assume an outstanding balance \nof $ 5,000 instead of $ 10,000 in making this disclosure.) The example should reflect the payment comprised only of \nprincipal and interest. Creditors may provide an additional example reflecting other charges that may be included in \nthe payment, such as credit insurance premiums. Creditors may assume that all months have an equal number of \ndays, that payments are collected in whole cents, and that payments will fall on a business day even though they \nmay be due on a non-business day. For variable-rate plans, the example must be based on the last rate in the \nhistorical example table required in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xi), or a more recent rate. Where the last rate shown in \nthe historical example table is different from the index value and margin (for example, due to a rate cap), creditors \nshould calculate the rate by using the index value and margin. A discounted rate may not be considered a more \nrecent rate in calculating this payment example for either variable- or fixed-rate plans.\n\nThe Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(iii)-1 and revise it Current guidance in \ncomment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-1 related to the hypothetical $ 10,000 balance and selecting a recent APR would be deleted \nas obsolete. Unlike current comment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-1, proposed comment 5b(d)(9)(iii)-1 would not allow a creditor to \nprovide additional payment examples reflecting other charges that may be included in the payment, such as credit \ninsurance premiums, because of concerns that allowing these additional payment examples would be more \ninformation than many consumers can effectively process and may discourage consumers from reviewing the \npayment examples at all.\n\nThe Board also proposes to include in proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(iii)-1 additional guidance for calculating and \ndisclosing the proposed payment examples in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii). Specifically, proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(iii)-1 \nprovides that in calculating the payment examples, a creditor must account for any significant terms related to each \npayment plan, such as payment caps or payment floor amounts. A creditor must take payment floor amounts into \naccount when calculating the payment examples even though the creditor is not permitted to disclose that payment \nfloor in the table when describing how minimum payments will be calculated. See proposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-1. \nFor example, assume that under a payment plan, the monthly payment for the draw period will be calculated as the \n\n\n\ninterest accrued during that month, or $ 50, whichever is greater. In the early HELOC disclosures table, a creditor \nwould be required to disclose that the minimum monthly payment during the draw period only covers interest. The \ncreditor would not be allowed to disclose the payment floor of $ 50 in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures. Nonetheless, the creditor would be required to take into account this $ 50 payment floor in calculating \nthe disclosures shown as part of the payment examples.\n\nIn disclosing the payment examples, a creditor would be required to assume that the consumer borrows the full \ncredit line (as disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures) at the beginning of the draw period and that this advance \nis reduced according to the terms of the plan. The proposed comment provides that a creditor must not assume that \nan additional advance is taken at any time, including at the beginning of any repayment period. The examples also \nwould be required to reflect the payment comprised only of principal and interest. The proposed sample payments \nin the table showing the first minimum periodic payment for the draw period and any repayment period, as well as \nthe balance outstanding at the beginning of any repayment period, must be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. \nThe proposed comment provides that creditors may assume that all months have an equal number of days, that \npayments are collected in whole cents, and that payments will fall on a business day even though they may be due \non a non-business day. A creditor would be required to assume that the APR used to calculate each payment \nexample required by \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) would remain the same during the draw period and any repayment period as \nspecified in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(A)(3) even if that APR is a variable rate under the plan.\n\nBalloon payments. Currently, if a balloon payment may be paid by the consumer under a payment plan, creditors \nare required to make two disclosures relating to the balloon payment.\n\nFirst, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(10), provides that if paying only the \nminimum periodic payments may not repay any of the principal or may repay less than the outstanding balance, the \ncreditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures a statement of this fact, as well as a statement that a \nballoon payment may result. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(10). Footnote 10b explains that a balloon payment results if paying \nthe minimum periodic payments does not fully amortize the outstanding balance by a specified date or time, and the \nconsumer must repay the entire outstanding balance at such time. Current comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-3 provides \nguidance about disclosing balloon payments in the application disclosures. This comment provides that in programs \nwhere the occurrence of a balloon payment is possible, a creditor must disclose the possibility of a balloon payment \neven if such a payment is uncertain or unlikely. This comment also provides that in programs where a balloon \npayment will occur, such as programs with interest-only payments during the draw period and no repayment period, \nthe disclosures must state that a balloon payment will result. Current comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-3 clarifies that in making \nthe disclosure about a balloon payment as required by \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii), a creditor is not required to use the term \n\"balloon payment\" and is not required to disclose the amount of the balloon payment. In addition, this comment \nclarifies that the balloon payment disclosure as described in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) does not apply in cases where \nrepayment of the entire outstanding balance would occur only as a result of termination and acceleration, or if the \nfinal payment could not be more than twice the amount of other minimum payments under the plan.\n\nSecond, as discussed above, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) requires disclosure of a hypothetical payment schedule, \nbased on a $ 10,000 outstanding balance and a recent APR, showing the minimum periodic payments, the amount \nof any balloon payment, and the time it would take to repay the $ 10,000 outstanding balance if the consumer made \nonly those payments and obtained no additional extensions of credit.\n\n1. Disclosure of balloon payments when one payment plan is disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures. Under the \nproposal, if a creditor is only disclosing one payment plan in the early HELOC disclosures and under that payment \nplan the consumer may pay a balloon payment, a creditor would be required to disclose information about the \nballoon payment twice in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures: At the beginning of the information about \npayment terms, and as part of the payment examples. The Board proposes to move the provisions on disclosing a \nballoon payment in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A).\n\nSpecifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A) provides that if a creditor offers to the consumer only one payment plan \n(except for fixed-rate and -term payment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw \n\n\n\nperiod) and paying only the minimum periodic payments may not repay any of the principal or may repay less than \nthe outstanding balance by the end of the HELOC plan, the creditor must disclose a statement of this fact, as well \nas a statement that a balloon payment may result. Proposed comment 5b(c)(9)-2 explains that the row \"Balloon \nPayment\" in the \"Borrowing and Repayment Terms\" section of proposed Sample G--14(D) in Appendix G provides \nguidance on how to comply with the requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A). Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A) \nalso specifies that if a balloon payment will not result under the payment plan, a creditor must not disclose in the \nearly HELOC disclosures the fact that a balloon payment will not result for the plan. The Board believes that \nallowing a creditor to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures table that a balloon payment will not result for the \nplan might create \"information overload\" for consumers and distract consumers from more important information in \nthe table because consumers are not likely to understand a statement that \"a balloon payment will not apply\" \nwithout additional language defining what a balloon payment is, which would add complexity to the table.\n\nIn addition, as discussed above, the Board proposes to move the payment examples in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) to \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) and revise them. Regarding disclosure of the amount of the balloon payment in the \nproposed payment examples, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4) provides that if a consumer may pay a balloon \npayment under a payment plan disclosed in the table, a creditor would be required to disclose that fact when \ndisclosing the proposed payment examples, as well as disclose the amount of the balloon payment based on the \nassumptions used the calculate the payment examples as described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii). Proposed \ncomment 5b(c)(9)-2 explains that the first paragraph of the \"Sample Payments\" section of proposed Sample G--\n14(D) in Appendix G provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4). \nConsistent with proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A), proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4) also specifies that if a creditor is \ndisclosing only one payment plan in early HELOC disclosures, and a balloon payment will not occur for that plan, \nthe creditor must not disclose as part of the payment examples that a balloon payment will not result for the plan.\n\nThe Board proposes to move current comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-3 and current footnote 10b, which provide guidance on \ndisclosing balloon payments, to proposed comment 5b(c)(9)-1 and to revise these provisions. Like current footnote \n10b, proposed comment 5b(c)(9)-1 specifies that a balloon payment results if paying the minimum periodic \npayments does not fully amortize the outstanding balance by a specified date or time, and the consumer must \nrepay the entire outstanding balance at such time. A creditor also would not need to make a disclosure about \nballoon payments if the final payment could not be more than twice the amount of other minimum payments under \nthe plan. Consistent with current comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-3, proposed comment 5b(c)(9)-1 specifies that the balloon \npayment disclosures in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and (iii) do not apply where repayment of the entire outstanding \nbalance would occur only as a result of termination and acceleration.\n\nFinally, consistent with current comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-3, proposed comment 5b(c)(9)-1 specifies that, in disclosing a \nballoon payment under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and (iii), a creditor must disclose that a balloon payment \"may\" result if a \nballoon payment under a payment plan is possible, even if such a payment is uncertain or unlikely; a creditor must \ndisclose a balloon payment \"will\" result if a balloon payment will occur under a payment plan, such as a payment \nplan with interest-only payments during the draw period and no repayment period.\n\n2. Disclosure of balloon payments when two payment plans are disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures. Under \nthe proposal, a creditor that discloses two payment plans in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures and \nunder at least one of the plans a consumer may pay a balloon payment, the creditor must disclose information \nabout the balloon payment three times in the table: (1) At the beginning of information about the payment terms on \nthe HELOC plan; (2) with a discussion of how the minimum periodic payments are determined for each plan; and \n(3) with the payment examples.\n\nFirst, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(1) provides that if a creditor is disclosing two payment options in the table and \nunder at least one of the payment plans, paying only the minimum periodic payments may not repay any of the \nprincipal or may repay less than the outstanding balance by the end of the plan, a creditor must disclose in the table \nas part of the early HELOC disclosures a statement of this fact, as well as a statement that a balloon payment may \nresult. If a balloon payment would result under one payment plan but not both payment plans, the creditor must \ndisclose that a balloon payment may result depending on the terms of the payment plan. If a balloon payment would \n\n\n\nresult under both payment plans, the creditor must disclose that a balloon payment will result. If a balloon payment \nwould not result under both payment plans, a creditor must not disclose in the early HELOC disclosures the fact \nthat a balloon payment will not result for both plans. As noted above with respect to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A), \nthe Board believes that allowing a creditor to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures table that a balloon payment \nwill not result for the both payment plans might create \"information overload\" for consumers and distract consumers \nfrom more important information in the table. Proposed comment 5b(c)(9)-3 explains that the row \"Balloon \nPayment\" in the \"Borrowing and Repayment Terms\" section of proposed Sample G--14(C) in Appendix G provides \nguidance on how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(1).\n\nSecond, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(3), for each payment plan described in the early HELOC disclosures \nfor which a balloon payment may result (or will result as applicable), a creditor would be required to disclose that a \nballoon payment may result or will result, as applicable, for that plan. For example, assume a creditor describes two \npayment plans--Plan A and Plan B--in the early HELOC disclosures, and a balloon payment will result for both \nplans. Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose that a balloon payment will result for Plan A and \ndisclose that a balloon payment will result for Plan B. These two statements would be disclosed along with the \ninformation about how minimum payments would be calculated for each plan required under proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(2). See the rows \"Plan A\" and \"Plan B\" in the \"Payment Plans\" section of proposed Sample G--\n14(C) in Appendix G.\n\nIf one of the plans has a balloon payment and the other does not, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(3) requires a \ncreditor to disclose that a balloon payment will result for the plan in which a balloon payment will occur and that a \nballoon payment will not result for the plan in which no balloon payment would occur. If under Plan A, a consumer \nwould pay a balloon payment while under Plan B a consumer would not pay a balloon payment, the creditor would \nbe required to state that a balloon payment will result for Plan A and a statement that a balloon payment will not \nresult for Plan B. Again, these two statements would be disclosed along with the information about how minimum \npayments would be calculated for each plan required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(2). Consistent with \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(1), proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(3) also specifies that if neither payment plan has a \nballoon payment, a creditor must not disclose the fact that a balloon payment will not result for the each plan.\n\nThird, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4) provides that if a consumer may pay a balloon payment under a payment \nplan disclosed in the table, a creditor would be required to disclose that fact when disclosing the proposed payment \nexamples, and disclose the amount of the balloon payment based on the assumptions used the calculate the \npayment examples as described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii). If under both Plan A and Plan B a consumer would \nowe a balloon payment, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(4) requires a creditor to disclose that a balloon payment will \nresult for Plan A and disclose the amount of the balloon payment based on the assumptions used to calculate the \npayment examples described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii). In addition, a creditor would be required to disclose a \nballoon payment will result for Plan B and the amount of the balloon payment. These two statements would be \ndisclosed along with the payment examples in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii). See the \"Plan A vs. Plan B\" part of the \n\"Plan Comparison\" section of proposed Sample G--14(C) in Appendix G.\n\nIf one of the plans has a balloon payment and the other does not, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4) requires a \ncreditor to disclose that a balloon payment will not result for the plan in which no balloon payment would occur. In \nother words, if under Plan A, a consumer would pay a balloon payment while under Plan B a consumer would not \npay a balloon payment, the creditor would be required to disclose a statement that a balloon payment will result for \nPlan A and the amount of the balloon payment. In addition, a creditor would be required to disclose a statement that \na balloon payment will not result for Plan B. These two statements would be disclosed along with the payment \nexamples in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii). Consistent with proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(1), proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4) also specifies that if neither payment plan has a balloon payment, a creditor must not disclose \nthe fact that a balloon payment will not result for the each plan. Thus, if under both Plan A and Plan B a consumer \nwould not owe a balloon payment, a creditor must not disclose in the early HELOC disclosures that a balloon \npayment would not be paid under either plan.\n\n\n\nThe Board believes that the above approach of disclosing information about balloon payments three places in the \ntable as part of the early HELOC disclosures would help consumer better understand that a balloon payment may \nbe owed by the consumer at the end of HELOC plan if the consumer only makes minimum required payments, and \nreinforces for the consumer which payments plans carry the possibility of a balloon payment.\n\nReverse mortgages. Current comment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-4 provides guidance on disclosing terms of reverse mortgages, \nalso known as reverse annuity or home-equity conversion mortgages, as part of the application disclosures. The \nBoard proposes to move current comment 5b(d)(5)(iii)-4 to proposed comment 5b(d)(9)(ii)-6, and to make technical \nrevisions to conform this guidance to proposed revisions in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c). The Board requests comment on \nwhether additional guidance is needed by creditors offering reverse mortgages on how to meet the disclosure \nrequirements in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c).\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(9)(iv)\n\nPursuant to its authority under TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures with respect to HELOC \nplans, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iv) to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures a statement that the consumer can borrow money during the draw period. 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(a)(14). In addition, if a repayment period is provided, the creditor would also be required to disclose in the \ntable a statement that the consumer cannot borrow money during the repayment period. Although creditors are not \nspecifically required to include the above information as part of the application disclosures, creditors typically \ninclude this information in the application disclosures. The Board believes that consumers should be informed about \nwhen during the HELOC plan they can make withdrawals and when they are no longer able to borrow money under \nthe plan.\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(9)(v)\n\nAs discussed above, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application \ndisclosures an explanation of how the minimum periodic payments will be determined and the timing of the \npayments (such as whether the payments will be due monthly, quarterly or on some other periodic basis). As \ndiscussed above, the Board proposes to move current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and make \nrevisions. Nonetheless, consistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii), the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) to \nrequire that a creditor disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the timing of the payments (such \nas whether the payments will be due monthly, quarterly or on some other periodic basis.) In addition, the Board \nproposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(v) to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures a statement indicating whether minimum payments are due in the draw period and any repayment \nperiod. In consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested application \ndisclosures in a narrative form, designed to simulate those currently in use. When reviewing these application \ndisclosures, many participants had difficulty understanding how the draw period differs from the repayment period, \nand what impact these distinctions have on required monthly payments. The Board believes that requiring a creditor \nto state explicitly whether minimum payments are due in the draw period and any repayment period will help \nconsumers better understand when minimum payments will be due under the HELOC. 5b(c)(10) Annual \nPercentage Rate\n\nTILA Section 127A(a)(1) provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures each APR \nimposed in connection with the HELOC plan. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(1). Regulation Z currently interprets TILA Section \n127A(a)(1) to mean that for fixed-rate payment plans, a creditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures \na recent APR imposed under the plan. See current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(6). Current footnote 10c provides that a recent APR \nfor fixed-rate plans is a rate that has been in effect under the plan within the 12 months preceding the date that \ndisclosures are provided to the consumer. For variable rate plans, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12), which implements TILA \nSection 127A(a)(2), requires a creditor to disclose the index that will be used to determine the variable rate. 15 \nU.S.C. 1637a(a)(2). In addition, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12) sets forth a number of other disclosures about variable \nrates that must be included as part of the application disclosures, such as a statement that the consumer should \n\n\n\nask about the current index value, margin, discount or premium, and APR. A creditor is not required to disclose in \nthe application disclosures the current APRs that are offered to the consumer on the HELOC plan.\n\nThe Board proposes to require that a creditor disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the \ncurrent APRs that are offered to the consumer on the payment plans described in the early HELOC disclosures \ntable. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) requires that a creditor must disclose in the table each APR applicable \nto any payment plan disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures. The proposal to require a creditor to disclose in the \ntable the APRs applicable to the payment plans disclosed in the table is consistent with TILA Section 127A(a)(1), \nwhich provides that a creditor must disclose \"each annual percentage rate imposed in connection with extensions of \ncredit under the plan. * * *\" 15 U.S.C. 127A(a)(1). In addition, as discussed in more detail above in the section-by-\nsection analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b), consumer testing on HELOC disclosures shows that the current APRs on \nthe HELOC plan are some of the most important pieces of information that consumers want to know in deciding \nwhether to open a HELOC plan. Participants in the consumer testing overwhelmingly indicated that they would \nprefer to receive transaction-specific disclosures, including the current APRs offered to the consumer on the \nHELOC plan, soon after application even if it meant that they would not receive disclosure of general terms before \nthey applied. The Board proposes to delete as obsolete current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(6) and the contents of footnote 10c, \nwhich require the consumer to disclose for fixed-rate plans a recent rate that has been in effect within the 12 \nmonths preceding the date that disclosures are provided to the consumer. In addition, the Board proposes to move \nthe provisions in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12) relating to variable-rate plans to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) and to make \nrevisions to those provisions.\n\nRates applicable to payment plans disclosed. Proposed comment 5b(c)(10)-3 clarifies that under proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(10), a creditor would only be required to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the \nAPRs applicable to the payment plans that are disclosed in the table under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). As discussed \nin more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c), for HELOC plans that are variable-rate \nplans but also offer fixed-rate and -term payment options during the draw period, a creditor may only disclose in the \ntable information applicable to the variable-rate plan, including the applicable APRs. In this case, a creditor may not \ndisclose in the table the APRs applicable to any fixed-rate and -term payment plans offered during the draw period. \nHowever, if a HELOC plan does not offer a variable-rate feature during the draw period, but only offers fixed-rate \nand -term features during that period, a creditor must disclose in the table information related to the fixed-rate and -\nterm features when making the disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c), including the APRs applicable to \nthese features. The Board believes that requiring disclosure of all the APRs applicable to the HELOC plan in the \ntable, even those APRs that relate to payment plans that are not disclosed in the table, would be confusing to \nconsumers.\n\nNonetheless, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose the APRs applicable to other payment \nplans when disclosing those payment plans to a consumer upon request prior to account opening. In particular, \nproposed comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-5 provides guidance on how a creditor must provide additional information on \npayment plans that are not disclosed in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures (other than fixed-rate and -\nterm payment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period) to a consumer upon \nthe consumer's request. This proposed comment provides that if a creditor offers a payment plan other than the two \npayment plans disclosed in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures (except for fixed-rate and -term \npayment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period), and a consumer requests \nadditional information about the other plan, the creditor must disclose an additional table under \u00a7 226.5b(b) to the \nconsumer with the terms of the other payment plan described in the table. Proposed comment 5b(c)(10)-3 makes \nclear that this additional table must include the APRs applicable to that other payment plan.\n\nIn addition, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(18), proposed \ncomment 5b(c)(18)-2 provides guidance on how a creditor must provide additional information about fixed-rate and \n-term payment plans to a consumer upon the consumer's request prior to account opening. This proposed comment \nprovides that in disclosing additional information about the fixed-rate and -term payment plan upon a consumer's \nrequest, a creditor must disclose in the form of a table (1) the information described by proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c) \napplicable to the fixed-rate and -term payment plan (including the APRs applicable to the fixed-rate and -term \n\n\n\npayment plan) and (2) any fees imposed related to the use of the fixed-rate and -term payment plan, such as fees \nto exercise the fixed-rate and -term payment plan or to convert a balance under a fixed-rate and -term payment \nfeature to a variable-rate feature under the plan.\n\nRates changes set forth in initial agreement. Current comments 5b(d)(6)-1 and 5b(d)(12)(viii)-1 provide that a \ncreditor must disclose in the application disclosures a disclosure of preferred-rate provisions, where the rate will \nincrease upon the occurrence of some event, such as the borrower-employee leaving the creditor's employ or the \nconsumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor. The Board proposes to move these comments to \nproposed comment 5b(c)(10)-2 and revise them. Specifically, proposed comment 5b(c)(10)-2 clarifies that proposed \n\u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) requires disclosure of any rate changes set forth in the initial agreement (as discussed in \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(i)) applicable to the payment plans disclosed in the table pursuant to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). For \nexample, a creditor would be required to disclose under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) preferred-rate provisions, where \nthe rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as the borrower-employee leaving the creditor's \nemploy or the consumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor. The creditor would be required to \ndisclose the preferred rate that applies to the plan, and the rate that would apply if the event is triggered, such as \nthe borrower-employee leaving the creditor's employ or the consumer closing an existing deposit account with the \ncreditor. Under this proposed comment, if the preferred rate and the rate that would apply if the event is triggered \nare variable rates, the creditor would be required to disclose those rates based on the applicable index or formula, \nand disclose other information required by proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i).\n\nPenalty APRs. Although under the proposal creditors generally would be required to disclose in the table as part of \nthe early HELOC disclosures the APRs applicable to the payment plans disclosed in the table, proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(10) provides that a creditor must not disclose in the table any penalty rate set forth in the initial \nagreement that may be imposed in lieu of termination of the plan. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-\nsection analysis to \u00a7 226.5b(f), the Board proposes to restrict creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b from \nimposing a penalty rate or penalty fees (except for a contractual late-payment fee) on the account for a consumer's \nfailure to pay the account when due, unless the consumer is more than 30 days late in paying the account. Based \non Board outreach, the Board understands that HELOC creditors generally do not impose a penalty rate, regardless \nof how late the payment is. For this reason, as well as due to the very limited circumstances in which a penalty rate \nmay be imposed under the proposal, the Board believes that information about the penalty rate would not be useful \nto consumers in deciding whether to open a HELOC plan and that including it in the table may distract consumers \nfrom noticing information that is more likely to impact them in choosing and using a HELOC.\n\nPeriodic rates. Proposed comment 5b(c)(10)-1 would clarify that a creditor would be allowed to disclose only APRs \nin the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures. Periodic rates would not be allowed to be disclosed in the table \nas part of the early HELOC disclosures. For example, assume a monthly periodic rate of 1.5 percent applies to \ntransactions on a HELOC account. The corresponding APR to this periodic rate would be 18 percent. Under the \nproposal, creditors would be required to disclose the 18 percent corresponding APR in the early HELOC \ndisclosures table, but may not disclose the 1.5 percent periodic rate in the table. The Board believes information \nabout periodic rates that apply to the HELOC would not be useful to consumers in deciding whether to open a \nHELOC plan, and including this information in the table may distract consumers from noticing more important \ninformation.\n\n16-point font. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) requires that a creditor must provide the APRs disclosed in the table as \npart of the early HELOC disclosures in at least 16-point type, except for the following: any minimum or maximum \nAPRs that may apply; and any disclosure of rate changes set forth in the initial agreement, except for rates that \nwould apply after the expiration of an introductory rate. As discussed above, in consumer testing conducted by the \nBoard on HELOC disclosures, participants indicated that the APRs offered to the consumer on the HELOC plans \nwere some of the most important pieces of information in deciding whether to open a HELOC plan. Thus, the Board \nproposes generally to highlight the APRs in the table. Given that the Board proposes to require a minimum of 10-\npoint font for the disclosures of other terms in the table, the Board believes that a 16-point font size for the APRs \nwould be effective in highlighting the APRs in the table.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) requires that the current APR that will apply to the account be disclosed in 16-point font. \nIf an introductory rate is offered, a creditor would be required to disclose the introductory rate and the rate that \nwould otherwise apply after the introductory rate expires in 16-point font. Under the proposal, the 16-point font \nrequirement would not apply to any minimum or maximum APRs disclosed in the table. In addition, the 16-point font \nrequirement would not apply to any disclosure of rate changes set forth in the initial agreement except for rates that \nwould apply after the expiration of an introductory rate. For example, the 16-point font requirement would not apply \nto any disclosure of the rate that would apply if any preferred rate is terminated. The Board believes that limiting the \n16-point font requirement generally to the current APRs on the account (or an introductory rate and the rate that \nwould otherwise apply after the introductory rate expires) would highlight for consumers the rates that will be most \nrelevant for them at account opening. The Board believes that requiring all of the APRs disclosed in the table to be \nin 16-point font could create \"information overload\" for consumers.\n\n5b(c)(10)(i) Disclosures for Variable-Rate Plans\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2), provides that if a variable-rate feature is \noffered on a HELOC plan, the creditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures the following information \nabout the variable-rate feature: (1) The fact that the APRs, payment, or other terms may change due to the \nvariable-rate feature; (2) the index used in making rate adjustments and a source of information about the index; (3) \nan explanation of how the APR will be determined, including an explanation of how the index is adjusted, such as \nby the addition of the margin; (4) the frequency of changes in the APR: (5) any rules relating to changes in the index \nvalue and the APR and resulting changes in the payment amount, including, for example, an explanation of \npayment limitations and rate carryover; (6) a statement of any annual or more frequent periodic limitations on \nchanges in the APR (or a statement that no annual limitation exists), as well as a statement of the maximum APR \nthat may be imposed under each payment option; (7) an historical example, based on a $ 10,000 extension of \ncredit, illustrating how APRs and payments would have been affected by index value changes implemented \naccording to the terms of the plan (\"historical example table\"). The historical example table must be based on the \nmost recent 15 years of index values (selected for the same time period each year) and must reflect all significant \nplan terms, such as negative amortization, rate carryover, rate discounts, and rate and payment limitations, that \nwould have been affected by the index movement during the period; (8) the minimum periodic payment required \nwhen the maximum APR for each payment option is in effect for a $ 10,000 outstanding balance, and a statement \nof the earliest date or time the maximum rate may be imposed; (9) a statement that the APR does not include costs \nother than interest; (10) a statement that the consumer should ask about the current index value, margin, discount \nor premium, and APR; (11) a statement that rate information will be provided on or with each periodic statement; \nand (12) as applicable, a statement that the initial APR is not based on the index and margin used to make later \nrate adjustments, and the period of time such initial rate will be in effect. As discussed in more detail below, the \nBoard proposes to move current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) and revise it.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(12)-1 provides that sample forms in current Appendix G--14 provide illustrative guidance on \nthe variable-rate rules. The Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-6 and to make \ntechnical revisions. Current comment 5b-4 provides that if a creditor uses an index to determine the rate that will \napply at the time of conversion to the repayment phase--even if the rate will thereafter be fixed--the creditor must \nprovide the variable-rate information in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12), as applicable. The Board proposes to move this \nprovision in current comment 5b-4 to proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-3 and to make technical revisions.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to add new comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-1, which would clarify that a variable-rate account \nexists when rate changes are part of the plan and are tied to an index or formula. This proposed comment also \nprovides a cross reference to comment 6(a)(4)(ii)-1 for examples of variable-rate plans.\n\nDisclosure that APR may change due to the variable-rate feature. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(i) provides that a creditor \nmust include as part of the application disclosures a statement that the APRs, payment, or other terms may change \ndue to the variable-rate feature. Consistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(i), proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i)(A)(1) \nprovides that a creditor must disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the fact that the APR may \n\n\n\nchange due to the variable-rate feature. The Board believes that it is important to highlight for consumers that the \nAPR is a variable rate. Thus, under the proposal, the Board would require a creditor in disclosing the variable-rate \nAPR to use the term \"variable rate\" in underlined text as shown in any of the applicable tables found in proposed \nSamples G--14(C), G--14(D) and G--14(E) in Appendix G. Unlike current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(i), under the proposal, a \ncreditor would not be required to disclose explicitly the fact that the payment or other terms may change due to the \nvariable-rate feature. The Board believes that the proposed payment examples that would be included in the early \nHELOC disclosures communicate effectively to consumers that the payments would change when the APR \nchanges. In consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, participants were asked whether the \npayments on the HELOC plan could vary. Most participants understood from the payment examples contained in \nthe tested forms that the payments on the HELOC plan would increase if the APR increased.\n\nExplanation of how APR will be determined. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(iii), which implements TILA Section \n127A(a)(2)(B), provides that a creditor must include as part of the application disclosures the index used in making \nrate adjustments to the variable APR and a source of information about the index. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(2)(B). \nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(iv) provides that a creditor also must include as part of the application disclosures an \nexplanation of how the variable APR will be determined, including an explanation of how the index is adjusted, \nsuch as by the addition of a margin. Current comment 5b(d)(12)(iv)-1 provides that if a creditor adjusts its index \nthrough the addition of a margin, the disclosure might read, \"Your annual percentage rate is based on the index \nplus a margin.\" The creditor is not required to disclose a specific value for the margin.\n\nConsistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(iii) and (iv), proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i)(A)(2) requires a creditor to disclose \nin the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures an explanation of how the APR will be determined.\n\nConsistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(iii), under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the table \nthe type of index used in making rate adjustments to the variable APR, such as indicating the current APR is based \non the \"prime rate.\" Unlike current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(iv), under the proposal, a creditor also would be required to \ndisclose in the table the value of the margin. In consumer testing conducted on HELOC disclosures, the Board \ntested some versions of the early HELOC disclosures that did not contain the current value of the margin, but \ninstead included only a statement that the APR \"would vary monthly with the Prime Rate.\" The Board also tested \nother versions of the early HELOC disclosures that included the value of the margin, such as by stating that the \nAPR will be \"a variable rate that will change monthly based on the Prime Rate plus 1.00%.\" Participants in \nconsumer testing consistently indicated that they preferred to be shown the value of the margin, so that they would \nhave detailed information about how their APR would be determined over time. Thus, under proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(10)(i)(A)(2), a creditor would be required to disclose in the table the type of index used in making rate \nadjustments (such as the prime rate) and the value of the margin. Current comment 5b(d)(12)(iv)-1 would be \ndeleted as obsolete. Under the proposal, Samples C-14(C), G-14(D) and G-14(E) would provide guidance to \ncreditors on how to disclose the fact that the applicable rate varies and how it is determined. See proposed \ncomment 5b(c)(10)(i)-2.\n\nUnder the proposal, in providing an explanation of how the APR will be determined, a creditor would not be allowed \nto disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the current value of the index, such that the prime \nrate is currently 4 percent. See proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-2. The Board has concerns that requiring the current \nvalue of the index in the table could create \"information overload\" for consumers and could distract consumers from \nnoticing more important information. As described above, the current APR (i.e., the current value of the index plus \nthe margin) and the value of the margin would be disclosed in the table, so a consumer who is interested in \nknowing the current value of the index could calculate the current value of the index from those figures. At the \ncreditor's option, the creditor would be allowed under the proposal to disclose the current value of the index outside \nthe table. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(v).\n\nUnlike current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(iii), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(B), under the proposal, a creditor \nwould not be allowed to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures a source of information about \nthe index used in the making rate adjustments, such as indicating that the prime rate is published in the Wall Street \nJournal. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(2)(B); see proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-2. The Board proposes no longer to require a \n\n\n\ncreditor to provide the source of information about the index, pursuant to the Board's exception and exemption \nauthorities under TILA Section 105. Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make adjustments and exceptions to \nthe requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to \ncompare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). \nSection 105(f) authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions from coverage under any part of TILA if the \nBoard determines that coverage under that part does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of \nuseful information or protection. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). The Board must make this determination in light of \nspecific factors. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2).\n\nThese factors are (1) the amount of the loan and whether the disclosure provides a benefit to consumers who are \nparties to the transaction involving a loan of such amount; (2) the extent to which the requirement complicates, \nhinders, or makes more expensive the credit process; (3) the status of the borrower, including any related financial \narrangements of the borrower, the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction, and the \nimportance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage under TILA; (4) whether the \nloan is secured by the principal residence of the borrower; and (5) whether the exemption would undermine the goal \nof consumer protection.\n\nThe Board has considered each of these factors carefully, and based on that review, believes that the proposed \nexemption is appropriate. The Board proposes not to require a creditor to include information about the source of \nthe index because of concerns of \"information overload\" to consumers. In consumer testing conducted by the Board \non HELOC disclosures, the Board asked participants whether information about the source of the index was \nimportant information for them to know in deciding whether to open a HELOC plan. Most participants indicated that \nthis information was not useful information and would not affect their decision about whether to open a HELOC \nplan. At a creditor's option, the creditor would be allowed under the proposal to disclose information about the \nsource of the index outside of the table. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(v).\n\nFrequency of changes in the APR. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(vii), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(B), \nrequires a creditor to disclose as part of the application disclosures the frequency of changes in the variable-rate \nAPR, such as disclosing that the variable rate may change on a monthly basis. Consistent with current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(12)(vii), under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(3), a creditor would be required to disclose in the table as \npart of the early HELOC disclosures the frequency of changes in, the variable-rate APR.\n\nRules relating to changes in the index value and the APR and resulting changes in the payment amount. Current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(12)(viii), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(2)(B), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of \nthe application disclosures any rules relating to changes in the index value and the APR and resulting changes in \nthe payment amount, including, for example, an explanation of payment limitations and rate carryover. 15 U.S.C. \n127(a)(2)(B). Current comment 5b(d)(12)(viii)-1 clarifies that current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(viii) requires a creditor to \ndisclose as part of the application disclosures any preferred-rate provisions, where the rate will increase upon the \noccurrence of some event, such as the borrower-employee leaving the creditor's employ or the consumer closing \nan existing deposit account with the creditor. Current comment 5b(d)(12)(viii)-2 provides a cross reference to \ncurrent comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-2, which discusses the disclosure requirement for options permitting the consumer to \nconvert from a variable rate to a fixed rate.\n\nConsistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(viii), proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(4) requires a creditor to disclose in the \ntable as part of the early HELOC disclosures any rules relating to changes in the index value and the APR and \nresulting changes in the payment amount, including, for example, an explanation of payment limitations and rate \ncarryover. As discussed above, current comment 5b(d)(12)(viii)-1 dealing with preferred-rate provisions would be \nmoved to proposed comment 5b(c)(10)-2.\n\nThe Board proposes to delete as obsolete current comment 5b(d)(12)(viii)-2, which deals with disclosure of options \npermitting the consumer to convert from a variable rate to a fixed rate. As discussed in the section-by-section \nanalysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c) and (c)(18), under the proposal, a creditor generally would not be permitted to \n\n\n\ndisclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures information related to fixed-rate and -term payment \nfeatures, including information about how the rates that apply to those features are determined.\n\nLimitations on changes in rates. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(E) and (F), \nprovides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures a statement of any annual or more \nfrequent periodic limitations on changes in the APR (or a statement that no annual limitation exists), as well as a \nstatement of the maximum APR that may be imposed under each payment option. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(2)(E) and \n(F). Under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), a creditor is not required to disclose any periodic limitations on changes in \nthe APR that are longer than a year--such as rate caps that would apply every two years.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(5) requires a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures \na statement of any limitations on changes in the APR, including the minimum and maximum APRs that may be \nimposed under each payment option disclosed in the table. In addition, under the proposal, if no annual or other \nperiodic limitations apply to changes in the APR, a creditor would be required in the table to include a statement \nthat no annual limitation exists. Thus, consistent with current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), under the proposal, a creditor \nwould be required to disclose in the table any annual or more frequent periodic limitations on changes in the APR \nand to disclose the maximum APR that may be imposed under each payment option disclosed in the table.\n\nUnlike current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), however, under the proposal, a creditor must disclose in the table any periodic \nlimitations on changes in the APR that are longer than a year--such as rate caps that would apply every two years. \nIn addition, unlike current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), a creditor also would be required to disclose in the table any minimum \nrate that would apply to the payment plans disclosed in the table, such as a rate floor. The Board proposes to add \nthese disclosures pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures with \nrespect to HELOC plans. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). The Board believes that consumers should be informed of all rate \ncaps, and rate floors, as consumer testing has shown that rate information is among the most important information \nto a consumer in deciding whether to open a HELOC plan.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(12)(ix)-1 clarifies that if a creditor bases its rate limitation on 12 monthly billing cycles, this \nlimitation should be treated as an annual cap. Rate limitations imposed on less than an annual basis must be stated \nin terms of a specific amount of time. For example, if the creditor imposes rate limitations on only a semiannual \nbasis, this must be expressed as a rate limitation for a six-month time period. If the creditor does not impose \nperiodic limitations (annual or shorter) on rate increases, the fact that there are no annual rate limitations must be \nstated.\n\nThe Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-4 and to revise it. Specifically, \nproposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-4 clarifies that under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(5), a creditor would be required \nto disclose any rate limitations that occur, including rate limitations that occur in a time period of more than one \nyear, annually or less than annually If the creditor bases its rate limitation on 12 monthly billing cycles, this limitation \nwould be treated as an annual cap. A creditor would be required to state rate limitations imposed on more or less \nthan an annual basis in terms of a specific amount of time. For example, if the creditor imposes rate limitations on \nonly a semiannual basis, a creditor would be required to express this limitation as a rate limitation for a six-month \ntime period. If a creditor does not impose annual or other periodic limitations on rate increases, the creditor would \nbe required to state this fact in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures.\n\nRegarding disclosure of the maximum APR that may be imposed over the term of the plan, current comment \n5b(d)(12)(ix)-2 provides that a creditor may disclose this rate as a specific number (for example, 18 percent) or as a \nspecific amount above the initial rate. If the creditor states the maximum rate as a specific amount above the initial \nrate, the creditor must include a statement that the consumer should inquire about the rate limitations that are \ncurrently available. If an initial discount is not taken into account in applying maximum rate limitations, that fact must \nbe disclosed. If separate overall limitations apply to rate increases resulting from events such as the exercise of a \nfixed-rate conversion option or leaving the creditor's employ, those limitations also must be stated. The current \ncomment provides that a creditor is not required to disclose in the application disclosures any legal limits in the \nnature of usury or rate ceilings under state or federal statutes or regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Board proposes to move current comment 5b(d)(12)(ix)-2 to proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-5 and revise it. \nSpecifically, proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(i)-5 provides that the maximum APR that may be imposed under each \npayment option disclosed in the table over the term of the plan (including the draw period and any repayment period \nprovided for in the initial agreement) must be provided. If separate overall limitations apply to rate increases \nresulting from events such as leaving the creditor's employ, those limitations also must be stated. Limitations would \nnot include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or federal statutes or regulations.\n\nThe Board would delete as obsolete the guidance in current 5b(d)(12)(ix)-2 related to disclosing the maximum APR \nas a specific amount above the initial rate. Under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10), a creditor must disclose the maximum \nAPR as a specific number.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(12)(ix)-3 provides that a creditor need not disclose each periodic or maximum rate limitation \nthat is currently available. Instead, the creditor may disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodic and \nmaximum rate limitations that may apply to the creditor's HELOC plans. Creditors using this alternative must \ninclude a statement that the consumer should inquire about the rate limitations that are currently available. The \nBoard proposes to delete this comment as obsolete. Under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10), a creditor would be required \nto disclose the periodic limitations and maximum APRs that may be imposed under each payment option disclosed \nin the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures.\n\nDisclosure of the lowest and highest value of the index in the past 15 years. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xi), which \nimplements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(G), requires a creditor to provide as part of the application disclosures a \nhistorical example, based on a $ 10,000 extension of credit, illustrating how APRs and payments would have been \naffected by index value changes implemented according to the terms of the plan. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(2)(G). The \nhistorical example must be based on the most recent 15 years of index values (selected for the same time period \neach year) and must reflect all significant plan terms, such as negative amortization, rate carryover, rate discounts, \nand rate and payment limitations that would have been affected by the index movement during the period. For ease \nof reference, this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION will refer to this disclosure as the \"historical example table.\" \nCurrent comments 5b(d)(12)(xi)-1 through -10 provide guidance to creditors on how to provide the historical \nexample table.\n\nFor the reasons discussed below, the Board proposes not to require that a creditor disclose as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures the historical example table. Thus, the Board proposes to delete current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xi) and \ncurrent comments 5b(d)(12)(xi)-1 through -10. Instead of requiring a creditor to disclose the historical example \ntable, the Board proposes to require that a creditor disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the \nlowest and highest values of the index used to determine the variable rate on the HELOC plan in the past 15 years.\n\nThe Board proposes no longer to require a creditor to provide the historical example table, pursuant to the Board's \nexception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105(a) and 105(f), as discussed above. The Board's \nconsumer testing of HELOC disclosures shows that this disclosure may be confusing to consumers, and may not \nprovide meaningful information to consumers. In consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, \nthe Board tested versions of the application disclosures and the early HELOC disclosures that contained a historical \nexample table. Many participants misunderstood the information provided in the historical example table. A large \ngroup of participants did not understand that the information in this table was based on the actual historical behavior \nof interest rates; they instead assumed that the data shown was a hypothetical example of how interest rates and \npayments might fluctuate in the future. More significantly, an even larger group of participants mistakenly thought \nthat the rate and payment information shown in the historical example table would apply to the HELOC plan going \nforward, and that the table contained information on the exact monthly payments that the participant would be \nrequired to make in the future under the HELOC plan.\n\nEven after the meaning of the table was explained to participants, many participants indicated that, because the \nrates and payment information in the table were based on what had happened to the interest rate in the past 15 \nyears, the table did not contain valuable information that would inform their decision about the HELOC for which \nthey were applying. These participants did not believe that knowing how the index had behaved in the past would \n\n\n\nprovide them useful information to predict how the index might behave in the future. A few participants indicated \nthat the table did not offer any new information that was not already communicated in the disclosure, namely that \nthe APR and payments may vary.\n\nBased on this consumer testing, the Board proposes not to require that creditors provide the historical example \ntable as part of the early HELOC disclosures. However, pursuant to the Board's authority under TILA Section \n127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, the Board proposes to require a creditor to provide \nin the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the range of the value of the index over a 15-year historical \nperiod. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). Although many participants in the consumer testing indicated that the historical \nexample table did not provide useful information about how interest rates and payment may change in the future, \nsome participants did indicate that they found it helpful to know how the index had behaved in the past, so that they \nwould have some sense about how it might change in the future. In addition, some participants found the range of \nthe index useful in determining the likelihood of the APR reaching the maximum APR allowed under the plan. The \nBoard believes that the proposed disclosure providing the range of the value of the index over a 15-year historical \nperiod will provide the most important information from the historical example table in a simple and efficient way.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on the appropriateness of this proposal. The Board also solicits comment on whether \nthe new proposed disclosure should show the range of the APR that would have applied to the HELOC plan over \nthe past 15 years, calculated based on the range of the index value plus the margin that is currently offered to the \nconsumer, or as proposed, simply show the index range. For example, assume the index on the HELOC account is \nthe prime rate and the prime rate varied between 4.25 percent and 10 percent over the last 15 years. In addition, \nassume the APR offered to the consumer is calculated as the prime rate plus 1.00 percent. Under the new \nproposed disclosure in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(6), a creditor would be required to disclose that over the past \n15 years, the prime rate had varied between 4.25 percent and 10 percent. The Board solicits comment on whether \nthe Board should instead require that a creditor disclose, based on the example above, that over the past 15 years, \nthe APR on the HELOC plan offered to the consumer would have varied between 5.25 percent and 11 percent.\n\nMaximum rate payment example. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(H), \nprovides that a creditor must provide as part of the application disclosures the minimum periodic payment required \nwhen the maximum APR for each payment option is in effect for a $ 10,000 outstanding balance, and a statement \nof the earliest date or time the maximum rate may be imposed. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(2)(H). Current comment \n5b(d)(12)(x)-1 provides guidance for creditors on how to provide the maximum rate payment example. Current \ncomment 5b(d)(12)(x)-2 provides guidance on how a creditor should calculate the earliest date or time the \nmaximum rate may be imposed. As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9), \nthe Board proposes to move current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii), and to delete comment \n5b(d)(12)(x)-1 as obsolete.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes not to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures a statement of the earliest date or time the maximum rate may be imposed, pursuant to the Board's \nexception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105(a) and 105(f), as discussed above. Based on \nconsumer testing, the Board believes that this disclosure may not provide meaningful information to consumers, \nand that including it in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures may distract consumers from more \nimportant information. The Board tested versions of the early HELOC disclosures which indicated that the maximum \nrate could be reached as early as the first month, based on the Board's understanding that this statement reflects \nthe terms of most HELOC accounts regarding when the maximum rate could be reached. Participants were asked \nwhether they found this information useful in deciding whether to open the HELOC plan being offered. Many \nparticipants did not find this statement useful because they believed it was extremely unlikely that the rate would \nactually increase that quickly. The Board also understands that while theoretically the maximum rate may be \nimposed during the first month of the HELOC plan, in practice this has rarely if ever occurred.\n\nStatement that the APR does not include costs other than interest. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ii), which implements \nTILA Section 127A(a)(2)(A) and (C), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures that \nthe variable APR does not include costs other than interest. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(2)(A) and (C). (A creditor also must \n\n\n\nmake this disclosure with respect to disclosure of any fixed-rate APR in the application disclosures. See current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(6).)\n\nThe Board proposes not to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures a \nstatement that the APRs applicable to the HELOC plan do not include costs other than interest, pursuant to the \nBoard's exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105(a) and 105(f), as discussed above. Based on \nconsumer testing, the Board believes that this disclosure may not provide meaningful information to consumers, \nand that including it in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures may distract consumers from more \nimportant information. The Board tested versions of the early HELOC disclosures indicating that the APRs included \nin the table do not include costs other than interest. The purpose of this requirement is to make clear to consumers \nthat an APR on a HELOC cannot be directly compared to an APR on a closed-end loan, which includes most fees. \nHowever, several participants misunderstood this sentence; for example, some incorrectly thought that they would \nnot be charged any fees. Just as important, no participants understood the purpose of this statement, or how they \ncould use the information when applying for a home-equity product. Different versions of this statement were tested \nin several rounds to give it proper context for maximum comprehension, but all attempts were unsuccessful in \ncommunicating to consumer the statement's intended purpose.\n\nStatement that the consumer should ask about the current index value, margin, discount or premium, and APR. \nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(v), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(D), provides that a creditor must disclose as \npart of the application disclosures a statement that the consumer should ask about the current index value, margin, \ndiscount or premium, and APR. 15 U.S.C. 127A(a)(2)(D). The Board proposes not to require a creditor to include \nthis statement in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures, pursuant to the Board's exception and \nexemption authorities under TILA Section 105(a) and 105(f), as discussed above. This statement is obsolete for the \nearly HELOC disclosures. As discussed above, a creditor would be required to disclose in the table as part of the \nearly HELOC disclosures the current APRs offered to the consumer (i.e., the current value of the index plus the \nmargin) as well as the margin, including any introductory APR (as discussed below). A creditor would not be \nallowed to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the current value of the index, such that the \nprime rate is currently 4 percent.\n\nStatement that rate information will be provided on or with each periodic statement. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xii), \nwhich implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(I), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application \ndisclosures a statement that rate information will be provided on or with each periodic statement. 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(a)(2)(I). The Board proposes not to require a creditor to include this statement in the table as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures, pursuant to the Board's exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105(a) and \n105(f), as discussed above. Based on consumer testing, the Board believes that this disclosure may not provide \nmeaningful information to consumers, and that including it in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures may \ndistract consumers from more important information. The Board tested versions of the early HELOC disclosures \nindicating that monthly statements for the HELOC plan would tell the consumer each time the rate changes on the \nplan. Participants were asked whether they found this information useful in deciding whether to open the HELOC \nplan offered. Many participants did not find this information useful because even in the absence of this statement \nthey would assume that they would be notified of rate changes on their monthly statements.\n\nAccuracy of variable rates. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(B) provides that a variable rate disclosed in the table as \npart of the early HELOC disclosures would be considered accurate if it is a rate as of a specified date and this rate \nwas in effect within the last 30 days before the disclosures are provided. The Board believes 30 days would provide \nsufficient flexibility to creditors and reasonably current information to consumers.\n\n5b(c)(10)(ii) Introductory Initial Rate\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(vi), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(2)(C), provides that if a creditor offers a \nvariable rate on a HELOC account, a creditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures, as applicable, a \nstatement that the initial APR is not based on the index and margin used to make later rate adjustments, and the \n\n\n\nperiod of time the initial rate will be in effect. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(2)(C). The Board proposes to move \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(12)(vi) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(ii) and revise it.\n\nSpecifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(ii) provides that if the initial rate is an introductory rate, a creditor would be \nrequired to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the introductory rate, and would be required \nto use the term \"introductory\" or \"intro\" in immediate proximity to the introductory rate. The creditor also would be \nrequired to disclose in the table the time period during which the introductory rate will remain in effect. In addition, a \ncreditor would be required to disclose in the table the rate that would otherwise apply to the plan. Where the rate \nthat would otherwise apply is variable, the creditor would be required to disclose the rate based on the applicable \nindex or formula, and disclose the other variable-rate disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i). See \nalso proposed comment 5b(c)(10)(ii)-3. The Board believes that clearly labeling the introductory rate as such and \ndisclosing when the introductory rate will expire will benefit consumers by helping them understand the temporary \nnature of this rate.\n\nProposed comment 5b(c)(10)(ii)-1 clarifies that if a creditor offers a preferred rate that will increase a specified \namount upon the occurrence of a specified event other than the expiration of a specific time period, such as the \nborrower-employee leaving the creditor's employ, the preferred rate would not be an introductory rate under \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(ii), but must be disclosed in accordance with proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10).\n\nProposed comment 5b(c)(10)(ii)-2 provides guidance on providing the term \"introductory\" or \"into\" in immediate \nproximity to the introductory rate. Specifically, this proposed comment provides that if the term \"introductory\" is in \nthe same phrase as the introductory rate, it will be deemed to be in immediate proximity of the listing. For example, \na creditor that uses the phrase \"introductory APR X percent\" would be deemed to have used the word \"introductory\" \nwithin the same phrase as the rate. In addition, this proposed comment also provides that if more than one \nintroductory rate may apply to a particular balance in succeeding periods, the term \"introductory\" need only be used \nto describe the first introductory rate. For example, if a creditor offers an introductory rate of 8.99 percent on the \nplan for six months, and an introductory rate of 10.99 percent for the following six months, the term \"introductory\" \nneed only be used to describe the 8.99 percent rate. This proposed comment also provides a cross reference to \nproposed Samples G-14(C) and G-14(E) in Appendix G, which provides guidance on how to disclose clearly and \nconspicuously the expiration date of the introductory rate and the rate that will apply after the introductory rate \nexpires, if an introductory rate is disclosed in the table.\n\n5b(c)(11) Fees Imposed by the Creditor and Third Parties To Open the Plan\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(3), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of \nthe application disclosures an itemization of any fees imposed by the creditor to open, use, or maintain the plan, \nstated as a dollar amount or percentage, and when such fees are payable. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(3). Current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(8), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(4), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the \napplication disclosures a good faith estimate, stated as a single dollar amount or range, of any fees that may be \nimposed by persons other than the creditor to open the plan, as well as a statement that the consumer may receive, \nupon request, a good faith itemization of such fees. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(4). In lieu of the statement, the itemization \nof such fees may be provided.\n\nFees imposed by a creditor to maintain and use the plan. As described above, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) requires a \ncreditor to disclose as part of the application disclosures any fees imposed by the creditor to maintain and use the \nHELOC plan. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(13), the Board \nproposes to move this part of current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(13) and to revise it.\n\nOne-time account-opening fees. As discussed above, with respect to account-opening fees, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) \nrequires a creditor to disclose in the application disclosures an itemization of any fees imposed by the creditor to \nopen the HELOC plan, stated as a dollar amount or percentage. Current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) does not require a creditor \nto disclose the total of one-time fees imposed by the creditor to open the HELOC plan. Under current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(8), however, a creditor must disclose in the application disclosures a good faith estimate of the total of \n\n\n\nfees imposed by third parties to open the HELOC plan. Under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(8), at a creditor's option, the \ncreditor may disclose an itemization of third party fees to open a HELOC plan. Current comment 5b(d)(8)-2 \nprovides guidance to creditors on how to disclose the total of third party fees and an itemization of those fees. As \ndiscussed in more detail below, the Board proposes to move these provisions in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) and (d)(8) to \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) and revise them. Current comment 5b(d)(8)-2 would be deleted as obsolete.\n\nThe Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures the total of all one-time fees imposed by the creditor and any third parties to open the plan, stated as a \ndollar amount. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). In addition, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), a creditor would be required to \nitemize in the table all one-time fees imposed by the creditor and any third parties to open the plan, stated as a \ndollar amount, and when these fees are payable. Proposed comment 5b(c)(11)-5 provides that a creditor would be \ndeemed to have itemized the account-opening fees clearly and conspicuously if the creditor provides this \ninformation in a bullet format as shown in proposed Samples G-14(C), G-14(D), and G-14(E) in Appendix G. The \nBoard proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the \nrequirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare \ncredit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit, and pursuant to its authority in TILA Section \n127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a), and 1637a(a)(14).\n\nThe Board believes that requiring a creditor to disclose in the table the total dollar amount for all one-time fees \nimposed to open the HELOC plan and an itemization of those costs, regardless of whether those fees are charged \nby the creditor or a third party, will help consumers better understand the costs of opening a HELOC plan. In the \nconsumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, all of the application and early HELOC disclosure \nforms that participants were shown included a range of the total of one-time fees that the borrower would be \ncharged for opening the account. Some forms also provided an itemization of the one-time fees that would be \ncharged for opening the account. (The one-time fees shown on the disclosure forms were a loan origination fee, a \nloan discount fee, an underwriting fee, and an appraisal fee). In this consumer testing, participants consistently said \nthat they preferred to see both the total of one-time account-opening fees and the itemization of these fees to help \nthem understand what fees they would be paying to open the HELOC plan.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(7)-2 provides that charges imposed by the creditor to open a HELOC plan may be stated as \nan estimated dollar amount for each fee, or as a percentage of a typical or representative amount of credit. Current \n5b(d)(8)-3 provides that a creditor in disclosing the total of account-opening fees imposed by third parties may \nprovide, based on a typical or representative amount of credit, a range for such fees or state the dollar amount of \nsuch fees. Fees may be expressed on a unit cost basis, for example, $ 5 per $ 1,000 of credit. The Board proposes \nto move these comments to \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) and revise them.\n\nSpecifically, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), a creditor would be required to disclose the dollar amount of fees that \nwill be imposed by the creditor or by third parties to open the plan. Concerning the requirement to itemize the one-\ntime account-opening fees, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) allows a creditor to provide a range of these fees, if the dollar \namount of a fee is not known at the time the early HELOC disclosures are delivered or mailed. Proposed comment \n5b(c)(11)-2 provides that if a range is shown, a creditor would be required to assume, in calculating the highest \namount of the fee that the consumer will borrow the full credit line at account opening. In disclosing the lowest \namount of the fee in the range, a creditor would be required to disclose the lowest amount of the fee that may be \nimposed. Regarding disclosure of the total of one-time account-opening fees, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) provides \nthat if the exact total of one-time fees for account opening is not known at the time the early HELOC disclosures are \ndelivered or mailed, a creditor must disclose in the table the highest total of one-time account opening fees possible \nfor the plan terms with an indication that the one-time account opening costs may be \"up to\" that amount.\n\nThe Board believes that requiring the one-time fees that are imposed to open the account to be disclosed as a \ndollar amount, instead of a percentage of another amount, would aid consumers' understanding of the account-\nopening fees and may aid consumers in comparison shopping for HELOC plans. In consumer testing conducted on \ncredit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board found that consumers generally \nunderstand dollar amounts better than percentages. As a result, the Board believes that requiring account opening \n\n\n\nfees to be disclosed as dollar amounts instead of percentages of another amount would better enable consumers to \nunderstand the start up-costs of opening a HELOC plan. In addition, consumers could more easily compare the \ndollar amount of one-time account-opening fees on different HELOC plans if all HELOC plans are required to \ndisclose the dollar amount. If the account-opening fees were presented as a percentage of another amount, \nconsumers would need to calculate the dollar amount themselves.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(7)-1 provides guidance on what types of fees would be considered fees imposed by the \ncreditor to open the plan required to be disclosed under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7). Current comment 5b(d)(8)-1 \nprovides guidance on what types of fees would be considered account-opening fees imposed by third parties \nrequired to be disclosed under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(8). The Board proposes to move these provisions in current \ncomments 5b(d)(7)-1 and 5b(d)(8)-1 to proposed comment 5b(c)(11)-1 and revise them. Specifically, proposed \ncomment 5b(c)(11)-1 clarifies that proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) only applies to one-time fees imposed by the creditor \nor third parties to open the plan. The fees referred to in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) would include items such as \napplication fees, points, appraisal or other property valuation fees, credit report fees, government agency fees, and \nattorneys' fees. This proposed comment makes clear that annual fees or other periodic fees that may be imposed \nfor the availability of the plan would not be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), but would be disclosed under \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12).\n\nCurrent comments 5b(d)(7)-4 and 5b(d)(8)-4 provide that if closing costs are imposed by the creditor and third \nparties they must be disclosed, regardless of whether such costs may be rebated later (for example, rebated to the \nextent of any interest paid during the first year of the plan). The Board proposes to move these comments to \nproposed comment 5b(c)(11)-4 and to make technical revisions.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(8)-1 provides that in cases where property insurance is required by the creditor, the creditor \nmay disclose as part of the application disclosures either the amount of the premium or a statement that property \ninsurance is required. The Board proposes to delete this comment as obsolete. Under the proposal, proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(11) provides that a creditor must not disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC the amount of any \nproperty insurance premiums, even if the creditor requires property insurance. The Board believes that disclosure of \nthe amount of any required property insurance premiums is not needed in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures. Consumers are likely to have property insurance on the home prior to obtaining a HELOC account. For \nexample, most consumers obtaining a HELOC will already have a first mortgage on their home and will be carrying \nproperty insurance on the home as required by the first mortgage. The Board solicits comment on this aspect of the \nproposal.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(7)-5 provides that a creditor need not use the terms \"finance charge\" or \"other charge\" in \ndescribing the fees imposed by the creditor under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) or those imposed by third parties under \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(8). Under current \u00a7 226.7, a creditor is required to distinguish costs that are finance charges \nfrom other charges on the periodic statement by requiring finance charges to be labeled as such. Current comment \n5b(d)(7)-5 makes clear that a creditor is not required to use these labels in describing fees disclosed under current \n\u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) and (d)(8). The Board proposes to delete this comment as obsolete, because under the proposal, a \ncreditor would no longer be required to distinguish finance charges from other charges in disclosing costs on the \nperiodic statement. See the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.7.\n\n5b(c)(12) Fees Imposed by the Creditor for Availability of the Plan\n\nAs discussed above, current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application \ndisclosures any fees imposed by the creditor to maintain or use the HELOC plans. Current comment 5b(d)(7)-1 \nprovides that fees imposed by the creditor to maintain or use the HELOC plan include annual fees, transaction fees, \nfees to obtain checks to access the plan, and fees imposed for converting to a repayment phase that is provided for \nin the original agreement. Current comment 5b(d)(7)-3 provides that fees not imposed to use or maintain a plan, \nsuch as fees for researching an account, photocopying, paying late, stopping payment, having a check returned, \nexceeding the credit limit, or closing out an account, do not have to be disclosed under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7). In \naddition, credit report and appraisal fees imposed to investigate whether a condition permitting a freeze continues \n\n\n\nto exist--as discussed in the commentary to current \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)--are not required to be disclosed under \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7). The Board proposes to move the provisions in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7) relating to disclosing \nfees imposed by the creditor to maintain and use the HELOC plan to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) and to revise them. \nSpecifically, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) requires a creditor to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures table any \nannual or other periodic fees that may be imposed by the creditor for the availability of the plan, including any fee \nbased on account activity or inactivity; how frequently the fee will be imposed; and the annualized amount of the \nfee.\n\nThe Board proposes not to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures fees \nimposed by the creditor to maintain and use the HELOC plan, except for fees for the availability of the plan. The \nBoard proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the \nrequirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare \ncredit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The Board \nbelieves that requiring a creditor to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures all fees imposed by the creditor to \nmaintain and use the HELOC plan, such as transaction fees, could contribute to \"information overload\" for \nconsumers. In the consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, participants were shown \nversions of a disclosure table that itemized account-opening fees, penalty fees and transaction fees. Participants \nwere asked which of these fees was most important for them to know when deciding whether to open a HELOC \nplan. Most participants indicated that it was most important for them to be provided an itemization of the account-\nopening fees in the early HELOC disclosures, so that they could better understand the costs of opening the HELOC \nplan.\n\nAs noted, the Board also proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the \nearly HELOC disclosures any fees for the availability of the plan. The Board believes that it is important for \nconsumers to be informed in the early HELOC disclosures of fees for the availability of the plan, so that consumers \nwill be aware of these fees as they decide whether to open a HELOC plan. As discussed in the Background section \nto this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, board research indicates that many HELOC consumers do not plan to \ntake advances at account opening, but instead plan to use that HELOC account in emergency cases. The on-going \ncosts of maintaining the HELOC plan may be of particular importance to these consumers in deciding whether to \nopen a HELOC plan for these purposes.\n\nOther fees to maintain or use the plan that would currently be disclosed in the application disclosures under current \n\u00a7 226.5b(d)(7), such as transactions fees, would not be required to be disclosed in the table as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures under the proposal. Nonetheless, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis \nto proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(14), a creditor would be required to disclose in the table a statement that that other fees \nwill apply and a reference to penalty fees and transaction fees as examples of those fees, as applicable. In addition, \na creditor would be required to disclose in the table either (1) a statement that the consumer may receive, upon \nrequest, additional information about fees applicable to the plan, or (2) if the additional information about fees is \nprovided with the table, a reference where that information is located outside the table. The Board believes that this \napproach of highlighting in the table the fees on the HELOC plan that would be most important to consumers in \ndeciding whether to open a HELOC plan and allowing consumers to receive information about additional fees upon \nrequest appropriately informs consumers about important fees applicable to the HELOC plan in the early HELOC \ndisclosures, without creating \"information overload\" that discourages consumers from reading disclosures at all, \ndistract them from key information, or prevent retention and understanding of information.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(7)-1 provides that a creditor would be required to disclose in the application disclosures any \nfees imposed by the creditor to use or maintain the plan, whether the fees are kept by the creditor or a third party. \nFor example, if a creditor requires an annual credit report on the consumer and requires the consumer to pay this \nfee to the creditor or directly to the third party, the fee must be specifically stated in the application disclosures. The \nBoard proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(c)(12)-2 and revise it. Specifically, proposed \ncomment 5b(c)(12)-2 clarifies that a creditor would be required to disclose all fees imposed by the creditor for the \navailability of the plan in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures, regardless of whether those fees are \nkept by the creditor or a third party. For example, if a creditor requires an annual credit report on the consumer and \n\n\n\nrequires the consumer to pay this fee to the creditor or directly to the third party, the fee must be disclosed in the \ntable under.\n\nThe Board also proposes to add new comment 5b(c)(12)-1, which would clarify that fees for the availability of credit \nrequired to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) would include any fees to obtain access devices, such as \nfees to obtain checks or credit cards to access the plan. For example, a fee to obtain checks or a credit card on the \naccount would be required to be disclosed in the table as a fee for issuance or availability under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12). \nThis fee would be required to be disclosed even if the fee is optional; that is, if the fee is charged only if the \nconsumer requests checks or a credit card.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to add new comment 5b(c)(12)-3 to clarify that if fees required to be disclosed \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) are waived or reduced for a limited time, a creditor would be allowed to disclose, in \naddition to the required fees, the introductory fees or the fact of fee waivers in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures if the creditor also discloses how long the reduced fees or waivers will remain in effect.\n\n5b(c)(13) Fees Imposed by the Creditor for Early Termination of the Plan by the Consumer\n\nCurrently, a creditor is not required to disclose in the application disclosures any fee imposed by the creditor for \nearly termination of the plan by the consumer. See current comment 5b(d)(7)-3. Pursuant to the Board's authority in \nTILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, the Board proposes to add new \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(13) to required a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures any fee that may \nbe imposed by the creditor if a consumer terminates the plan prior to its scheduled maturity. 15 U.S.C. 127a(a)(14). \nThe Board believes that it is important for consumers to be informed as they decide whether to open a HELOC plan \nof early termination fees. This information may be especially important for consumers who may want to have the \noption of refinancing or cancelling the plan at any time. HELOC consumers may particularly value these options, as \nmost HELOCs are subject to a variable interest rate.\n\nThe Board proposes to add new comment 5b(c)(13)-1 to clarify the types of fees that would be required to be \ndisclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(13). This proposed comment clarifies that fees such as penalty or \nprepayment fees that the creditor imposes if the consumer terminates the plan prior to its scheduled maturity would \nbe required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(13). These fees also would include waived account-opening fees for \nthe plan, if the creditor will impose those costs on the consumer if the consumer terminates the plan within a certain \namount of time after account opening. In addition, the proposed comment clarifies that fees that the creditor may \nimpose in lieu of termination under comment 5b(f)(2)-2 would not be required to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(13). However, fees that are imposed when the plan expires in accordance with the agreement or that are \nassociated with collection of the debt if the creditor terminates the plan, such as attorneys' fees and court costs, \nwould not be required to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(13).\n\n5b(c)(14) Statement About Other Fees\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), and (c)(12), the Board \nproposes not to require a creditor to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures table all of the fees that may be \nimposed on the HELOC plan. Instead, a creditor would be required to disclose in the table only the following fees: \n(1) Fees imposed by the creditor and third parties to open the HELOC plan; (2) fees imposed by the creditor for \navailability of the plan; (3) fees imposed by the creditor if a consumer terminates the plan prior to its scheduled \nmaturity; and (4) fees imposed by the creditor for required insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension \ncoverage. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), (c)(12), (c)(13) and (c)(19). Nonetheless, pursuant to the Board's \nauthority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, the Board proposes to \nrequire a creditor to disclose in the table a statement that other fees will apply and a reference to penalty fees and \ntransaction fees as examples of those fees, as applicable. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). In addition, a creditor would be \nrequired to disclose in the table either (1) a statement that the consumer may receive, upon request, additional \n\n\n\ninformation about fees applicable to the plan, or (ii) if the additional information about fees is provided with the table, \na reference to where that information is located outside the table.\n\nNot all fees applicable to a HELOC plan will be disclosed in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures. Thus, \nto ensure consumer understanding of fees the Board believes that it is important to notify consumers that additional \nfees will apply to the plan, and that consumers may receive information about certain additional fees upon request \nprior to account opening. In consumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested \nversions of the early HELOC disclosures that contained a statement notifying consumers of additional fees and \nversions of the disclosures forms that did not contain this statement. Many participants that saw the disclosure \nforms that did not contain the statement that other fees may apply incorrectly assumed that no other fees would be \ncharged.\n\nThe Board proposes to add new comment 5b(c)(14)-1 to require a creditor in providing additional information about \nfees to a consumer upon the consumer's request prior to account opening (or along with the early HELOC \ndisclosures) to disclose the penalty fees and transaction fees that are required to be disclosed in the account-\nopening summary table under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(x) through (a)(2)(xiv) and a statement that other fees may \napply. A creditor must use a tabular format to disclose the additional information about fees that is provided upon \nrequest or provided outside the early HELOC disclosures table. Under proposed comment 5b(c)-2, a creditor would \nbe required to provide this additional information about fees as soon as reasonably possible after the request.\n\nThe Board believes that fees applicable to the HELOC plan that would be most important to consumers in deciding \nwhether to open a HELOC plan should be emphasized by being placed in the table. In addition, under the proposal, \nconsumers would be able to obtain quickly and easily additional information about other fees upon request. The \nBoard believes that this proposed approach appropriately informs consumers about important fees applicable to the \nHELOC plan in the early HELOC disclosures, without creating \"information overload\" that can discourage \nconsumers from reading disclosures at all, distract them from key information, or prevent retention and \nunderstanding of information.\n\n5b(c)(15) Negative Amortization\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(9), which implements TILA Section 127A(a)(11), provides that if applicable, a creditor must \nprovide as part of the application disclosures a statement that negative amortization may occur and that negative \namortization increases the principal balance and reduces the consumer's equity in the dwelling. 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(a)(11). The Board proposes to move current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(9) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(15) and to make \ntechnical revisions.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(9)-1 provides that in transactions where the minimum payment will not or may not be \nsufficient to cover the interest that accrues on the outstanding balance, the creditor must disclose that negative \namortization will or may occur. This disclosure is required whether or not the unpaid interest is added to the \noutstanding balance upon which interest is computed. A disclosure is not required merely because a loan calls for \nnon-amortizing or partially amortizing payments. The Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment \n5b(c)(15)-1 and revise it. Specifically, proposed comment 5b(c)(15)-1 contains the guidance discussed above. In \naddition, proposed comment 5b(c)(15)-1 provides that a creditor would be deemed to meet the requirements of \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(15) if the creditor provides the following disclosure, as applicable: \"Your minimum payment \nmay cover/covers only part of the interest you owe each month and none of the principal. The unpaid interest will be \nadded to your loan amount, which over time will increase the total amount you are borrowing and cause you to lose \nequity in your home.\" This proposed language describing negative amortization was developed by the Board \nthrough its consumer testing on closed-end mortgage loans, as discussed in the proposal issued by the Board on \nclosed-end mortgages published elsewhere in today's Federal Register. The Board believes that this proposed \nlanguage effectively communicates the risks of negative amortization pursuant to the statutory requirements.\n\n5b(c)(16) Transaction Requirements\n\n\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(10) provides that a creditor must disclose as part of the application disclosures any limitations \non the number of extensions of credit and the amount of credit that may be obtained during any time period, as well \nas any minimum outstanding balance and minimum draw requirements, stated as dollar amounts or percentages. \nThe Board proposes to move current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(10) to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(16) and revise it. Specifically, \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(16) provides that a creditor must disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures \nany limitations on the number of extensions of credit and the amount of credit that may be obtained during any time \nperiod, as well as any minimum outstanding balance and minimum draw requirements. In addition, consistent with \ncurrent \u00a7 226.5b(d)(10), proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(3) provides that the transaction requirements disclosed under \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(16) may be disclosed as dollar amounts or as percentages.\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(10)-1 provides that a limitation on automated teller machine usage need not be disclosed in \nthe application disclosures under current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(10) unless that is the only means by which the consumer can \nobtain funds. The Board proposes to move this comment to proposed comment 5b(c)(16)-1 without any revisions.\n\n5b(c)(17) Credit Limit\n\nCurrently, a creditor is not required to disclose in the application disclosures the credit limit that is being offered to \nthe consumer. Pursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for \nHELOC plans, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(17) to require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the \nearly HELOC disclosures the creditor limit applicable to the plan. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). As discussed in more \ndetail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1), participants in consumer testing conducted by \nthe Board on HELOC disclosures indicated that the credit limit was one of the most important pieces of information \nthat they wanted to know in deciding whether to open a HELOC plan.\n\n5b(c)(18) Statements About Fixed-Rate and -Term Payment Plans\n\nCurrent comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-2 provides that a creditor generally must disclose in the application disclosures terms \nthat apply to the fixed-rate and -term payment feature, include the period during which the feature can be selected, \nthe length of time over which repayment can occur, any fees imposed for the feature, and the specific rate or a \ndescription of the index and margin that will apply upon exercise of the feature.\n\nFor the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c), the Board proposes that if a \nHELOC plan offers both a variable-rate feature and a fixed-rate and -term feature during the draw period, a creditor \ngenerally must not disclose in the table all the terms applicable to the fixed-rate and -term feature. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c). Instead, the Board proposes to require a creditor offering this payment feature (in addition to a variable-\nrate feature) to disclose in the table the following: (1) A statement that the consumer has the option during the draw \nperiod to borrow at a fixed interest rate; (2) the amount of the credit line that the consumer may borrow at a fixed \ninterest rate for a fixed term; and (3) as applicable, either a statement that the consumer may receive, upon \nrequest, further details about the fixed-rate and -term payment feature, or, if information about the fixed-rate and -\nterm payment feature is provided with the table, a reference to the location of the information. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(18). Thus, under the proposal, a consumer would be notified in the table about the fixed-rate and -term \npayment feature, and could request additional information about this payment feature (if a creditor chose not to \nprovide additional information about this feature outside of the table).\n\nIn responding to a consumer's request prior to account opening for additional information about the fixed-rate and -\nterm feature, a creditor would be required to provide this additional information as soon as reasonably possible after \nthe request. See proposed comment 5b(c)-2. The following additional information disclosed about the fixed-rate and \n-term payment feature upon request (or outside the early HELOC disclosures table) would have to include in the \nform of a table: (1) information about the APRs and payment terms applicable to the fixed-rate and -term payment \nfeature, and (2) any fees imposed related to the use of the fixed-rate and -term payment feature, such as fees to \nexercise the fixed-rate and -term payment option or to convert a balance under a fixed-rate and -term payment \nfeature to a variable-rate feature under the plan. See proposed comment 5b(c)(18)-2. The Board believes that the \n\n\n\nabove approach to providing information to consumers about the fixed-rate and -term feature enables consumers \ninterested in this feature to obtain additional information about this optional feature easily and quickly, but does not \ncontribute to \"information overload\" for consumers in general.\n\n5b(c)(19) Required Insurance, Debt Cancellation or Debt Suspension Coverage\n\nCurrently, creditors are not required to provide any information about the insurance or debt cancellation or \nsuspension coverage, whether optional or required, in the application disclosures. If a creditor requires insurance or \ndebt cancellation or debt suspension coverage (to the extent permitted by state or other applicable law), the Board \nproposes new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(19) that would require a creditor to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures any fee for this coverage. In addition, proposed \u00a7 226.5a(b)(19) requires that a creditor also disclose in \nthe table a cross reference to where the consumer may find more information about the insurance or debt \ncancellation or debt suspension coverage, if additional information is included outside the early HELOC disclosures \ntable. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require \nadditional disclosures for HELOC plan. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). Proposed Samples G-14(D) and G-14(E) provide \nguidance on how to provide the fee information and the cross reference in the table. If insurance or debt \ncancellation or suspension coverage is required to obtain a HELOC, the Board believes that any fees required for \nthis coverage should be emphasized by being placed in the table; consumers need to be aware of these fees when \ndeciding whether to open a HELOC plan, because they will be required to pay the fee for this coverage every month \nin order to have the plan.\n\n5b(c)(20) Statement About Asking Questions\n\nPursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, \nthe Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(20) to require a creditor to disclose as part of the early HELOC disclosures \na statement that if the consumer does not understand any disclosure in the table the consumer should ask \nquestions. 15 U.S.C. 1637a(a)(14). Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to provide this disclosure \ndirectly below the table provided as part of the early HELOC disclosures, in a format substantially similar to any of \nthe applicable tables found in proposed Samples G-14(C), G-14(D), and G-14(E) in Appendix G. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(b)(2)(iv).\n\nConsumer testing on HELOC and closed-end mortgage disclosures conducted by the Board showed that many \nparticipants educated themselves about the HELOC and mortgage process through informal networking with family, \nfriends, and colleagues, while others relied on the Internet for information. To improve consumers' ability to make \ninformed decisions about credit, the Board proposes to require a creditor to disclose that if the consumer does not \nunderstand the disclosures contained in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures, the consumer should ask \nquestions.\n\n5b(c)(21) Statement About Board's Web Site\n\nPursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, \nthe Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(21) to require a creditor to provide as part of the early HELOC disclosures a \nstatement that the consumer may obtain additional information at the Web site of the Federal Reserve Board, and a \nreference to this Web site. Currently, an electronic copy of the HELOC brochure is available at the Board's Web site \nat http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/equity/homeequity.pdf. The Board plans to enhance its Web site to further \nassist consumers in shopping for a HELOC. Although it is hard to predict how many consumers might use the \nBoard's Web site, and recognizing that not all consumers have access to the Internet, the Board believes that this \nWeb site may be helpful to some consumers as they decide whether to open a HELOC plan. The Board seeks \ncomment on the content for the Web site.\n\n5b(c)(22) Statement About Refundability of Fees\n\n\n\nPursuant to the Board's authority in TILA Section 127A(a)(14) to require additional disclosures for HELOC plans, \nthe Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(22) to require a creditor to disclose as part of the early HELOC disclosures \na statement that the consumer may be entitled to a refund of all fees paid if the consumer decides not to open the \nplan and a cross reference to the \"Fees\" section in the table. Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to \ndisclose these statements directly below the table, in a format substantially similar to any of the applicable tables \nfound in proposed G-14(C), G-14(D) and G-14(E) in Appendix G. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(iv).\n\nAs discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(4) and (c)(5), under the proposal, a creditor \nwould be required to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures table circumstances in which a consumer could \nreceive a refund of all fees paid if the consumer decides not open the HELOC plan offered to the consumer. In \nparticular, a creditor must disclose in the table that a consumer has the right to receive a refund of all fees paid if \nthe consumer notifies the creditor that the consumer does not want to open the HELOC plan (1) for any reasons \nwithin three business days after the consumer receives the early HELOC disclosures; and (2) any time before the \nHELOC account is opened if any terms disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures change (except for the APR). In \naddition, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose an indication of which terms disclosed in the \nearly HELOC disclosures table are subject to change prior to account opening.\n\nAs discussed in the section-by-section to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2), the Board tested with consumers versions of the \nearly HELOC disclosures with the right to a refund of fees disclosures located near a statement that terms disclosed \nin the early HELOC disclosures are subject to change prior to account opening as one of the rights to a refund of \nfees relates to changes in terms offered on the HELOC prior to account opening. The Board also tested other \nversions of the early HELOC disclosures with these disclosures in the \"Fees\" section of the table. These tested \ndisclosure forms also included next to the statement about which terms in the table may change prior to account \nopening, a statement that the consumer may be entitled to a refund of all fees paid if the consumer decides not to \nopen the plan and a cross reference to the \"Fees\" section in the table provided as part of the early HELOC \ndisclosures.\n\nThe Board found through this testing that participants were more likely to notice and understand information about \nthe refundability of fees when it was included in the \"Fees\" section of the table. Thus, under the proposal, the Board \nproposes to require that the information about the refundability of fees be disclosed in the \"Fees\" section of the \ntable. In addition, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b(c)(22) to require a creditor to disclose as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures a statement that the consumer may be entitled to a refund of all fees paid if the consumer \ndecides not to open the plan and a cross reference to the \"Fees\" section in the table provided as part of the early \nHELOC disclosures. This statement and cross reference would be disclosed below the table, grouped together with \nother global statements that generally relate to the terms being disclosed in the table such as an indication of which \nterms disclosed in the table may change prior to account opening.\n\n5b(d) Refund of Fees\n\nThe proposal would redesignate paragraph 5b(g) as paragraph 5b(d) and comments 5b(g)-1, -2, -3, -4 as \ncomments 5b(d)-1, -2, -3, and -4, and revise these provisions. Current paragraph 5b(g), which implements TILA \nSection 137(d), requires a creditor to refund fees paid \"in connection with an application\" if any term required to be \ndisclosed under current section 226.5b(d) changes (other than a change due to fluctuations in the index in a \nvariable-rate plan) before the plan is opened and, as a result of the change, the consumer elects not to open the \nplan. See 15 U.S.C. 1647(d). Comment 5b(g)-1 explains that all fees paid must be refunded, including credit-report \nfees and appraisal fees, whether they are paid to the creditor or directly to third parties. Comment 5b(g)-3 specifies \nthat when a term is changed that was disclosed as a range (as permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(d)) and the resulting term \nfalls within the disclosed range, the consumer is not entitled to a refund of fees. Similarly, if the creditor discloses a \nthird-party fee as an estimate (as permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(d)) and those fees change, the consumer is not entitled \nto a refund of fees.\n\nUnder the proposal, the phrase \"in connection with the application\" would be deleted from both new \u00a7 226.5b(d) \nand comment 5b(d)-1. The Board views this phrase as unnecessary to describe the fees that must be refunded \n\n\n\nunder this paragraph. As indicated in current comment 5b(g)-1, the Board has long interpreted this phrase, when \nmodifying the term \"fees\" in both the statute and regulation, to mean any fees that the consumer has paid to the \ncreditor or a third party related in any way to obtaining a HELOC with the creditor.\n\nThe proposal also would eliminate from the provisions in new \u00a7 226.5b(d) and accompanying commentary any \nreferences to the consumer's being entitled to a refund of fees only if the consumer decides not to obtain a HELOC \nbecause of a change in terms. The proposal would instead provide that a refund is required if a disclosed term \nchanges before account opening and the consumer decides not to enter into the plan. Pursuant to the Board's \nauthority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments to the requirements in TILA necessary to effectuate the \npurposes of TILA, the Board proposes to eliminate the requirement that the consumer's reason for deciding not to \nenter into the plan must be that a term has changed. The Board believes that requiring consumers to prove their \nintent for deciding not to enter a plan, the initially disclosed terms of which have changed, and requiring creditors to \ndiscern consumer intent, are not practicable. In addition, the Board believes that when terms change, most \nconsumers who decide not to enter into the plan will decide not to do so because of the changed term.\n\nComment 5b(d)-3 would be revised to reflect that under the proposal, disclosing a range for the maximum rate \nwould no longer be permitted in the early HELOC disclosure table, nor would disclosing an estimate for a third-party \naccount-opening fee, in contrast to the current rule on third-party fees reflected in current comment 5b(g)-3. See \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10). Disclosing an account-opening fee as a range, however, would be permitted if the dollar \namount of the fee is not known at the time the disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(b) are delivered or mailed. See proposed \n\u00a7 226.5b(c)(11).\n\nThe proposal also would make conforming changes to reflect renumbered provisions in the proposal.\n\n5b(e) Imposition of Nonrefundable Fees\n\nThe proposal would redesignate paragraph 5b(h) as paragraph 5b(e) and comments 5b(h)-1, -2, and -3 as \ncomments 5b(e)-1, -2, and -3, and would revise these provisions. Current paragraph 5b(h), which implements TILA \nSection 137(e), obligates a creditor to refund any fee imposed within three business days of the consumer receiving \nthe application disclosures and brochure required under existing \u00a7 226.5b if, within that time period, the consumer \ndecides not to enter into the HELOC agreement. See 15 U.S.C. 1647(e). Comment 5b(h)-1 provides that if the \ncreditor collects a fee after the consumer receives the application disclosures and the HELOC brochure and before \nthe expiration of three business days, the creditor must notify the consumer--clearly and conspicuously and in \nwriting--that the fee is refundable for three business days. This comment also provides that if disclosures are mailed \nto the consumer, a nonrefundable fee may not be imposed until six business days after mailing, because footnote \n10d to the regulation provides that if the disclosures are mailed to the consumer, the consumer is considered to \nhave received them three business days after they are mailed.\n\nProposed comment 5b(e)-1 retains these requirements, but with technical changes, including changes to reflect \nthat, under the proposal, notice of the consumer's right to receive a refund must be included in the early HELOC \ndisclosure table required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b), and may not be provided as an attachment to the early \nHELOC disclosures. Further discussion of this requirement is in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 226.5b(c)(5). In \naddition, footnote 10d is moved into the main text of \u00a7 226.5b(e).\n\nProposed comment 5b(e)-4 provides that, for purposes of \u00a7 226.5b(e), the term \"business day\" has the more \nprecise definition used for rescission and for other purposes, meaning all calendar days except Sundays and the \nfederal holidays referred to in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6). For example, if the creditor were to place the disclosures in the mail on \nThursday, June 4, the disclosures would be considered received on Monday, June 8. The Board proposes to use \nthe more precise definition of \"business day\" for determining receipt of disclosures for purposes of \u00a7 226.5b(e) to \nconform to the Board's rules for determining receipt of disclosures for other dwelling-secured transactions under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.19(a)(1)(ii) and 226.31(c), as well as to the Board's recently adopted rules under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). See 74 FR \n23289 (May 19, 2009).\n\n\n\nUnder the proposal, the phrase \"in connection with the application\" would be deleted from new \u00a7 226.5b(e). The \nBoard views this phrase as unnecessary to describe the fees that must be refunded under this paragraph. As \nindicated in current comment 5b(g)-1, the Board has long interpreted this phrase, when modifying the term \"fees\" in \nboth the statute and regulation, to mean any fees that the consumer has paid to the creditor or a third party related \nin any way to obtaining a HELOC with the creditor.\n\nThe proposal also would make conforming changes to reflect proposed disclosure requirements and re-numbered \nprovisions, and to indicate that \"three days\" means, as indicated in the corresponding regulation text, \"three \nbusiness days.\"\n\n5b(f) Limitations on Home-Equity Plans\n\nTILA Section 137, implemented in \u00a7 226.5b(f), limits the changes that creditors may make to HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b. The proposal would amend and clarify these limitations by revising \u00a7 226.56 and accompanying Official \nStaff Commentary, and adding a new \u00a7 226.5b(g).\n\nThe proposal includes a number of significant changes to the rules restricting changes that creditors may make to \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. First, the proposal would amend \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii), which permits creditors to \nterminate and accelerate a HELOC if \"the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms of the agreement,\" to \nprohibit creditors from terminating and accelerating an account or taking lesser action permitted under comment \n5b(f)(2)-2, unless the consumer has failed to make a required minimum periodic payment within a specified time \nperiod after the due date for that payment. As discussed in more detail below, the Board is specifically proposing \nthat account action under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii) be prohibited unless the consumer has failed to make a required \nminimum periodic payment within 30 days of the due date. The Board is requesting comment on the \nappropriateness of this timeframe, or whether some other time period is more appropriate.\n\nSecond, the proposal would amend \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iv) to permit creditors to terminate and accelerate a home-equity \nplan if a federal law requires the creditor to do so. Similarly, the proposal would add a new \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(G) to \npermit creditors to suspend advances or reduce the credit limit if a federal law requires the creditor to do so.\n\nThird, in a new comment 5b(f)(3)-3, the proposal would clarify that Regulation Z's general limitation on changing \nterms does not prohibit a creditor from passing on to consumers bona fide and reasonable costs incurred by the \ncreditor for collection activity after default, to protect the creditor's interest in the property securing the plan, or to \nforeclose on the securing property.\n\nFourth, the proposal would add to comment 5b(f)(3)(v)-2 an example of a change that would be considered \ninsignificant under this provision: a creditor may eliminate a method of accessing a HELOC, such as by credit card, \nas long as at least one means of access that was available at account opening remains available to the consumer \non the original terms.\n\nFinally, the proposal would provide additional guidance and amend the rules in three major areas related to when a \ncreditor may temporarily suspend advances on a home-equity plan or reduce the credit limit: (1) Rules regarding \nwhen a creditor may suspend or reduce an account based on a significant decline in the property value (\u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) and existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6); (2) rules regarding when a creditor may suspend or reduce \nan account based on a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) and \nexisting comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-7); and (3) rules regarding reinstatement of accounts that have been suspended or \nreduced (proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g) and existing comments 5b(f)(3)(vi)-2, -3, and -4).\n\n5b(f)(2)(ii) Limitations on Action Taken for Failure To Meet the Repayment Terms\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(2)(ii) permits a creditor to terminate a HELOC and accelerate the balance if the consumer has \n\"fail[ed] to meet the repayment terms of the agreement for any outstanding balance.\" The corresponding statutory \nprovision reads similarly: \"A creditor may not unilaterally terminate any account * * * except in the case of * * * (2) \nfailure by the consumer to meet the repayment terms of the agreement for any outstanding balance.\" 15 U.S.C. \n1647(b)(2). Comment 5b(f)(2)(ii)-1 clarifies that a creditor may terminate and accelerate a plan under this provision \n\"only if the consumer actually fails to make payments.\" Thus, an account may not be terminated for a minor \npayment infraction, such as when a consumer sends a payment to the wrong address. Comment 5b(f)(2)-2 \ninterprets this provision to allow creditors to take an action short of terminating the plan and accelerating the \nbalance, such as temporarily or permanently suspending advances, reducing the credit limit, changing the payment \nterms, or requiring the consumer to pay a fee. A creditor may also provide in its agreement that a higher rate or fee \nwill apply in circumstances under which it could otherwise terminate the plan and accelerate the balance.\n\nProposal\n\nThe proposal would interpret the statute to mean that creditors may not, for payment-related reasons, terminate the \nplan and accelerate the balance or take certain actions short of termination and acceleration permitted under \ncomment 5b(f)(2)-2, unless the consumer has failed to make a required minimum periodic payment within 30 days \nafter the due date for that payment. The Board is specifically proposing that account action under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii) \nbe prohibited unless the consumer has failed to make a required minimum periodic payment within 30 days of the \ndue date, and requesting comment on whether this timeframe is appropriate, or whether some other time period is \nmore appropriate. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to issue provisions \nand make adjustments to the requirements of TILA that are necessary or proper to effectuate the statute's \npurposes. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(a).\n\nThe Board believes that specifying the type of payment infraction required to take action under this provision is \nnecessary to effectuate the purposes of TILA and Congress in enacting the Home Equity Loan Act (cited above). \nAccording to section-by-section clarifications in the Home Equity Loan Act, this provision specifically \"deals with the \nfailure of the borrower to actually make payments. It does not encompass minor transgressions such as \ninadvertently sending the payment to the wrong branch.\" 19 Creditors and consumer groups have expressed \nuncertainty about when an account may be terminated or other action taken under this provision, as well as \nconcerns that creditor practices in this regard vary widely. In particular, concerns have been raised about \"hair-\ntrigger\" terminations and other actions being taken on accounts due to minor late payments. 20 Some have pointed \nout that the plain language of this provision--the consumer \"fails to meet the repayment terms of the agreement\"--\narguably allows creditors to take an action that seems disproportionate to the consumer's actions, such as account \ntermination due to as little as a single-day delinquency.\n\n19 Section-by-Section Clarifications to H.R. 3011, the Home Equity LoanConsumer Protection Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-709, \nenacted on Nov. 23, 1988 (inserted by Rep. David Price), Congr. Rec., H4474 (June 20, 1988) (emphasis added).\n\n20 Board staff discussions with creditors revealed that creditors terminate HELOC accounts due to aconsumer's \"fail[ure] to meet \nthe repayment terms of the agreement\" for payment delinquencies ranging from 16 to 90 days. In addition to creditor practices, \nBoard staff have also considered court decisions such Cunningham v. Nat'l City, C.A. 1-08-CV-10936-RGS (Dist. Mass., Jan. 7, \n2009), in which the court held that termination of an account was permitted based on a seven-day delinquency, even though the \nconsumer paid within the contractual late fee courtesy period. Standard HELOC agreements reviewed by the Board typically \nincorporate the regulatory language allowing a creditor to terminate and accelerate an account or take certain lesser actions due \nto a consumer's \"fail[ure] to meet the repayment terms of the agreement,\" without specifying the number of days late a \nconsumer's payment may be before the account will be terminated or other action taken under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Board believes that the proposed interpretation of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions better carries \nout the legislative intent to protect consumers against (1) creditor practices that are unexpected and harmful, 21 and \n(2) actions based on \"minor\" payment infractions. 22 The Board believes, for example, that terminating a line based \non a payment that was late but made within a contractual late fee \"courtesy\" period is arguably unexpected and \nharmful; a consumer may have a reasonable expectation that no penalty will be imposed for a payment made within \na certain number of days after the due date where a late fee courtesy period has consistently been applied to an \naccount. In addition, the proposal acknowledges that payments may be late for reasons out of the consumer's \ncontrol, such as postal delays or automated funds disbursement errors. A delinquency threshold for taking action on \nthe account of more than 30 days would give consumers time to discover and correct the error. Finally, a consumer \nwho is more than 30 days delinquent will, in most cases, have missed at least two due dates--and thus will have \nwholly failed to make a payment. See existing comment 5b(f)(2)(ii)-1 (prohibiting termination and acceleration of an \naccount unless the consumer \"actually fails to make payments\"), n23\n\nOverall, the proposal is intended to strike a more equitable balance between creditors' need to protect themselves \nagainst risk (and, for depositories, to ensure their safety and soundness), and effective protection of HELOC \nconsumers from constraints on their credit privileges that do not correspond with reasonable expectations. \nConsumer protection would be enhanced by eliminating the opportunity for hair-trigger terminations and certain \nlesser actions for nominal delinquencies. In addition, the Board believes that a consumer would be more likely to \nexpect serious consequences for a delinquency of more than 30 days on a debt secured by the consumer's home \nthan on an unsecured credit card account. These protections arguably offset the risk to consumers that creditors \nnow terminating lines of credit based on delinquencies of 30 days or less (or that rarely terminate lines) will begin \nterminating accounts based on the proposed over-30-days delinquency rule.\n\nAt the same time, creditors would retain options to protect themselves from losses prior to a payment becoming \nmore than 30 days delinquent. Specifically, a creditor could impose late payment fees specified in the HELOC \nagreement. Creditors also could temporarily suspend or reduce accounts for a \"default of a material obligation\" \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C), as payment obligations are commonly considered material obligations. In effect, \nwhether a line can be terminated due to failure to meet a payment obligation as permitted under TILA depends on \nthe extent of the default (i.e., is a payment late by more than 30 days?); whereas whether a line can be temporarily \nsuspended or reduced depends on the nature of the obligation on which the consumer defaulted (i.e., is the \nobligation itself \"material\"?).\n\nThe Board requests comment on whether a failure to make a payment within 30 days is appropriate or whether \nsome other time period is more appropriate for permitting action under this provision. In this regard, the Board notes \nthat the 2009 Credit Card Act (cited above) has suggested considering a delinquency threshold of more than 60 \ndays. Specifically, the Credit Card Act adds a new section 171 to TILA (15 U.S.C. 1666j) to prohibit increasing the \nAPR on existing credit card balances unless the creditor has not received a minimum payment within 60 days after \nthe due date for the payment. See Credit Card Act, \u00a7 101(b). However, the Credit Card Act does not require that a \nconsumer must be 60 or even 30 days late before a creditor may terminate a credit card account; the Credit Card \nAct deals with when a credit card creditor may reprice balances on an account.\n\nThe Board also requests comment on whether the Board should consider any other payment infractions to be \nsufficient grounds for termination and acceleration (and permitted lesser actions).\n\n21 See, e.g., Remarks of Rep. St. Germain, Chair, House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs on H.R. 3011, the \nHome Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act of 1988, Public Law 100-709, enacted on Nov. 23, 1988, Congr.

David Price), Congr. Rec., H4474 (June 20, 1988).\n\n\n\n5b(f)(2)(iv) Terminations Required by Federal Law\n\nExisting \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iv) permits a depository institution to terminate and accelerate a HELOC plan if \"compliance \nwith federal law dealing with credit extended by a depository institution to its executive officers specifically requires \nthat as a condition of the plan the credit shall become due and payable on demand.\" The Board narrowly tailored \nthis additional provision permitting termination in light of Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act (implemented by \nRegulation O, 12 CFR Part 215) and Section 309 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. \nSee 57 FR 34676 (August 6, 1992).\n\nThe proposal would amend \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iv) to permit creditors to terminate and accelerate home-equity plans if a \nfederal law requires the creditor to do so, expanding this provision to cover other federal laws that may require a \ncreditor to terminate and accelerate a plan. \"Federal law\" under this provision is limited to any federal statute, its \nimplementing regulation, and official interpretations issued by the regulatory agency with authority to implement \nsuch statute and regulation.\n\nWith this revision, the Board intends to prevent the need to issue separate revisions to Regulation Z to account for \nany new federal law requiring creditors to terminate and accelerate plans under particular circumstances. Further \ndiscussion of the reasons for this proposal and requests for comment are found in the explanation below of a similar \nproposal designated as new \u00a7 226.5b(3)(vi)(G).\n\nRegarding this proposed provision, the Board requests comment on what additional examples of conflicts between \nRegulation Z's restrictions on account termination and other laws the Board should consider, if any. The Board also \nrequests comment on whether the definition of \"federal law\" should be broadened to include, for example, an order \nor directive of a federal agency.\n\n5b(f)(3) Limitations on Changes in Terms\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3) generally prohibits a creditor from changing the terms of a HELOC plan after it is opened. \nComment 5b(f)(3)-1 states that, for example, a creditor may not increase any fee or impose a new fee once the plan \nhas been opened, even if the fee is charged by a third party. This comment also provides that the change-in-terms \nprohibition applies to \"all features of a plan,\" even if the features are not required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b \n(i.e., on the application disclosures). Comment 5b(f)(3)-2, however, lists three charges that may be changed: (1) \nIncreases in taxes; (2) increases in premiums for property insurance (if excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(2)); and (3) increases in premiums for credit insurance (if excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(2)).\n\nThe proposal would first revise comment 5b(f)(3)-1 to remove the example of a charge that is not required to be \ndisclosed--specifically, a late-payment fee. Under the proposal, a late-payment fee would not be required to be \ndisclosed in the early HELOC disclosure table under \u00a7 226.5b(b) (see proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), (c)(12) and \n(c)(13)), but it would be required to be disclosed on the account-opening table under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(x), \nalong with several other types of fees. Further discussion of these proposed rules is included in the section-by-\nsection analysis for proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2).\n\nSecond, proposed comment 5b(f)(3)-3 clarifies that creditors may pass on to consumers costs in the limited \ncategories of debt collection, collateral protection and foreclosure under Regulation Z, but only if certain conditions \nare present. First, the costs must \"bona fide and reasonable,\" meaning that the creditor may pass on to the \nconsumer only costs that the creditor actually incurs in taking these actions on a particular plan, and that the \namount of any costs passed on to the consumer must be reasonably related to any services related to debt \ncollection, collateral protection or foreclosure incurred by the creditor. These costs might include attorneys' fees, \ncourt costs, property repairs, payment of overdue taxes, or paying sums secured by a lien with priority over the lien \nsecuring the HELOC. Second, the need for the creditor's actions must arise due to the consumer's default of an \nobligation under the agreement.\n\n\n\nDuring outreach to prepare this proposal, the Board received requests to clarify whether creditors may pass on to \nconsumers bona fide and reasonable costs incurred by the creditor for collection activity after default, to protect the \ncreditor's interest in the property securing the plan, and to foreclose on the securing property. Creditors have \nexpressed uncertainty about whether a creditor may pass these types of costs on to consumers under Regulation \nZ. As noted, \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3) prohibits creditors from changing the terms of a home-equity plan except in specified \ncircumstances. Existing comment 5b(f)(3)-2 lists only three types of fees that are not covered by this section. Thus, \nit could be argued that creditors may not pass certain costs on to consumers unless they disclose in the agreement \nthe specific fees and amounts associated with actions required for debt collection, collateral protection and \nforeclosure. The Board understands that the specific amount of costs required for a creditor to collect unpaid \namounts, protect its collateral or execute foreclosure can rarely be known at the outset of a home-equity plan. \nEvents giving rise to the need for a creditor to take action for debt collection, collateral protection or foreclosure may \noccur several years after the opening of a plan, and the specific actions required for collateral protection or \nforeclosure, for example, may vary widely depending on the circumstances, such as the nature of the consumer's \naction or inaction giving rise to the need for the creditor to take affirmative action protect its collateral, or the rules of \nthe jurisdiction governing the foreclosure proceeding. The Board recognizes that for closed-end home-secured \ncredit, creditors have more certainty than do HELOC creditors that these costs may be passed on to the consumer \nwithout specific upfront disclosure of their amounts, and that this uncertainty for HELOCs creates compliance \nchallenges.\n\nAlso, other sections of the existing commentary reflect the Board's longstanding recognition that specific disclosure \nof these items and the amount of the charge for each may be difficult. For example, comment 5b(d)(4)-1 \n(redesignated in the proposal as comment 5b(c)(7)(i)-1) excludes from the requirement to disclose termination fees \nat application \"fees associated with collection of the debt, such as attorneys' fees and court costs.\" In addition, \nlongstanding comment 6(b)-2.ii (incorporated with changes into proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii)(B)) excludes from \ndisclosure in the \u00a7 226.6 account-opening statement \"[a]mounts payable by a consumer for collection activity after \ndefault; attorney's fees, whether or not automatically imposed; foreclosure costs; [and] post-judgment interest rates \nimposed by law,\" among others. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis under proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3), one category of \"charges imposed as part of a home-equity plan\" would be \"charges resulting from the \nconsumer's failure to use the plan as agreed, except amounts payable for collection activity after default; costs for \nprotection of the creditor's interest in the collateral for the plan due to default; attorney's fees whether or not \nautomatically imposed; foreclosure costs; and post-judgment interest rates imposed by law\" (emphasis added). \nProposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) generally parallels \u00a7 226.6(b)(3)(ii)(B) applicable to open-end (not home-secured) plans \nfinalized in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule and incorporates, as noted, longstanding comment 6(b)-2.ii.\n\nThe Board is mindful of concerns that consumers may be charged a wide array of fees upon default without \nadequate notice or explanation. For these reasons, the Board requests comment on the appropriateness of this \nproposed clarification. The Board also requests comment on whether, if the proposal is adopted, the Board should \nclarify requirements regarding disclosure of these costs in the initial agreement beyond stating that specific \namounts need not be disclosed. For example, would it be sufficient for the creditor to disclose simply the possibility \nthat costs under the three categories contemplated in the proposal--debt collection, collateral protection and \nforeclosure upon default--may be charged? Or should the creditor be required to itemize in whole or in part the \ntypes of costs under each category that could be charged?\n\n5b(f)(3)(i) Changes Provided for in Agreement\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3)(i) provides exceptions from the general prohibition on changes in terms of home-equity plans. \nOne of these \"exceptions\" is that a creditor may provide in the initial agreement that a specified change will take \nplace if a specified event occurs. The section gives an example that the agreement may provide that the APR may \nincrease by a specified amount if the consumer leaves the creditor's employment. Comment 5b(f)(3)(i)-1 clarifies \nthat both the triggering event and the resulting change in terms must be stated in the agreement with specificity. \nThe comment also restates the employee preferred-rate example, and gives other examples, including a stepped-\nrate provision in the agreement, under which specified changes in the rate may take place after specified periods of \n\n\n\ntime. This section and accompanying comment are consistent with the general principle stated in comment 5b(f)(1)-\n3 that rate changes specifically set forth in the agreement are not prohibited.\n\nThe Board proposes to revise comment 5b(f)(3)(i)-1 to clarify that rate increases are also permissible upon the \noccurrence of special circumstances other than those set forth in the existing comment, as long as they are \nspecifically set forth in the agreement and do not conflict with other substantive limitations on rate changes in the \nregulation. The Board intends this clarification to provide consistency between comment 5b(f)(1)-3 and comment \n5b(f)(3)(i)-1. The proposal also would limit the amount by which a rate could be increased once circumstances \nqualifying the consumer for a preferred rate no longer apply. Specifically, a creditor could not raise the rate to be \nhigher than it would have been had the consumer never qualified for a preferred rate. If a preferred rate of five \npercent is available to a consumer who is an employee of the creditor, for example, and the rate applicable if the \nconsumer were not a creditor employee were seven percent, the creditor could not raise the rate above seven \npercent once the consumer is no longer the creditor's employee. The Board believes that such an increased rate \nwould constitute a penalty rate imposed for reasons not permitted under Regulation Z. See \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) and \ncomment 5b(f)(2)-2; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1647(a); \u00a7 226.5b(f)(1).\n\nThe revised comment would clarify that the creditor could not impose a penalty rate for a reason other than those \nspecified in \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) (allowing termination and acceleration and certain lesser actions only under particular \ncircumstances). The Board believes that permitting agreements to provide for the application of penalty rates upon \nthe occurrence of any triggering event would be inconsistent with the restrictions on rate increases under the statute \nand regulation. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1647(a); \u00a7 226.5b(fl(1). Thus, the proposed comment would state that the creditor \nwould be permitted to increase the rate to a penalty rate level only if the triggering event is a circumstance that \nwould permit the rate to be increased under the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2), such as fraud or material \nmisrepresentation by the consumer (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(i)), failure to make a required payment within 30 days of the due \ndate for that payment (proposed \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii)), or action or inaction by the consumer that adversely affects the \ncreditor's security interest for the plan (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iii)). The Board believes, however, that a rate increased from \na preferred rate to the rate available to consumers generally, when the condition for the preferred rate is no longer \nmet, would be consistent with the statutory provision. A consumer who has a preferred rate is likely to be aware of \nthe conditions for the rate, and thus if the conditions are no longer met, the rate increase would not come as an \nundue surprise.\n\n5b(f)(3)(iv) Beneficial Changes\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3)(iv) permits a creditor to change a term of a home-equity plan if the change \"will unequivocally \nbenefit the consumer throughout the remainder of the plan.\" Comment 5b(f)(3)(iv)-1 gives several examples of \nbeneficial changes, including a temporary reduction in the rate or fees charged during the plan. In this case, \nhowever, the comment indicates that a creditor \"may\" be required to give a change-in-terms notice required under \u00a7 \n226.9(c) (see proposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)) when the rate or fees return to their original level.\n\nThe proposal would clarify in comment 5b(f)(3)(iv)-1 that a change-in-terms notice \"would,\" rather than \"may,\" be \nrequired to be provided to the consumer under \u00a7 226.9(c) (proposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)) when the temporarily reduced \nrate or fees are returned to their original level, if these reductions and subsequent increases were not disclosed in \nthe account agreement. The revised comment also would clarify that including notice of the increased rate or fee \nwith the notice to the consumer that the rate or fee is being reduced would constitute appropriate notice of the \nincrease, as long as this notice is provided 45 days before the effective date of the increase.\n\nComment 9(c)(1)(ii)-2 (redesignated in the proposal as comment 9(c)(1)(iv)-2) states that a creditor may offer \ntemporary reductions in finance charges without giving notice when the charges return to their original level--as long \nas this feature is disclosed in the account-opening disclosures required under \u00a7 226.6 (including an explanation of \n\n\n\nthe terms upon resumption). 24 The \"beneficial changes\" provision, however, permits the creditor temporarily to \nreduce finance charges such as rates and fees without disclosing these possible reductions in the account \nagreement (assuming the change is \"unequivocally\" beneficial). When a creditor relies on this provision to raise the \nrate or fees after the reduction period has ended, however, the Board believes that the consumer should be given \nnotice of when these charges will return to their original level in accordance with the proposed 45 days advance \nnotice rule under proposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). This would ensure that the consumer is given sufficient notice of the \nchange to make any financial adjustments necessary.\n\n5b(f)(3)(v) Insignificant Changes\n\nBackground\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3)(v) permits a creditor to make \"insignificant\" changes to a home-equity plan's terms. Existing \ncomment 5b(f)(3)(v)-1 explains that this provision is intended to \"accommodate[] operational and similar problems, \nsuch as changing the address of the creditor for purposes of sending payments.\" Under this comment, a creditor \nmay not change a term such as a late-payment fee. Comment 5b(f)(3)(v)-2 gives several examples of changes in \nterms considered \"insignificant.\" These include \"minor changes\" to the billing cycle date, the payment-due date, and \nthe day of the month on which index values are measured; changes to the creditor's rounding practices for the \nAPR; and changes to the balance computation method used. The comment also provides that these changes will \nnot in all cases be considered \"insignificant.\" For example, a change to the payment-due date would be insignificant \nonly if this change would not diminish the grace period, if any, during which finance charges and late fees are not \napplied to new transactions. A change in the creditor's rounding practices for disclosing the APR would be \ninsignificant only if the change is within the tolerances prescribed by \u00a7 226.14(a). A change to the balance \ncomputation method would be insignificant only if any resulting difference in the finance charge paid by the \nconsumer is \"insignificant.\"\n\nA number of creditors have expressed concerns to the Board about difficulties arising when the servicing of a \nHELOC is transferred and the new servicer's platform is not programmed to allow for previously available terms. \nCreditors are concerned that changing the terms of a HELOC in this circumstance may not be permitted due to \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)'s limitations on term changes. Creditors have reported that, as a result, they sometimes have to use \nmultiple servicers or servicing systems to support all the terms of the various HELOCs they acquire. These \nservicers and servicing systems may be of widely varying quality, which could mean that consumers do not receive \noptimal service on their HELOCs. Some creditors have reported that a portfolio acquisition may not occur at all if \nthe acquirer's servicing system cannot support the terms of the HELOCs offered, and that this may also harm \nconsumers if, for example, the proposed acquisition was necessitated in part by challenges facing the current \nservicer. Differences between servicing systems cited by creditors may impact, among other terms, rate indices, \nminimum payment and late fee calculations, or the availability of certain payment options or access devices such as \ncredit cards.\n\nProposal\n\n24 This provision also states that temporary reductions in payments disclosed in theaccount-opening statement are subject to the \nnotice exemption. See comment 9(c)(1)(ii)-2 (proposed comment 9(c)(1)(iv)-2). Temporary payment reductions might also be \nconsidered beneficial changes permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(1)(3)(iv). See comment 5b(f)(3)(iv)-1. However, in the Supplementary \nInformation to the final rule implementing \u00a7 226.51)(1)(3)(iv), the Board noted that \"reducing the amount of the minimum \npayment would not be unequivocally beneficial since it may result in less principal being repaid over the term of the plan and \nmay result in a higher total amount of finance charges.\" 54 FR 3063 (Jan. 23, 1989).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Board proposes to add to comment 5b(f)(3)(v)-2 an example of a change that would be considered insignificant \nunder this provision: a creditor may eliminate a method of accessing the line, such as a credit card, as long as at \nleast one means of access that was available at account opening remains available to the consumer on the original \nterms. The Board also proposes to clarify that changes to the original terms on which a means of access was \noriginally available--such as any fees for using the access method--would not be considered insignificant, but might \nbe permitted as \"beneficial\" changes under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iv) if the change met the requirements of comment \n5b(f)(3)(iv)-1.\n\nThe Board believes that a general rule permitting changes in terms due to servicing transfers would not sufficiently \nprotect consumers, and thus would undermine the purpose of the change-in-terms restrictions mandated by TILA. \nSuch a rule would allow creditors to change terms as a result of a servicer change that are, in practical effect, \nsignificant. Changes to minimum payment calculations, for example, could increase the overall costs to the \nconsumer of the HELOC, or materially increase the consumer's payments in the short or long term. Changes to late \nfee calculations could be confusing to consumers and cause undue surprise related to the amount or timing of the \nlate-payment fee; in addition, longstanding Board policy prohibits changing fees charged for late payments. See \ncomment 5b(f)(3)(v)-1.\n\nThe Board also considered setting a general standard for changes that would be considered insignificant, such as \nallowing changes to be deemed insignificant that result in the same or substantially similar payments (including \nperiodic payments and the total of payments), rates, fees, and overall loan costs. One concern about establishing a \ngeneral standard is that confusion among creditors and consumers, and possibly increased litigation, may result, \nparticularly concerning the meaning of terms such as \"substantially similar.\" The Board requests comment on \nwhether setting a general standard for term changes that would be considered insignificant is desirable. In this \nregard, the Board also requests comment on whether prescribing specific tolerances for resulting payments, costs, \nand fees would be helpful, and what appropriate tolerances might be.\n\nServicing transfers, while sometimes beneficial to consumers, are neither initiated nor controlled by consumers. \nThus, the Board believes that consumers should not in general be subjected to changes in their HELOC terms \nwhen their servicing is transferred. The current regulation provides several exceptions allowing creditors to change \nHELOC terms in keeping with the consumer protection purpose of TILA and Regulation Z--such as changes by \nwritten agreement (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iii)), beneficial changes (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iv)), and insignificant changes (\u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(v)). Regarding insignificant changes, current comment 5b(f)(3)(v)-2, as noted, clarifies in its examples \nthat, in effect, a change cannot be considered insignificant if it diminishes or eliminates a financial benefit to the \nconsumer, such as a grace period, or if it causes the consumer to pay a finance charge that is more than nominally \nhigher than the finance charge that would have applied under the original terms.\n\nRather than make a broad revision such as permitting all term changes related to servicing transfers or setting a \ngeneral standard for determining whether a change in terms is \"insignificant,\" the Board is proposing to clarify that \nan access device such as a credit card may be eliminated as long as previously available access devices remain \navailable. Creditors indicated that significant problems can arise where credit card access, for example, was \navailable on the plan but a new servicer cannot support this; the creditor may be unable to transfer the servicing or \nmay have to make individual arrangements with each consumer. The Board requests comment on the \nappropriateness of this additional example of an insignificant change. In addition, the Board requests comment on \nwhether this example, if adopted, should be modified, broadened, or narrowed.\n\n5b(f)(3)(vi) Temporary Suspension of Credit or Reduction of Credit Limit\n\nIntroduction\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3)(vi) lists several circumstances under which a creditor may temporarily suspend advances on a \nhome-equity plan or reduce the credit limit. As discussed below, the Board proposes revisions to this section in \nthree major areas: (1) Rules regarding when a creditor may suspend or reduce an account based on a significant \n\n\n\ndecline in the property value (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) and existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6); (2) rules regarding when a \ncreditor may suspend or reduce an account based on a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances \n(\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) and existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-7); and (3) rules regarding reinstatement of accounts that \nhave been suspended or reduced (existing comments 5b(f)(3)(vi)-2, -3, and -4). As also discussed below, the \nproposal would permit a creditor to suspend or reduce an account temporarily if required to do so by federal law. \nCertain technical amendments are proposed to \u00a7 226.5b(f) and accompanying commentary as well.\n\nChanges and Requests for Comment Related to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi) Generally\n\nNo changes are proposed to existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-1, which provides that a creditor may temporarily \nsuspend advances on an account or reduce the credit limit only under circumstances specified in \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi), \n\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) when the maximum annual percentage is reached, or \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2), permitting suspension of \nadvances or reduction of the credit limit in lieu of terminating and accelerating the account. See comment 5b(f)(2)-2. \nThe Board requests comment, however, on the portion of this comment providing that the creditor's right to reduce \nthe credit limit does not permit reducing the limit below the amount of the outstanding balance if this would require \nthe consumer to make a higher payment. Specifically, the Board requests whether other limitations on the amount \nby which a home-equity line may be reduced may be appropriate. For example, should the amount by which a \ncredit line may be reduced for a significant decline in the property value under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) (discussed \nbelow) be limited to: (1) No more than the dollar amount of the property value decline; (2) no more than the amount \nneeded to restore the creditor's equity cushion at origination (and whether, in this case, the relevant equity cushion \nshould be the dollar amount or the percentage of the home value not encumbered by debt); or (3) some other \nmeasure? A related request for comment is whether a creditor should be prohibited from temporarily suspending \nadvances on the line until, for example, the property value declines by the full amount of the credit line.\n\nThe proposal would redesignate comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-5 as comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-2 and make certain technical \nrevisions. Current comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-5 permits a creditor to honor a specific request by a consumer to suspend \ncredit privileges. If two or more consumers are obligated under a plan and each can take advances, comment \n5b(f)(3)(vi)-5 permits creditors to provide that any of the consumers may direct the creditor not to make further \nadvances. This comment also permits a creditor to require that all persons obligated under a home-equity plan \nrequest reinstatement.\n\nProposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-2 would add that consumers may request not only suspended advances but \nreduction of the credit limit. It also clarifies that when a consumer later requests reinstatement, but a condition \npermitting suspension or reduction exists (under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) or (f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi)), a creditor that therefore \ndoes not re-open the plan must provide the disclosure of the specific reasons for the action taken under \u00a7 \n226.9(j)(1) (for temporary suspensions and reductions under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi)) or (j)(3) (for termination \nor permitted lesser actions under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)), as applicable. Concerns were expressed to the Board during \noutreach for this proposal that under some circumstances, a person with an ownership interest in the property \nsecuring the line, but who is not obligated on the plan, may wish to request suspension of advances. The Board has \nnot proposed a change to this provision to address these concerns, but invites comment on the issue.\n\nUnder longstanding Board policy, rate changes for reasons permitting suspension of advances or credit limit \nreductions under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi) have been prohibited. See comment 5b(f)(3)(i)-2. Based on issues \nraised during the Board's outreach to prepare this proposal, the Board also requests comment on whether and \nunder what circumstances it might be appropriate for Regulation Z to permit actions other than temporary \nsuspension of advances or credit limit reductions under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi).\n\nFinally, as discussed in more detail under the section-by-section analysis for proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g), the proposal \nmoves comments 5b(f)(3)(vi)-2, -3, and -4 regarding reinstatement of accounts to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g) and \naccompanying commentary, and revises them.\n\n5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) Suspensions and Credit Limit Reductions Based on a Significant Decline in the Property Value\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A), which implements TILA Section 137(c)(2)(B), permits a creditor temporarily to suspend \nadvances or reduce a credit line on a HELOC if \"the value of the dwelling that secures the plan declines \nsignificantly below the dwelling's appraised value for purposes of the plan.\" 15 U.S.C. 1647(c)(2)(B). Comment \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)-6 states that whether a decline in value is significant under this provision \"will vary according to \nindividual circumstances.\" The comment goes on to provide a \"safe harbor\" standard for determining whether a \ndecline is significant. Specifically, a decline in value would be considered significant if it results in the initial \ndifference between the credit limit and the available equity (the \"equity cushion\") diminishing by 50 percent or more.\n\nConcerns have been expressed to the Board that the existing safe harbor may not be a viable standard for the \nhigher combined loan-to-value (CLTV) HELOCs made in recent years. For loans nearing or exceeding 100 percent \nCLTV when originated, for example, a decline in value of a few dollars could result in more than a 50 percent \ndecline in the creditor's equity cushion because the equity cushion was zero or close to zero at origination. For \nthese higher CLTV loans in particular, creditors have indicated uncertainty about how to determine whether a \ndecline in value is \"significant.\" For their part, consumer advocates have expressed concerns that the lack of \nguidance on the proper application of the safe harbor gives creditors too much authority to take action based on \nnominal declines in value. Finally, noting that appraisals are not required to take action under this provision (see \ncomment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6), creditors have also asked the Board for guidance on appropriate property valuation \nmethods for assessing property values under this provision.\n\nProposal\n\nThe proposal would eliminate references to the \"appraised\" value in both the regulation and commentary, to reflect \nthat appraisals are not required to originate many HELOCs, 25 nor are they required to establish a basis for taking \naction under this provision. See existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6. Beyond this technical change, the proposal would \nrevise the commentary interpreting \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) in two principal ways. First, the commentary would \ndelineate two \"safe harbors\" on which creditors could rely to determine that a decline in property value is \n\"significant\" under this section. Second, the commentary would provide additional guidance regarding the \nappropriate valuation tools for creditors to use in valuing property under this section.\n\nProposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-4 confirms existing guidance stating that whether a decline is \"significant\" under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) depends on the individual circumstances of a particular HELOC secured by a property whose \nvalue has declined. Thus, in all cases the creditor must make an individualized assessment of whether a property \nvalue decline is significant, and may not solely consider general property value trends.\n\nSafe harbors. To facilitate compliance, the Board proposes two standards under which a property value decline \nwould be deemed significant under this section.\n\n25 See, e.g., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision, \"Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines,\" SR Letter 94-55 (Oct. 28, \n1994); see also 12 CFR 225.63 (FRB); 12 CFR 34.43 (OCC); 12 CFR 323.3 (FDIC); 12 CFR 564.3 (OTS). \"Appraisal\" is defined \nin federal banking agency regulations relating to appraisal standards as \"a written statement independently and impartially \nprepared by a qualified appraiser setting forth an opinion as to the market value of an adequately described property as of a \nspecific date(s), supported by the presentation and analysis of relevant market information.\" 12 CFR 225.62(a) (FRB); 12 CFR \n34.42(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 323.2(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 564.2(a) (OTS).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. First, for plans with a CLTV at origination of 90 percent or higher, a five percent reduction in the property value on \nwhich the HELOC terms were based would constitute a significant decline in value for purposes of \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A).\n\n. Second, for plans with a CLTV at origination of under 90 percent, the Board proposes to retain the existing safe \nharbor, under which a decline in the value of the property securing the plan is significant if, as a result of the \ndecline, the initial difference between the credit limit and the available equity (based on the property's value for \npurposes of the plan) is reduced by 50 percent.\n\nFive percent decline for HELOCs with a CLTV at origination of 90 percent or higher. The current commentary allows \ncreditors to assume that a decline in property value is \"significant\" if the decline results in a 50 percent decline in \nthe creditor's equity cushion. See comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6. The Board proposes to modify this \"safe harbor\" for loans \nwith a CLTV at origination of 90 percent or higher: For these loans, the creditor could assume that a decline in the \nproperty value is significant if the property value declines at least 5 percent from its value when the HELOC was \noriginated.\n\nThe Board proposes this new safe harbor for several reasons. First, the current safe harbor, which allows action on \na HELOC when the creditor's equity cushion falls by 50 percent, establishes an inappropriate metric for measuring \nwhether a value decline on higher CLTV loans is \"significant.\" As worded, this provision arguably permits action \nbased on nominal property value declines. Specifically, the statute permits suspension of advances or reduction of \nthe credit limit when the value of property securing the HELOC \"is significantly less than the value of the property \nwhen the HELOC was originated. 15 U.S.C. 1647(c)(2)(B). The Board's proposal would interpret this statutory \nlanguage to mean that, at minimum, the actual decline in value must be more than nominal. The 5 percent safe \nharbor thus is intended to protect consumers with higher CLTV HELOCs from having their lines suspended or \nreduced based on property value declines that are only slightly less than the value of the property at origination.\n\nSecond, the new proposed safe harbor standard would be consistent with the existing safe harbor. Arithmetically, a \nfive percent decline on loans with an originating CLTV of 90 percent or higher results in at least a 50 percent \ndecline in the equity cushion. By contrast, a five percent property value decline on loans with an originating CLTV of \nunder 90 percent would not reduce the creditor's equity cushion by 50 percent.\n\nThird, the proposed CLTV threshold of 90 percent or higher for applying a five percent value decline safe harbor \nwould be consistent with a CLTV threshold already established by the Board. Specifically, Board risk management \nguidance defines a \"high (C)LTV loan\" 26 generally as a loan with a CLTV of 90 percent or higher, unless the loan \nhas credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance to mitigate the risk of loss. 27 Research validates that loans \nin this category have a higher probability of default and yield greater losses upon default than loans of lower CLTVs. \n28\n\n26 Relevant guidance uses the term \"LTV\" (loan-to-value ratio) to mean what is often referred to as \"CLTV\" (combined loan-to-\nvalue ratio); in other words, all liens on the property are considered: \"[A] high LTV residential real estate loan is defined as any \nloan, line of credit, or combination of credits secured by liens on or interests in owner-occupied 1- to 4-family residential property \nthat equals or exceeds 90 percent of the real estate's appraised value, unless the loan has appropriate credit support.\" Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \nOffice of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Administration, \"Interagency Guidance on High LTV Residential Real Estate \nLending,\" SR Letter 99-26 (Oct. 12, 1999) (emphasis added).\n\n27 12 CFR part 208, subpart E, app. C (providing that, if a loan's LTV is equal to or exceeds 90 percent, the creditor must add \nother credit enhancements (such asmortgage insurance) or the loan will be considered to exceed the supervisory LTV ratios and \nbe deemed a \"high LTV loan,\" to which additional rules apply). See also Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SR \nLetter 99-26 (Oct. 12, 1999).\n\n28 See, e.g., Kristopher Gerardi, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Andreas Lehnert and Shane M. Sherlund, Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System, and Paul Willen, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, \"Making Sense of the Subprime Crisis,\" \nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity (Fall 2008). See also, Min Qi and Xiaolong Yang, Office of the Comptroller of the \n\n\n\nRetention of existing safe harbor for HELOCs with a CLTV at origination of lower than 90 percent. For loans with an \noriginating CLTV of less than 90 percent, the Board proposes to retain the existing the safe harbor, under which a \nvalue decline is significant if the decline results in the creditor's equity cushion contracting by 50 percent. Comment \n5b(f)(3)(vi)-4 clarifies that in determining whether a decline results in a 50 percent equity cushion reduction, the \ncreditor may, but does not have to, consider any changes in available equity based on the status of the first \nmortgage.\n\nThe Board proposes to retain the existing safe harbor for several reasons. First, no parties during Board outreach to \nprepare this proposal objected to the general principal that a property value decline resulting in a 50 percent \nreduction of the equity cushion can reasonably be considered \"significant\" under this provision.\n\nSecond, applying this safe harbor to loans with CLTVs of under 90 percent does not depart significantly from the \nassumption on which the original safe harbor example was based. See comment \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)-6. The \ncommentary illustrates the existing safe harbor with a HELOC at a starting CLTV of 80 percent; thus, the illustration \nindicates that a 50 percent equity cushion reduction would be significant for loans originated with a CLTV of 80 \npercent. The proposal clarifies that a property value decline resulting in a 50 percent equity cushion reduction is \nsignificant for loans with a CLTV of only somewhat higher than 80 percent--under 90 percent.\n\nFinally, there is an arithmetical basis for applying the existing safe harbor, rather than the proposed flat five percent \ndecline safe harbor, to HELOCs with an originating CLTV of under 90 percent: a five percent decline in the value of \nthe property for lines with a starting CLTV lower than 90 percent would not yield an equity cushion decline of 50 \npercent or more.\n\nAmong other alternatives, the Board considered proposing a safe harbor that applied a flat percentage property \nvalue decline to all HELOCs, regardless of the originating CLTV, but determined that defining an single metric \nappropriate for all loans was not possible. A safe harbor of a 10 percent decline, for example, may impair creditors' \nflexibility to take action where reasonable arguments could be made, as for higher CLTV loans such those \ndiscussed above, that adequate risk mitigation requires action based on a lesser decline. At the same time, a 10 \npercent decline may be inappropriate for loans with lower CLTVs, such as 50 percent. For these loans, a 10 percent \nproperty value decline would still leave the creditor with a significant equity cushion. By contrast, even on lower \nCLTV loans, the current safe harbor of a 50 percent reduction in the creditor's equity cushion might reasonably be \ndeemed a sufficient change in the creditor's original risk level to justify action on the line, such as temporarily \nreducing the credit limit.\n\nSignificant declines outside of the safe harbors. The Board recognizes that not all property value declines that might \nreasonably be considered \"significant\" for taking action under this provision will fall into one of the two safe harbors. \nThus, the Board requests comment on whether and what guidance regarding other factors that creditors might \nconsider in determining whether a decline is significant is desirable. Specific comment is requested on whether the \nBoard should provide guidance clarifying that the creditor may (but does not have to) consider any changes in \navailable equity based on how much the consumer owes on a mortgage with a lien superior to that of the HELOC. \nOn a second-lien HELOC where the first-lien mortgage is negatively amortizing, or was negatively amortizing during \nany part of the HELOC term, for example, the CLTV will decline more and faster than if the first mortgage were fully \nor partially amortizing, concomitantly reducing the HELOC creditor's equity cushion. The actual property value \n\nCurrency, \"Loss Given Default of High Loan-to-Value Residential Mortgages,\" Economics and Policy Analysis Working Paper \n2007-4 (August 2007).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ndecline alone may not reduce the creditor's equity cushion by 50 percent, but a 50 percent reduction in the equity \ncushion may nonetheless occur if the first mortgage loan is negatively amortizing.\n\nThe Board also requests comment on whether and under what circumstances it may be appropriate to permit \nconsideration of a clear and consistent trend of declining property values in the market area in which the securing \nproperty is located. The Board understands that creditors commonly rely on general market data to validate findings \nfor a property-specific valuation; used in this way, general market data may be a valuable quality control tool \ncontributing to sound portfolio management. (Depending on comments received, the Board would not anticipate \nthat consideration of this factor would be permissible unless the creditor first completed a property valuation that \naccounts for specific characteristics of the subject property and meets other guidelines proposed in comment \n5b(f)(3)(vi)-5.) In addition, the Board solicits comment on the type of market data that would be appropriate, such as \ndata based on publicly available, empirically-based research, as well as on whether a more specific definition of \n\"market area\" would be needed and, if so, what definition would be appropriate.\n\nFinally, as discussed above under the section-by-section analysis on \u00a7 5b(f)(3)(vi) (specifically concerning comment \n5b(f)(3)(vi)-1), the Board requests comment on what, if any, restrictions on the amount by which a credit line may be \nreduced for a significant decline in value may be appropriate.\n\nProperty valuation methods. Existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6 states that \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) does not require a \ncreditor to obtain an appraisal before suspending credit privileges or reducing the credit limit based on a significant \ndecline in value, although a significant decline must have occurred. This means that the creditor must be able to \ndemonstrate that a significant value decline in value has occurred, even if an appraisal is not obtained. To establish \nthis basis when the creditor does not obtain an appraisal, the creditor would have to rely on a property value \ngenerated by a valuation method other than an appraisal. Proposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-5 reaffirms that an \nappraisal is not required to take action under this provision, but provides additional guidance about the valuation \ntools that may be appropriate and the standards that should apply to using these tools.\n\nProposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-5 would clarify that appropriate property valuation methods under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) may include, but are not limited to, automated valuation models (AVMs), 29 tax assessment \nvaluations (TAVs), 30 and broker price opinions (BPOs). 31 These examples of appropriate valuation tools are \nillustrative; the Board recognizes that the methods named in the commentary may in the future commonly be \nreferred to by other names, and that new valuation methods that may be appropriate could be developed over time. \nCreditors would not be able to use any valuation method if state or other applicable law prohibits using that method \nfor determining whether to suspend or reduce credit lines. For example, some state laws permit real estate brokers \nor salespersons to perform BPOs only as part of the real estate sales or listing process. 32\n\n29 An automated valuation model or \"AVM\" is a computer program that analyzes data to determine a property's market value. \n\"Hedonic\" models use property characteristics (such as square footage, room count) on the subject and comparable properties \nto determine a value. \"Index\" models determine value based on repeat sales in the marketplace rather than property \ncharacteristic data. \"Blended or hybrid\" models use elements of both hedonic and index models.\n\n30 A tax assessment valuation or \"TAV\" determines the value of the subject property based on the value established for property \ntax purposes.\n\n31 A broker price opinion or \"BPO\" is an estimate of value of the subject property prepared by a real estate broker, agent or sales \nperson that details the probable listing price of the subject property and provides varying level of detail about the property's \ncondition, market, and neighborhood, and information on comparable sales. A BPO does not include use of an AVM.\n\n32 See, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 17-14-104, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-526, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 82B.035, R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 5-20.7-3, Tex. \nOcc. Code \u00a7 1103.004.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUnder proposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-5, any property valuation method on which the creditor relies to take action \nunder this section must consider specific property characteristics of the underlying collateral. Methods that use only \nindices measuring property values generally in a particular geographic area would not be appropriate. Thus, AVMs \nknown as \"hedonic\" or \"hybrid\" (also referred to as \"blended\") models that account for specific property \ncharacteristics and location to produce a value would generally be appropriate, whereas AVMs known as \"repeat \nsales index\" or \"home price index\" models that do not account for property characteristics specific to the underlying \ncollateral would not be appropriate. 33\n\n5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) Suspensions and Credit Limit Reductions Based on a Material Change in the Consumer's Financial \nCircumstances\n\nBackground\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B), which implements TILA Section 137(c)(2)(C), permits a creditor to suspend advances or \nreduce the credit limit of a HELOC when \"the creditor reasonably believes that the consumer will be unable to fulfill \nthe repayment obligations of the plan because of a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances.\" 15 \nU.S.C. 1647(c)(2)(C).\n\nIn the Board's discussions with creditor representatives and others, concerns have been raised that the phrase \n\"unable to meet\" the repayment obligations is inappropriate in the modern credit market, in which credit decisions \ngenerally involve ranking consumers by their likelihood of repaying, not on whether they can or cannot repay. The \nBoard understands that, in effect, a creditor may decide not to extend credit because a consumer's likelihood of \ndefault is calculated to be, for example, 15 percent over a given period. A 15 percent likelihood of default, however, \ndoes not necessarily show that the consumer is \"unable\" to repay the HELOC on the agreed terms. The Board also \nrecognizes that credit availability may be reduced if the circumstances under which creditors may take action under \nthis provision are ambiguous. One creditor expressed to the Board that uncertainty about how to fulfill the \nrequirements of this provision contributed to the creditor's decision to stop offering HELOCs altogether. In sum, \nmany creditors have requested more detailed guidance about when action is permissible under this provision, \nincluding the extent to which they may rely on declines in credit scores.\n\nConsumer advocates expressed dissatisfaction with the guidance on \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) as well, voicing concerns \nthat the lack of clear guidelines results in some creditors taking action on accounts of consumers who are fully \ncapable of meeting their repayment obligations or whose financial circumstances in fact have not changed in a \nmanner truly supporting a reasonable belief that the consumer will be unable to meet these obligations.\n\nProposal\n\nAs an initial matter, the Board is not proposing to eliminate the phrase \"unable to meet\" the repayment terms from \nthe regulatory text, in part because the statute itself stipulates that the creditor must have \"reason to believe that the \nconsumer will be unable to comply with the repayment requirements of the account due to a material change in the \nconsumer's financial circumstances.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1647(c)(2)(C) (emphasis added). Legislative history does not \nexplain Congress's decision to set this standard; the Board interprets the statute's \"unable\" to pay standard as \nevincing a legislative intent to promote creditor restraint in taking action under this provision. At the same time, the \nBoard, as did Congress, recognizes the need for creditors to be able to protect themselves against losses on home-\n\n33 See supra note 29, regarding \"hedonic,\" \"hybrid,\" and \"index\" AVMs.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nequity lines; 34 TILA and Regulation Z therefore permit creditors to take action on accounts in certain circumstances \nbefore the creditor begins to incur losses on those accounts. See 15 U.S.C. 1647(c)(2)(13)--(E); \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A)-(F).\n\nThus, the Board requests comment on whether the Board should consider expressly interpreting the \"unable\" to pay \nstandard to mean, for example, that the change in the consumer's financial circumstances resulted in the \nconsumer's likelihood of default \"substantially\" increasing. Another possible interpretation on which the Board \nrequests comment is that the \"unable\" to pay standard requires that, as a result in a change in the consumer's \nfinancial circumstances, the consumer moved into a higher default risk category than at origination (based on the \nstatistical likelihood of default), such that the creditor would not have made the loan or would have made the loan \non materially less favorable terms and conditions.\n\nOverall, the proposed revisions to guidance in the commentary on \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) is intended to protect \nconsumers by ensuring that creditors exercise prudent judgment in relying on this provision, while providing certain \nlimited clarifications regarding the requirements of this provision to guide creditors. To ensure that before taking \naction, creditors carefully consider the consumer's financial circumstances and the likely impact of these \ncircumstances on the account, the proposed commentary retains the existing two-part test for justifying account \nsuspensions or credit limit reductions under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B). The creditor must first examine the consumer's \nfinancial circumstances and determine whether a \"material\" change has occurred. The Board interprets the word \n\"material\" in this part of the test to mean that the change has some bearing on the consumer's ability to pay his or \nher financial obligations. The creditor must then establish that this change supports the creditor's reasonable belief \nthat the consumer will be unable to meet the repayment obligations of the HELOC. The proposal would revise the \ncommentary interpreting \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) to include additional examples of how creditors may demonstrate that \nboth parts of the test are met, as discussed below.\n\nFor the first part of the test, under proposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6 (based on existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-7 with \nrevisions), evidence of a significant change in financial circumstances includes, but is not limited to, a significant \ndecrease in the consumer's income, or credit report information showing late payments or nonpayments on the \npart of the consumer, such as delinquencies, defaults, or derogatory collections or public records related to the \nconsumer's failure to pay other obligations. The Board proposes to require that these payment failures must have \noccurred within a reasonable time from the date of the creditor's review of the consumer's credit performance. A \nsafe harbor for determining whether a payment failure occurred within a reasonable time from the date of the \ncreditor's review would be one that occurred within six months of the creditor's suspending advances or reducing \nthe credit limit. In addition, the consumer cannot have brought the account on which the payment failure occurred \ncurrent as of the time of the creditor's review. The Board believes that this six-month safe harbor appropriately \nobserves the statutory and regulatory rule that action can be taken only \"during any period in which\" the consumer's \nfinancial circumstances have materially worsened from those on which the credit terms were based. See 15 U.S.C. \n1647(c)(2)(C); \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B). The Board solicits comment on this approach.\n\nMeeting the second part of the test requires that the change in financial circumstances support the creditor's \nreasonable belief that the consumer will be unable to fulfill the payment obligations of the plan. For this part of the \ntest, the proposal retains the existing commentary's safe harbor--namely, that the creditor may rely on evidence of \nthe consumer's failure to pay other debts other than the HELOC to support a reasonable belief that the consumer \n\n34 See Remarks of Rep. David Price (primary sponsor of the H.R. 3011, the Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act of \n1988, Pub. L. 100-709, enacted on Nov. 23, 1988, Congr. Rec., H4473 (June 20, 1988) (\"[T]hese provisions protect the \nconsumer without hindering the ability of lenders to operate successfully equity credit plans.\").\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nwill not be able to meet the HELOC's repayment obligations. Proposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6 adds that these \npayment failures must have occurred within a reasonable time from the date of the creditor's review of the \nconsumer's credit performance, with the six-month safe harbor discussed above.\n\nProposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-6 also specifies that for the second prong of the test, the payment failures on which \nthe creditor relies may not be solely late payments of 30 days or fewer. The Board does not believe that a late \npayment of 30 days or fewer is adequate evidence of a failure to pay a debt. For example, the consumer's payment \nmay not have reached the creditor due to errors of which the consumer has not yet had an opportunity to become \naware, such as mail delivery or electronic funds transfer errors.\n\nReliance on Credit Score Declines\n\nSeveral industry representatives requested clarity on whether creditors could rely on credit score declines to satisfy \nthe requirements of \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B). The Board believes that credit score declines may be an appropriate \nscreening tool for determining which consumers to examine more closely for potential action based on this \nprovision. However, the Board is concerned about whether credit score declines alone can meet the required \nstatutory showing. For reasons discussed below, the proposal neither endorses nor prohibits reliance on credit \nscore declines alone to meet the requirements of this provision, but solicits comment on this issue.\n\nPermitting reliance on credit scores alone to satisfy the requirements of this provision raises several concerns. First, \na Board study has observed that credit scores can drop for reasons unrelated to the consumer's actual failure to \npay obligations, 35 which suggests that a credit score decline alone might be an insufficient basis to satisfy the two-\npart test. Credit scores sometimes drop, for example, due to increases in a consumer's utilization rate on her credit \ncards or because a consumer closes one or more credit card accounts. But an increased utilization rate may occur \nbecause a credit card creditor decides to reduce the credit limit for reasons out of the consumer's control, not \nbecause the consumer is relying more heavily on credit card credit. Similarly, if the consumer closes accounts \nbecause the consumer has consolidated these debts into a single, lower interest loan, the consumer may have \nfreed up more income to repay the HELOC; here, the consumer's credit score drop in fact corresponds with \nimprovement in the consumer's ability to pay.\n\nSecond, standard credit scores do not show a consumer's actual default or delinquency probability--they reflect \nonly a consumer's likelihood of falling delinquent or defaulting relative to other consumers. For example, a \nconsumer with a score of 700 is less likely to default than a consumer with a score of 600--but these scores by \nthemselves do not indicate the actual probability that either consumer will default.\n\nThird, the Board also recognizes the challenge of defining how much of a decline is sufficient to satisfy the \nstandard. Applying a single metric such as a 40 point decline to all consumers is especially problematic, because a \nconsumer whose score declines from 800 to 760 is still much more likely to be able to pay than, for example, a \nconsumer whose score decreases from 600 to 560. In addition, different scoring models use different score ranges, \nso a decline of 40 points on one model would not have the same meaning as a 40-point decline in another model.\n\nFourth, any expected future debt performance associated with consumers having a given credit score (relative to \nconsumers with different scores) can change over time based on macroeconomic conditions. For example, a \nconsumer with a credit score of 700 in Year One may have better future debt performance than a consumer with a \nscore of 700 in Year Three, if the macroeconomic conditions have worsened from Year One to Year Three. This is \n\n35 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \"Report to the Congress on Credit Scoring and Its Effects on the \nAvailability and Affordability of Credit\" (August 2007).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nbecause all consumers will have lower average debt performance levels in Year Three. But again, credit scores \nshow only a credit performance rank of one consumer compared to other consumers, not an actual default \nprobability. Thus, to rely on credit score declines alone to meet the requirements of this exception, creditors may \nalso have to account for macroeconomic changes.\n\nIn sum, without additional sophisticated empirical analysis, a creditor could not show that a particular consumer's \ncredit score decline corresponds to an increased default probability that would meet either prong of the two-part \ntest.\n\nAt the same time, the Board does not believe that expressly prohibiting reliance on credit scores alone under this \nprovision is desirable. A black-and-white rule prohibiting reliance on credit scores to take action under this provision \ncould be overly restrictive for at least two reasons. First, the Board understands that some creditors may have a \nstrong empirical basis for relying on credit scores for a particular HELOC portfolio. The Board recognizes that \ncreditors may be able to show that a particular level of drop is always associated with significant negative payment \nhistory, for example. Second, the Board's prohibition could become outdated or unnecessarily constraining on \ncreditors in using innovative credit scoring tools developed in the future. Credit scoring methods may change over \ntime in a manner that makes them more decisively indicative of default probability than today.\n\nFor these reasons, the proposal neither expressly permits nor prohibits reliance on credit scores alone to determine \nthat action is justified under this provision. The Board requests comment on the appropriateness of this approach, \nas well as whether and why the Board should consider expressly permitting or prohibiting reliance on credit scores \nto meet the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B).\n\nIn addition, the Board requests comment on the following questions: What compliance challenges are posed by the \nproposed standards for meeting each prong of the test? What further guidance for compliance with this provision, \nincluding examples of well-defined, reasonably reliable indicators of compliance with each prong of the test, should \nthe Board consider? For example, should reliance on factors not related to past credit performance, but that may \nindicate poor future performance, be sufficient grounds for taking action under this provision? In this regard, the \nBoard recognizes that, notwithstanding the discussion above, factors such as increases in the consumer's \nutilization rate and the number of new accounts opened have been shown to correspond to a reduced capacity of \nthe consumer to repay his or her financial obligations. 36\n\n5b(f)(3)(vi)(C) Default of a Material Obligation\n\nUnder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C), which implements TILA Section 137(c)(2)(D), a creditor may temporarily suspend or \nreduce an account if \"the consumer is in default of a material obligation under the agreement.\" 15 U.S.C. \n1647(c)(2)(D). Proposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-7 would clarify that a creditor \"must,\" rather than \"may,\" specify which \nconsumer obligations are \"material\" for purposes of this provision, if any. This clarification is intended to ensure that \nRegulation Z is interpreted to reflect the statutory requirement, found in TILA Section 137(c)(3), that the consumer \nmust be given upon the consumer's request and at the time of account opening a list of the contract obligations that \nare considered \"material\" for purposes of TILA Section 137(c)(2)(D), which is the statutory provision permitting a \ncreditor to suspend or reduce a line of credit \"during any period in which the consumer is in default with respect to \nany material obligation of the consumer under the agreement.\" See 15 U.S.C. 1647(c)(3) (cross-referencing 15 \nU.S.C. 1647(c)(2)(D)).\n\n36 Id.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5b(f)(3)(vi)(G) Suspensions and Credit Limit Reductions Required by Federal Law\n\nBackground\n\nDuring outreach conducted by the Board in preparing the proposal, creditors pointed out that the federal Internet \ngambling law (the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 or the \"Internet Gambling Act\"), 31 U.S.C. \n5361-5367, and implementing regulations, 37 require non-exempt financial institutions and other participants in \npayment systems to have and comply with policies and procedures that, among other things, \"identify and block \nrestricted transactions.\" 38 Rules administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") also require \ncreditors to block accounts under certain circumstances. 39 Creditor representatives raised concerns about the \npotential for claims against creditors that prohibit draws to comply with the Internet Gambling Act or other federal \nlaws, because TILA and Regulation Z do not expressly permit creditors to refuse to grant credit in those \ncircumstances.\n\nProposal\n\nSimilar to the proposed amendments to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iv), discussed above, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(G) would \npermit creditors to suspend advances or reduce the credit limit if a federal law other than TILA requires the creditor \nto do so. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(G) is intended to resolve the conflict between Regulation Z and federal laws \nthat require creditors to block HELOC advances or reduce credit limits under circumstances not otherwise permitted \nunder Regulation Z. Proposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-9 would clarify that this rule permits creditors to prohibit either a \nsingle advance or multiple advances, depending on what the applicable federal law requires. By covering federal \nlaws generally, this proposed section is intended to prevent the need for the Board to issue separate revisions to \nRegulation Z to account for any new federal law requiring creditors to suspend advances or reduce credit limits \nunder particular circumstances.\n\nThe Board believes that this proposal is consistent with longstanding policy expressed in provisions that permit \ncreditors to suspend an account or reduce the credit limit temporarily due to government action. See 15 U.S.C. \n1647(c)(2)(E); \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D) and (E). Specifically, TILA and Regulation Z allow creditors to take these actions \nwhen the government precludes them from imposing the contractual APR or when government action adversely \naffects the priority of the creditor's security interest such that the creditor's secured interest in the property is less \nthan 120 percent of the credit limit on the account. 15 U.S.C. 1647(c)(2)(E); \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D) and (E).\n\nRegarding this proposed section, the Board requests comment on what additional examples of conflicts between \nRegulation Z's restrictions on account action and other laws the Board should consider, if any. The Board also \nrequests comment on whether the definition of \"federal law\" should be broadened to include, for example, an order \nor directive of a federal agency.\n\n5b(g) Reinstatement of Credit Privileges\n\nBackground\n\n37 12 CFR. Part 233 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System); 31 CFR part 132 (U.S. Department of Treasury).\n\n38 31 U.S.C. 5362(7) (defining \"restricted transaction\"). See also 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5364: 12 CFR 233.5; 31 CFR 132.5 (requiring \ninstitutions to establish policies and procedures under the Internet Gambling Act).\n\n39 See 31 CFR 500.201, .202, .203.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi) permit creditors to suspend advances on an account or reduce the credit limit \nonly \"during any period in which\" designated circumstances exist. See also 15 U.S.C. 1647(c)(2)(B)--(E). The Board \nhas long interpreted this language to indicate that reinstatement of credit privileges is required once no \ncircumstances permitting a freeze or credit limit reduction under the statute or regulation exist. To facilitate \ncompliance, the Board provided guidance on appropriate reinstatement practices in the Official Staff Commentary \non this provision. See comments 5b(f)(3)(vi)-2, -3, -4.\n\nRecently, due to declining property values and for other reasons, HELOCs have been suspended and credit limits \nreduced more often than in the past. Consumer groups and other federal agencies have raised concerns about \nwhether consumers are properly informed about the creditor's obligation to reinstate credit lines and consumers' \nrights to request reinstatement. The Board has also examined the reinstatement practices of several creditors and \ndetermined that additional guidance is appropriate.\n\nProposal\n\nThe proposal would revise several provisions regarding reinstatement of credit privileges currently in comments \n5b(f)(3)(vi)-2, -3 and -4, and move them to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g) and comments 5b(g)-1, 5b(g)(1)-1, 5b(g)(2)(i)-1, \nand 5b(g)(2)(ii)-1. Proposed explanatory guidance regarding the reinstatement rules is found in proposed \ncommentary on \u00a7 226.5b(g).\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(g) and comment 5b(g)-1 (adopted from existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-2 with revisions) confirm \nthat line suspensions and credit limit reductions under both \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi) must be temporary and \nthat, accordingly, the creditor is obligated to restore the consumer's credit privileges as soon as reasonably possible \nonce no condition permitting the creditor's action exists, such as reaching the maximum APR or a significant decline \nin the value of the property securing the line. See comments 5b(f)(3)(vi)-1 and -2 and proposed comment 5b(g)-1. \nThis new paragraph and comment 5b(g)-1 are also intended to clarify that the creditor is not obligated to restore \ncredit privileges if the original condition permitting the action no longer exists but another condition permitting the \ncreditor to freeze the line or reduce the credit limit exists.\n\nProposed comment 5b(g)-2 is adopted from existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-3, with certain technical revisions. The \nproposed comment retains the existing prohibition on charging a fee to reinstate an account, and specifies that this \nfee prohibition applies when no condition permitting an account freeze or reduction exists.\n\n5b(g)(1) Methods of Meeting the Obligation To Reinstate Accounts\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(1) and comment 5b(g)(1)-1 are adopted from existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-4, with revisions. \nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(1) retains the existing two options for a creditor to fulfill its obligation to ensure that the \nconsumer's credit privileges are restored as soon as reasonably possible after no circumstance permitting a freeze \nor credit limit reduction exists. First, a creditor may monitor the line on an ongoing basis to determine whether the \ncondition permitting the freeze or credit line reduction continues to exist or another condition exists. Proposed \ncomment 5b(g)(1)-1 requires creditors choosing this option to investigate the HELOC often enough to be certain \nthat a condition permitting the action exists. How often a creditor must investigate depends on the individual \ncircumstances of a particular situation. For example, in a market with long-term property value declines that publicly \navailable, independently verifiable data show are continuing, a creditor might reasonably decide not to investigate \nthe property value as often as might be reasonable if the trend of property values begins increasing.\n\nThe second compliance option permits creditors to forego ongoing monitoring and instead require the consumer to \nrequest reinstatement. This option is available only if the creditor complies with the provisions of \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2), \ndescribed below. During outreach for this proposal, the Board was asked to consider requiring ongoing monitoring \nin all cases, rather than allowing creditors to shift the burden to consumers to request reinstatement. Proposals to \nstrengthen requirements on creditors that require consumers to request reinstatement, as discussed below, were \nintended in part to address concerns about allowing creditors to require consumers to request reinstatement. The \n\n\n\nBoard requests comment on requiring ongoing monitoring in all cases, including specific information about potential \nbenefits and burdens of this approach.\n\n5b(g)(2) Obligations of Creditors That Require the Consumer To Request Reinstatement\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(i), adopted from existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-4, requires that if the creditor requires the \nconsumer to request reinstatement, the creditor must disclose this requirement on the notice of action taken \nrequired under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1). As does existing \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii) and comment 9(c)(1)(iii)-1, proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) \nrequires the creditor to disclose, among other things, the method by which the consumer must request \nreinstatement, such as whether the request must be in writing and the address to which a written request must be \nsubmitted.\n\nUnder \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(ii), as under the existing commentary (see comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-4), the creditor's receipt of a \nreinstatement request triggers the creditor's obligation investigate whether the condition permitting the freeze or \ncredit line reduction exists. See comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-4. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(3)(ii), however, would require the \ncreditor to complete the investigation within 30 days of receiving the reinstatement request. The Board is proposing \na 30-day investigation rule to conform to the longstanding policy requiring creditors to investigate reinstatement \nrequests \"promptly\" upon receiving a request. See comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-4. Based on information on creditor \npractices, the Board believes that the time required to complete a reinstatement investigation may vary. If a new \nproperty valuation is the primary element of the investigation, creditors may be able to complete the investigation in \nas little as a few days. If the creditor must depend on financial information requested from the consumer to \ncomplete an investigation, the investigation may take longer, although the Board also believes that once a creditor \nreceives the financial information necessary to determine whether the original finding regarding a consumer's \nfinancial circumstances continues to exist, most creditors should be able to evaluate this information in a few days. \nIn sum, the Board understands that a reinstatement investigation typically will not take more than two to three \nweeks to complete.\n\nThe Board therefore proposes to require that the creditor complete the investigation and mail a notice of \nreinstatement results (see proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(v), discussed in the section-by-section analysis below) within 30 \ndays of receiving the consumer's reinstatement request. The Board requests comment on whether this timeframe is \nappropriate and whether the Board should consider additional guidance for creditors when consumers do not \nprovide needed information to complete the investigation in a timely manner. Such guidance might, for example, \nrequire that the creditor request the information within a reasonable period of time after receiving the reinstatement \nrequest, and permit the creditor to delay sending the notice until a reasonable period of time after receipt of the \nrequested information.\n\nProposed comment 5b(g)(2)(ii)-1 also provides guidance on investigating a reinstatement request. Specifically, the \ninvestigation should involve verifying that the information on which the creditor relied to take action in fact pertained \nto the specific property securing the affected line (as with a property valuation) or to the specific consumer (as with \na credit report). In addition, to investigate whether a significant decline in property value exists under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A), the creditor should reassess the value of the property securing the line based on an updated \nproperty valuation meeting the guidance in proposed comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-5, discussed above. To investigate \nwhether a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances exists under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B), the creditor \nshould obtain and evaluate financial information sufficient to validate the original finding on which the action was \nbased.\n\nClarification on Fees. Current comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-3, \"Imposition of fees,\" states that, if not prohibited by state law, \na creditor may collect bona fide and reasonable appraisal and credit report fees actually incurred in investigating \nwhether the condition permitting the freeze continues to exist. The proposal would move this part of the comment to \n\u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(iii) and (g)(2)(iv) and revise it. (The general prohibition in existing comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-3 on imposing \na fee to reinstate an account once a condition permitting a freeze or reduction no longer exists would be \nincorporated into the proposal at comment 5b(g)-2.)\n\n\n\nFirst, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(iii) and (iv) would use the term \"property valuation\" rather than \"appraisal,\" reflecting \nthat an appraisal will not necessarily be the valuation method used to investigate a reinstatement request. Beyond \nthis technical change, proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(iii) would grant the consumer one reinstatement request \ninvestigation free of charge. That is, for consumers required by the creditor to request reinstatement, the regulation \nwould prohibit a creditor from charging the consumer any fees for investigating the consumer's first reinstatement \nrequest after each time the line is frozen or reduced. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(iv) would permit a creditor to charge \nbona fide and reasonable property valuation and credit report fees only for investigations of reinstatement requests \nother than the consumer's initial request after a line is suspended or reduced.\n\nThe Board proposes these rules pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to issue provisions and make \nadjustments to the requirements of TILA necessary or proper to effectuate the statute's purposes. See 15 U.S.C. \n1604(a). This proposal is intended to ensure that consumers have a meaningful opportunity to exercise their right to \nrequest reinstatement and to have this request investigated. Assessing an appraisal fee, for example, before the \ncreditor will investigate the request may be a hardship for some consumers; in effect, up-front charges for the initial \nreinstatement investigation may discourage those consumers who are potentially the most in need of their HELOC \nfunds from requesting reinstatement. The proposal is also intended to protect consumers for whom the original \nreason for the account freeze or credit limit reduction turned out to have been incorrect from having to pay extra \ncosts for their HELOCs, and from the potential burden of having to pay expenses upfront.\n\nThis proposal is based in part on information about creditor practices suggesting that investigation costs may not be \nparticularly burdensome for creditors. The Board understands that credit reports and many valuation methods may \nbe available to a creditor at low cost, particularly when the creditor can take advantage of bulk rates for these \nservices. Further, the Board believes that potential burdens on creditors of the above proposal are adequately offset \nby proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(iv), which would permit creditors to charge reasonable and bona fide property valuation \nand credit report fees associated with investigations triggered by reinstatement requests after the consumer's first \nrequest. The Board is proposing this approach to address concerns about the time and expense associated with \nhaving to investigate multiple reinstatement requests made by a consumer in a period of time insufficiently long to \nsupport a reasonable expectation that the condition justifying the line action has changed. At the same time, the \nconsumer's right to request reinstatement as many times as desired is retained, as are existing limits on the types \nof investigation fees that creditors may charge.\n\nThe Board requests comment on this approach, including whether consumers should have to pay reinstatement \ninvestigation costs for any reinstatement request. The Board also requests comment on whether, if the first \nreinstatement request is free but fees may be charged for subsequent requests, a consumer should be required to \npay investigation costs for a subsequent reinstatement request made a significant time period after the first request, \nsuch as six months, one year, or other appropriate time period commenters might suggest. Finally, the Board \nrequests comment on whether the Board should consider requiring that the amount of the fees be disclosed along \nwith the notice that the consumer must request reinstatement, and the burdens and benefits of this requirement.\n\nNotice of Reinstatement Results. Proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(v) would require creditors that choose to have the \nconsumer request reinstatement under \u00a7 226.5b(g)(1)(ii) to disclose to the consumer the results of the investigation \nof the consumer's reinstatement request. This notice requirement would apply only for investigations conducted in \nresponse to a consumer's request for reinstatement and only when the investigation results show that \nreinstatement is not warranted, either because the condition permitting the freeze or credit limit reduction continues \nto exist, another condition permitting a freeze or credit line reduction under Regulation Z exists, or both. The notice \nmust be in writing, and must include the results of the investigation, as well as the information required in the \u00a7 \n226.9(j)(1) notice, such as the specific reasons for the continued freeze or credit limit reduction and information \nabout the consumer's ongoing right to request reinstatement. To facilitate compliance with this provision, the Board \nis proposing Model Clauses in G-22(A) and G-22(B) of Appendix G to Regulation Z.\n\nThe Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to issue provisions and make \nadjustments to the requirements of TILA necessary or proper to effectuate the statute's purposes. See 15 U.S.C. \n1604(a). The Board recognizes that this new notice requirement will present a compliance cost on creditors who do \n\n\n\nnot already have a policy of disclosing reinstatement results to their consumers. The Board believes, however, that \nthe benefits of this notice requirement outweigh the burden. First, the Board believes that this provision upholds the \nconsumer protection purpose of TILA by ensuring that consumers are adequately informed about the status of their \nHELOC accounts and responds to concerns expressed to the Board that currently many consumers are not. With \nthis notice, consumers would be better equipped to take appropriate action, such as working to improve their credit \nor making alternative financial plans. In addition, the Board anticipates that this notice requirement may reduce \nconsumer requests and complaints, because transparent investigation results will help consumers better \nunderstand the reasons for continued freezes or reductions and assure consumers that their reinstatement requests \nwere considered.\n\nThe Board requests comment on this disclosure requirement, and on whether creditors also should be required to \nprovide notice of reinstatement results to consumers whose accounts will be reinstated, but with the option to \nprovide notice orally to these consumers.\n\n5b(g)(3) Obligation To Make Document Supporting Property Valuation Available to the Consumer\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2) would require a creditor, upon the consumer's request, to provide to the consumer a copy \nof the documentation supporting the property value on which the creditor relied to freeze or reduce a line, or to \ncontinue an existing line freeze or reduction, based on a significant decline in the property value under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(vi)(A). Proposed comment 5b(g)(2)1 would explain that the appropriate documentation under this \nprovision would include a copy of a report for the valuation method used, such as an appraisal report, or any written \nevidence of another valuation method used (such as an AVM, TAV, or BPO) that clearly and conspicuously shows \nthe property value specific to the subject property and factors considered to obtain the value.\n\nThe Board believes that consumers should have access to information about the property value on which action \nwas relied because a line suspension or reduction may result in serious financial consequences to consumers. In \nlight of the significance of the impact on the consumer of the creditor's actions, the consumer should be fully \nequipped with necessary information to challenge the finding or otherwise request reinstatement.\n\nThe Board requests comment on the appropriateness of this requirement, as well as the operational practicality for \ncreditors of obtaining and providing the required documentation.\n\n5b(g)(4) Reinstatement Rules for Action Taken Under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)\n\nProposed paragraph (g)(4) of \u00a7 226.5b would clarify that, when a creditor has a justification for terminating and \naccelerating a home-equity plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2), but opts to suspend or reduce the line instead, the creditor is \nnot obligated to comply with the reinstatement rules of proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g). This provision is intended to respond \nto questions posed to the Board about whether, when a creditor has a justification for terminating and accelerating a \nhome-equity plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2), but opts to suspend or reduce the line instead, the creditor is obligated to \ncomply with the reinstatement rules of proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g). The Board believes that this clarification is consistent \nwith the existing reinstatement scheme.\n\nFirst, reinstatement guidance is in the commentary only for \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi), the provision permitting a creditor \ntemporarily to suspend advances or reduce the credit limit, reflecting longstanding Board policy that it applies only \nwhen action is taken under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi) (or under (f)(3)(i); see comments 5b(f)(3)(vi)-1 and -2). Second, the \nBoard believes that applying the reinstatement rules to suspensions or line reductions taken when the creditor could \nterminate and accelerate a line may harm consumers; a creditor may be discouraged from choosing the lesser \naction of temporarily suspending advances or reducing the credit limit if additional rules apply to those actions. \nThird, the Board believes that compliance confusion may arise, as well as enforcement challenges, in determining \nto which line suspensions and reductions under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) the reinstatement rules should apply. Existing \ncommentary on \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) gives the creditor the right to suspend or reduce an account \"temporarily or \npermanently.\" See comment 5b(f)(2)-2 (retained in the proposal). Logically, the reinstatement rules could only apply \nwhen the creditor chooses to take temporary action, but both creditors and examiners may have difficulty \n\n\n\ndetermining and documenting which line actions are intended to be temporary (and thus subject to the \nreinstatement rules) and which permanent. Again, creditors may be inclined simply to make all suspensions and \nreductions under this provision permanent, potentially harming consumers to whom creditors might otherwise have \ngiven an opportunity to restore their credit privileges.\n\nSection 226.6 Account-Opening Disclosures\n\nTILA Section 127(a), implemented in \u00a7 226.6, requires creditors to provide information about key credit terms \nbefore an open-end plan is opened, such as rates and fees that may be assessed on the account. Consumers' \nrights and responsibilities in the case of unauthorized use or billing disputes are also explained. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a). \nSee also Model Forms G-2 and G-3 in Appendix G to part 226.\n\n6(a) Rules Affecting Home-Equity Plans\n\nSummary of Proposed Disclosure Requirements\n\nAccount-opening disclosure and format requirements for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b generally were unaffected by \nthe January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, consistent with the Board's plan to review Regulation Z's disclosure rules for \nhome-secured credit in a future rulemaking. To facilitate compliance, the Board in the January 2009 Regulation Z \nRule grouped the requirements applicable to HELOCs together in \u00a7 226.6(a) (moved from former \u00a7 226.6(a) \nthrough (e)).\n\nThis proposal contains two significant proposed revisions to account-opening disclosures for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b, which are set forth in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a). The proposed revisions (1) would require a tabular summary of \nkey terms to be provided before an account is opened (see proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2)), and (2) would \nreform how and when cost disclosures must be made (see proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) for content, proposed \u00a7 226.5(b) \nand proposed \u00a7 226.9(c) for timing).\n\nProposed Comments 6(a)-1 and 6(a)-2\n\nFixed-rate and-term payment plans during draw period. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \n\u00a7 226.5b(c), HELOC plans typically offer the ability to obtain advances that must be repaid based on a variable \ninterest rate that applies to all outstanding balances. Some HELOC plans, however, also offer a fixed-rate and-term \npayment feature, where a consumer is permitted to repay all or part of the balance during the draw period at a fixed \nrate (rather than a variable rate) and over a specified time period. The Board understands that for most HELOC \nplans, consumers must take active steps to access the fixed-rate and-term payment feature; this feature is not \nautomatically accessed when a consumer obtains advances from the HELOC plan. Current \u00a7 226.6(a) requires a \ncreditor to disclose information related to fixed-rate and-term payment features. For example, a creditor would be \nrequired to disclose the rates applicable to the fixed-rate and-term feature under current \u00a7 226.6(a)(1), any fees that \nare finance charges under current \u00a7 226.6(a)(1), any fees that are other charges under current \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), and \npayment terms and other information required under current \u00a7 226.6(a)(3).\n\nUnder the proposal, the Board would continue to require that a creditor disclose information applicable to the fixed-\nrate and-term feature under proposed \u00a7 226.6. Generally, under the proposal, limited information about the fixed-\nrate and-term feature would be included in the account-opening table, and more detailed information would be \nincluded outside the table. Specifically, for the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c), if a HELOC plan offers a variable-rate feature and a fixed-rate and-term feature during the draw period, a \ncreditor generally must only disclose limited information in the account-opening table about the fixed-rate and-term \nfeature. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2). Instead of requiring that all the details of the fixed-rate and-term feature be \ndisclosed in the table, the Board proposes to require a creditor offering this payment feature (in addition to a \nvariable-rate feature) to disclose in the account-opening table the following: (1) A statement that the consumer has \n\n\n\nthe option during the draw period to borrow at a fixed interest rate; (2) the amount of the credit line that the \nconsumer may borrow at a fixed interest rate for a fixed term; and (3) a statement that information about the fixed-\nrate and-term payment plan is included in the account-opening disclosures or agreement, as applicable. See \nproposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xix). However, if a HELOC plan does not offer a variable-rate feature during the draw \nperiod, but only offers a fixed-rate and-term feature during that period, a creditor must disclose in the account-\nopening table information related to the fixed-rate and-term feature when making the disclosures required by \nproposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2). See proposed comment 6(a)-1.\n\nEven though a creditor generally may not disclose the terms of fixed-rate and-term payment plans in the account-\nopening table, the creditor must disclose additional information about these payment plans in disclosures required \nby proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5). For example, a creditor must disclose fees and rate information related \nto these features under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) and (a)(4), and information about payment terms and other terms \nrelated to these features under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v).\n\nDisclosures for the repayment period. Current comment 6(a)(3)-4 provides that a creditor must provide disclosures \nabout both the draw and repayment phases when giving the disclosures under \u00a7 226.6. To the extent the required \ndisclosures are the same for the draw and repayment phase, the creditor need not repeat such information, as long \nas it is clear that the information applies to both phases. The Board proposes to move current comment 6(a)(3)-4 to \nproposed comment 6(a)-2 and make technical revisions.\n\n6(a)(1) Format for Home-Equity Plan Account Disclosures\n\nAs provided by Regulation Z, creditors may, and typically do, include account-opening disclosures for HELOC plans \nas a part of an account agreement document that also contains other contract terms and state law disclosures. The \nagreement typically is in a narrative form, and is lengthy and in small print.\n\nThe Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) to impose format requirements for account-opening disclosures for \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, similar to proposed format requirements for the proposed early HELOC disclosures \ndiscussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2). The Board proposes this rule pursuant to \nits authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate \nthe statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers \navoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Specifically, under the proposal, a creditor \nwould be required to disclose to a consumer key terms relating to the HELOC plan in a tabular format at account \nopening. As discussed in more detail below, the proposed account-opening table would contain disclosures that are \nsimilar to the ones disclosed in the proposed early HELOC disclosures table required by proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b). A \ncreditor would be required to disclose certain identification disclosures, such as the borrower's name and address, \ndirectly above the account-opening table. In addition, a creditor would be required to disclose other information, \nsuch as a statement that the consumer should confirm that the terms disclosed in the table are the same terms for \nwhich the consumer applied, below the account-opening table. Under the proposal, not all disclosures that a \ncreditor would be required to provide to a consumer at account opening would be included in the account-opening \ntable (or directly above or below the table). For account-opening disclosures that are not specifically required to be \nin the account-opening table (or directly above or below the table), a creditor would be able to include these \ndisclosures as part of the account agreement.\n\nThe Board did not directly test whether providing account-opening disclosures in a narrative form as part of the \naccount agreement is an effective way to communicate those disclosures to consumers. Nonetheless, in the \nconsumer testing conducted by the Board on HELOC disclosures, the Board tested application disclosures in a \nnarrative form. Participants in consumer testing found this form difficult to read and understand, and their responses \nto follow-up questions showed that they also had difficulty identifying specific information in the text. Participants \nwho saw forms that were structured in a tabular format, on the other hand, commented that the information was \neasier to understand and had more success answering comprehension questions. These results regarding the \nbenefit of disclosing information in a tabular format are consistent with the results of research that the Board \nconducted on credit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule. (See \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a(a)(2), \n\n\n\n226.6(b)(1), 226.9(b)(3), 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(B) and 226.9(g)(3)(iii) for certain disclosures applicable to open-end (not \nhome-secured) credit that must be disclosed in a tabular format.) The Board also believes that providing key terms \nin a table at account opening, which would be similar to the proposed early HELOC disclosures table required by \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(b), would allow consumers to compare more easily the account-opening terms to those terms \nthat were disclosed earlier to the consumer. For these reasons, the Board proposes to require that certain account-\nopening disclosures must be provided in the form of a table with headings, content, and format substantially similar \nto any of the applicable tables found in proposed G-15 in Appendix G. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(1). Proposed \ncomment 6(a)(1)-3 clarifies that \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(i) generally requires that the headings, content and format of the \ntabular disclosures be substantially similar, but need not be identical, to the applicable tables in G-15 to Appendix \nG.\n\nComparison to early HELOC disclosures table. TILA Section 127(a)(8) provides that any disclosures required to be \ndisclosed as part of the early HELOC disclosures required under TILA Section 127A(a) also must be disclosed as \npart of the account-opening disclosures. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8). Thus, as discussed in more detail below, most of the \ndisclosures required to be disclosed in the proposed early HELOC disclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(b) also would be included in the account-opening table described in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2). \nNonetheless, while these two proposed tables would be similar, they would not be identical. For example, the table \ncontaining the early HELOC disclosures would show and compare two payment options offered on the HELOC \n(unless a creditor offers only one), while the account-opening disclosures would show only the payment plan \nchosen by the consumer. Proposed comment 6(a)-1 provides guidance on how the proposed early HELOC \ndisclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) differs from the proposed account-opening table in proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2). Proposed comment 6(a)(1)-1 specifically notes which rules in proposed \u00a7 226.5b applicable \nto the early HELOC disclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) would not apply to the proposed account-\nopening table.\n\nClear and conspicuous standard. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a), the Board \nproposes a clear and conspicuous standard applicable to \u00a7 226.6 disclosures. Proposed comment 6(a)(1)-2 \nprovides a cross reference to the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a) set forth in \nproposed comment 5(a)(1)-1.\n\nTerminology. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a), the Board proposes that \ncreditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b must use certain terminology when disclosing the draw period, any \nrepayment period, and certain other terms in the account-opening table. See proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(2). Proposed \ncomment 6(a)(1)-3 provides a cross reference to the terminology requirements set forth in proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(2).\n\n6(a)(2) Required Disclosures for Account-Opening Table for Home-Equity Plans\n\nFees. Current \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(3) and (a)(5), require a creditor to \ndisclose in the account-opening disclosures any finance charges or other charges imposed on the HELOC plan. 15 \nU.S.C. 1637(a)(3) and (a)(5). As discussed in more detail below, the Board proposed in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) that \ncertain fees must be disclosed in the account-opening table described in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2). Under \nthe proposal, creditors would have more flexibility regarding disclosure of other charges imposed as part of a \nHELOC plan. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) for content, proposed \u00a7 226.5(b) and proposed \u00a7 226.9(c) for timing.\n\nPursuant to TILA Section 127(a)(8) and for the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c), the Board proposes that a creditor must disclose in the account-opening table the following fees that also \nmust be disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b): (1) a total of the one-\ntime fees imposed by the creditor or third parties to open the HELOC plan and an itemization of those fees; (2) fees \nimposed by the creditor for the availability of the HELOC plan; (3) fees imposed by the creditor for early termination \nof the plan by the consumer; and (4) fees imposed for required insurance, debt cancellation or suspension \ncoverage. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(vii), (viii), (ix) and (xx). In addition, the Board proposes that the account-\nopening table also contain the following additional fees that are not required to be disclosed in the early HELOC \ndisclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b): (1) Late-payment fees; (2) over-the-limit fees; (3) transaction \n\n\n\ncharges; (4) returned-payment fees; and (5) fees for failure to comply with transaction limitations described under \nproposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xvii). See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(x), (xi), (xii), (xiii), and (xiv).\n\nThe Board intends that the proposed list of fees and categories of fees that would be included in the account-\nopening table be exclusive, for two reasons. The Board believes that only allowing an exclusive list of fees to be \ndisclosed in the account-opening table would benefit consumers. Based on consumer testing conducted by the \nBoard on HELOC disclosures, the Board believes the fees listed above to be the most important fees, at least in the \ncurrent marketplace, for consumers to know about before they start to use a HELOC account. Participants in this \ntesting who were shown an account-opening table which contained the fees listed above indicated that they found \nthis list sufficient, and could not identify any additional types of fees that they would want disclosed to them at \naccount opening.\n\nThe fees listed above include charges that a consumer could incur and which a creditor likely would not otherwise \nbe able to disclose in advance of the consumer engaging in the behavior that triggers the cost, such as fees \ntriggered by a consumer's use of a cash advance check or by a consumer's late payment. The proposed list is \nmanageable and focuses on key information rather than attempting to be comprehensive. Since consumers must \nbe informed of all fees imposed as part of the plan before the cost is incurred, the Board believes that not all fees \nneed to be included in the account-opening table provided at account opening.\n\nThe Board believes an exclusive list also would ease compliance and reduce the risk of litigation for creditors; \ncreditors would have the certainty of knowing that as new services (and associated fees) develop, fees not required \nto be disclosed in the summary table under the proposed rule need not be included in the account-opening \nsummary unless and until the Board requires their disclosure after notice and public comment. In addition, as \ndiscussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(1) and (b)(1), charges required to be included \nin the proposed account-opening table would be required to be provided in a written and retainable form before the \nfirst transaction, and a subsequent written notice is required if one of these fees increases or if these fees are newly \nintroduced during the life of the plan (but only as permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(f)). Under the proposal, creditors would \nhave more flexibility regarding disclosure of other charges imposed as part of a HELOC plan.\n\n6(a)(2)(i) Identification Information\n\nPursuant to TILA Section 127(a)(8) and for the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(1), the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(i) that a creditor must disclose above the account-opening \ntable the following identification information that also must be disclosed above the early HELOC disclosures table \ndescribed in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b): (1) The consumer's name and address; (2) the identity of the creditor making \nthe disclosures; (3) the date the disclosure was prepared; and (4) the loan originator's unique identifier, as defined \nby the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (\"SAFE Act\") Sections 1503(3) and (12). \n12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12); 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8). In addition, the Board proposes also that the creditor also \ndisclose the account number as part of the identification information that would be disclosed above the account-\nopening table. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments \nand exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating \nconsumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 \nU.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The Board believes that including the account number above the account-opening table \nmay allow a consumer in the future (after account opening) to connect better the account-opening table with the \naccount to which the disclosures apply.\n\n6(a)(2)(ii) Security Interest and Risk to Home\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(4), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(6), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of \nthe account-opening disclosures the fact that the creditor has or will acquire a security interest in the property \npurchased under the plan, or in other property identified by item or type. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(6). The Board proposes \nin new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(ii) to require that a creditor must disclose in the account-opening table a statement that the \n\n\n\ncreditor will acquire a security interest in the consumer's dwelling and that loss of the dwelling may occur in the \nevent of default. This same statement would be required to be disclosed as part of the proposed early HELOC \ndisclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b). See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(6).\n\n6(a)(2)(iii) Possible Actions by Creditor\n\nAs discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c), the Board proposes to require a creditor to \ndisclose in the early HELOC disclosures table a statement that, under certain conditions, the creditor may terminate \nthe plan and require payment of the outstanding balance in full in a single payment and impose fees upon \ntermination; prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limit; and implement changes in the plan. \nPursuant to TILA Section 127(a)(8), the Board also proposes in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(iii) to require a creditor to \ndisclose the above statement in the account-opening table. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8). In addition, under the proposal, a \ncreditor also would be required to disclose in the account-opening table a statement that information about the \ncircumstances under which the creditor may take these actions is provided in the account-opening disclosures or \nagreement, as applicable. Current \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(i) requires a creditor to disclose as part of the account-opening \ndisclosures the circumstances under which the creditor may take the above actions on the HELOC plan. The Board \nproposed to move current \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(i) to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(iv) and make technical revisions. Under the \nproposal, a creditor would be required to disclose the information about the circumstances under which the creditor \nmay take the above actions on the HELOC plan outside of the account-opening table under proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(5)(iv).\n\n6(a)(2)(iv) Tax Implications\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(v), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(8), requires that a creditor must disclose in the \naccount-opening disclosures a statement that the consumer should consult a tax adviser for further information \nregarding the deductibility of interest and charges. The Board proposed to move this provision in current \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3)(v) to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(iv). Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to include this \nstatement about consulting a tax adviser in the account-opening table.\n\nIn addition, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(8), in implementing Section \n1302 of the Bankruptcy Act, the Board proposes to require a creditor to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures \ntable a statement that the interest on the portion of the credit extension that is greater than the fair market value of \nthe dwelling may not be tax deductible for Federal income tax purposes. Pursuant to TILA Section 127(a)(8), the \nBoard also proposes that a creditor be required to disclose this statement in the account-opening table. 15 U.S.C. \n1637(a)(8).\n\n6(a)(2)(v) Payment Terms\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(8), requires a creditor to disclose as part of the \naccount-opening disclosures certain information related to payment terms on the HELOC plan that is currently \nrequired to be disclosed as part of the application disclosures, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis to \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8). For example, current \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii) requires a creditor to disclose \nin the account-opening disclosures the following information: (1) The length of the draw period and any repayment \nperiod; (2) an explanation of how the minimum periodic payment will be determined and the timing of the payments; \nand (3) if paying only the minimum periodic payments may not repay any of the principal or may repay less than the \noutstanding balance, a statement of this fact, as well as a statement that a balloon payment may result. In addition, \ncurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(vii) requires a creditor to disclose as part of the account-opening disclosures payment \nexamples that are currently required to be disclosed as part of the application disclosures, unless the application \ndisclosures were in a form the consumer could keep and included representative payment examples for the \ncategory of the payment option chosen by the consumer. The Board proposes to move these provisions in current \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3)(ii) and (a)(4)(iv) to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v) and make revisions.\n\n\n\nThe proposal. Consistent with TILA Section 127(a)(8), the Board proposes to require a creditor to disclose the same \ndisclosures relating to payment terms in the account-opening table that a creditor would be required to disclose in \nthe early HELOC disclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) (as discussed in the section-by-section \nanalysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)), with one exception. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8). The table containing the early \nHELOC disclosures would show and compare two payment options offered on the HELOC (unless a creditor offers \nonly one), while the account-opening disclosures would show only the payment plan chosen by the consumer. \nSpecifically, proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v) requires a creditor to disclose in the account-opening table certain payment \nterms of the plan that will apply to the consumer at account opening. Under the proposal, the creditor would be \nrequired to distinguish payment terms applicable to the draw period and the repayment period, by using the \napplicable heading \"Borrowing Period\" for the draw period and \"Repayment Period\" for the repayment period, in a \nformat substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables found in proposed Samples G-15(B) \nand G-15(D) in Appendix G.\n\nUnder the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table the length of the plan, the \nlength of the draw period and the length of any repayment period. When the length of the plan is definite, a creditor \nwould be required to disclose the length of the plan, the length of the draw period and the length of any repayment \nperiod in a format substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables found in proposed Samples \nG-15(B) and G-15(C) in Appendix G. If there is no repayment period on the plan, the creditor would be required to \ndisclose a statement that after the draw period ends, the consumer must repay the remaining balance in full. In \naddition, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table an explanation of \nhow the minimum periodic payment will be determined and the timing of the payments.\n\nAlso, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table payment examples \nbased on the assumptions that the consumer borrows the full credit line at account opening, and does not obtain \nany additional extensions of credit; the consumer makes only minimum periodic payments during the draw period \nand any repayment period; and the APRs (as described below) used to calculate the payment examples will remain \nthe same during the draw period and any repayment period. A creditor would be required to provide payment \nexamples for two APRs: (1) The current APR for the plan, except that if an introductory APR applies, the creditor \nwould be required to use the rate that would otherwise apply to the plan after the introductory rate expires, as \ndescribed in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(vi)(B); and (2) the maximum APR applicable to the payment plan described in \nthe table, as described in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(vi)(A)(1)(v). A creditor also would be required to disclose other \ninformation along with the payment examples, such as a statement that the sample payments are not the \nconsumer's actual payments. Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose the proposed payment \nexamples, and related information, in a format that is substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable \ntables found in proposed Samples G-15(B), G-15(C) and G-15(D) in Appendix G.\n\nMoreover, under the proposal, if under the payment plan disclosed in the account-opening table a consumer may \npay a balloon payment, a creditor would be required to disclose information about the balloon payment twice in the \naccount-opening table: at the beginning of the information about payment terms, and as part of the payment \nexamples. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v)(B) provides that if under the payment plan disclosed in the table, \npaying only the minimum periodic payments may not repay any of the principal or may repay less than the \noutstanding balance by the end of the HELOC plan, the creditor must disclose a statement of this fact in the \naccount-opening table, as well as a statement that a balloon payment may result. The \"Balloon Payment\" row in the \n\"Borrowing and Repayment Terms\" section of proposed Samples G-15(B) and G-15(C) in Appendix G provides \nguidance on how to comply with the requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v)(B).\n\nIn addition, regarding disclosure of the amount of the balloon payment in the proposed payment examples, \nproposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v)(C)(3)(iii) provides that if a consumer may pay a balloon payment under the payment plan \ndisclosed in the account-opening table, a creditor would be required to disclose that fact when disclosing the \nproposed payment examples, as well as disclose the amount of the balloon payment based on the assumptions \nused the calculate the payment examples as described in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v)(C). The first paragraph of the \n\"Sample Payments\" section of proposed Samples G-15(B) and G-15(C) in Appendix G provides guidance on how \nto comply with the requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v)(C)(3)(iii).\n\n\n\nUnder the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table a statement that the \nconsumer can borrow money during the draw period. In addition, if a repayment period is provided, a creditor would \nbe required to disclose in the account-opening table a statement that the consumer cannot borrow money during \nthe repayment period. Under the proposal, a creditor also would be required to disclose in the account-opening \ntable a statement indicating whether minimum payments are due in the draw period and any repayment period.\n\nChoosing payment plan at account opening. The Board understands that some creditors currently do not require \nconsumers to choose a payment plan until account opening. Under the proposal, even if a creditor does not require \na consumer to choose a payment plan until account opening, a creditor would still be required to disclose in the \naccount-opening table only the payment plan chosen by the consumer. Thus, a creditor that allows a consumer to \nchoose a payment plan at account opening would need to prepare account-opening tables for each payment plan \noffered on the HELOC plan from which a consumer may choose (except for fixed-rate and-term payment plans \nunless those are the only plans offered during the draw period) and take steps to ensure that the proper account-\nopening table is provided to the consumer depending on which payment plan is chosen by the consumer.\n\n6(a)(2)(vi) Annual Percentage Rate\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(1), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(1) and (a)(4), sets forth disclosure requirements for \nrates that would apply to HELOC accounts. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(1) and (a)(4). The Board proposes to require a \ncreditor to disclose in the account-opening table the same disclosures relating to APRs that a creditor would be \nrequired to disclose in the early HELOC disclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) (as discussed in the \nsection-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)). For example, under the proposal, a creditor would be \nrequired to disclose in the account-opening table each APR applicable to the payment plan disclosed in the table, \nexcept a creditor must not disclose any penalty rate set forth in the initial agreement that may be imposed in lieu of \ntermination of the plan. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(vi). Under the proposal, a creditor also would be required to \ndisclose certain information about any variable rates disclosed in the account-opening table, such as the fact that \nthe APR may change due to the variable-rate feature. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(vi)(A). In addition, under the \nproposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table any introductory rate that applies to \nthe payment plan disclosed in the table, as well as the time period during which the introductory rate will remain in \neffect and the rate that will apply after the introductory rate expires. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(vi)(B).\n\nUnder the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose other rate information under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) \nand (a)(4). For example, periodic rates would not be permitted to be disclosed in the account-opening table. \nNonetheless, under the proposal, the Board proposes to require creditors to disclose periodic rates, as a cost \nimposed as part of the plan, before the consumer agrees to pay or becomes obligated to pay for the charge, and \nthese disclosures could be provided in the credit agreement or other disclosure, as is likely currently the case.\n\n6(a)(2)(vii) Fees Imposed by the Creditor and Third Parties To Open the Plan\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2) require a creditor to disclose in the account-opening disclosures any finance \ncharges or other charges imposed on the HELOC plan. As discussed above, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2)(vii) to require that a creditor disclose in the account-opening table a total of the one-time fees imposed \nby the creditor or third parties to open the HELOC plan and an itemization of those fees. Under the proposal, the \ndisclosure of these fees in the account-opening table might differ from how these fees may have been disclosed in \nthe early HELOC disclosures table. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), \nwith respect to disclosing the itemization of the one-time account-opening fees in the proposed early HELOC \ndisclosures table, if the dollar amount of a fee is not known at the time the early HELOC disclosures are delivered \nor mailed, a creditor would be allowed to provide a range for such fee. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11). With respect \nto disclosure of the total of one-time account-opening fees in the proposed early HELOC disclosures table, if the \nexact total of one-time fees for account opening is not known at the time the early HELOC disclosures are delivered \nor mailed, a creditor would be required to disclose in the table as part of the early HELOC disclosures the highest \ntotal of one-time account opening fees possible for the plan with a indication that the one-time account opening \n\n\n\ncosts may be \"up to\" that amount. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11). Nonetheless, in the account-opening table, a \ncreditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table an itemization of all one-time fees imposed by \nthe creditor and third parties to open the plan, and may not disclose a range for those fees, as otherwise allowed \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) for the proposed early HELOC disclosures table. See proposed comment \n6(a)(2)(vii)-1. In addition, in the account-opening table, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-\nopening table the total of all one-time fees imposed by the creditor and third parties to open the plan, and may not \ndisclose the highest amount of possible fees as allowed under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) for the proposed early \nHELOC disclosures table. See proposed comment 6(a)(2)(vii)-1. At the time the creditor is disclosing the account-\nopening table, a creditor would know the exact amount of the one-time fees that will be imposed by the creditor and \nany third parties to open the HELOC account, and thus would be able to disclose the exact total of these one-time \nfees and an exact itemization of these fees.\n\nUnlike the proposed early HELOC disclosures table, in the account-opening table, the itemization of the one-time \nfees to open the account would not be disclosed with the total of these one-time fees but instead the itemization of \nthe fees would be disclosed on the second page of the table with penalty fees and transactions fees. Thus, under \nthe proposal, a creditor would be required to include in the account-opening table a cross reference near the \ndisclosure of the total of one-time fees for opening an account, indicating that the itemization of the fees is located \nelsewhere in the table.\n\n6(a)(2)(x) Late-Payment Fee\n\nAs discussed above, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table any \nfee imposed for a late payment. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(x) Proposed comment 6(a)(2)(x)-1 provides that the \ndisclosure of the fee for a late payment includes only those fees that will be imposed for actual, unanticipated late \npayments. This proposed comment cross references commentary to \u00a7 226.4(c)(2) for additional guidance on late-\npayment fees. In addition, this proposed comment notes that Samples G-15(B), G-15(C) and G-15(D) provide \nguidance to creditors on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the late-payment fee in the account-opening \ntable.\n\n6(a)(2)(xi) Over-the-Limit Fee\n\nAs discussed above, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table any \nfee imposed for exceeding a credit limit. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xi). Proposed comment 6(a)(2)(xi)-1 provides \nthat the disclosure of fees for exceeding a credit limit does not include fees for other types of default or for services \nrelated to exceeding the limit. For example, no disclosure would be required of fees for reinstating credit privileges \nor fees for the dishonor of checks on an account that, if paid, would cause the credit limit to be exceeded. In \naddition, this proposed comment notes that Samples G-15(B), G-15(C) and G-15(D) provide guidance to creditors \non how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the over-the-limit fee.\n\n6(a)(2)(xii) Transaction Charges\n\nAs discussed above, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table any \ntransaction charge imposed by the creditor for use of the HELOC plan. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xii). Proposed \ncomment 6(a)(2)(xii)-1 provides that charges imposed by a third party, such as a seller of goods, must not be \ndisclosed in the account-opening table. This proposed comment also notes that the third party would be responsible \nfor disclosing the charge under \u00a7 226.9(d)(1).\n\nIn addition, proposed comment 6(a)(2)(xii)-2 provides that a transaction charge imposed by the creditor for use of \nthe HELOC plan includes any fee imposed by the creditor for transactions in a foreign currency or that take place \noutside the United States or with a foreign merchant. This proposed comment cross references comment 4(a)-4 for \nguidance on when a foreign transaction fee is considered charged by the creditor. This proposed comment also \nnotes that Sample G-15(D) provide guidance to creditors on how to disclose a foreign transaction fee for use of a \n\n\n\ncredit card where the same foreign transaction fee applies for purchases and cash advances in a foreign currency, \nor that take place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant.\n\n6(a)(2)(xv) Statement About Other Fees\n\nAs discussed above, under the proposal, a creditor would not be required to disclose all the fees that apply to a \nHELOC plan in the account-opening table. Under the proposal, creditors would be provided with flexibility in \ndisclosing fees that would be required to be disclosed under the regulation but not in the account-opening table. As \ndiscussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5(a)(1) and (b)(1), under the proposal, \na creditor would be permitted to disclose charges that are not required to be disclosed in the account-opening table \neither before the first transaction or later, so long as they are disclosed before the cost is imposed. Despite this \nflexibility to disclose certain charges after account opening, the Board expects that creditors would continue to \ndisclose some of these charges in the account-opening disclosures or account agreement because of contract law \nor other reasons. Thus, the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xv) to require a creditor to disclose in the account-\nopening table a statement that information about other fees is included in the account-opening disclosures or \nagreement, as applicable. In addition, because certain fees disclosed in the account-opening table would be \ndisclosed on the first page of the table, and other fees disclosed in the table would be included on the second page \nof the table, the Board proposes to require a creditor to disclose in the account-opening table near the disclosure of \nfees on the first page of the table a statement that other fees are located elsewhere in the table.\n\n6(a)(2)(xvi) Negative Amortization\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(iii), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(8), provides that a creditor must disclose in the \naccount-opening disclosures a statement that negative amortization may occur as described in current \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(9). 15 U.S.C. 127(a)(8). The Board proposes to move current \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(iii) to proposed \n226.6(a)(2)(xvi) and make revisions. Specifically, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the \naccount-opening table, as applicable, a statement that negative amortization may occur and that negative \namortization increases the principal balance and reduces the consumer's equity in the dwelling. This same \ndisclosure would be required as part of the early HELOC disclosures table required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b). \nSee proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(15).\n\n6(a)(2)(xvii) Transaction Requirements\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(iv), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(8), provides that a creditor must disclose in the \naccount-opening disclosures a statement of any transaction requirements as described in current \u00a7 226.5b(d)(10). \nThe Board proposes to move current \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(iv) to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xvii) and make revisions. \nSpecifically, under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose in the account-opening table any \nlimitations on the number of extensions of credit and the amount of credit that may be obtained during any time \nperiod, as well as any minimum outstanding balance and minimum draw requirements. This same disclosure would \nbe required as part of the early HELOC disclosures table required under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b). See proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)16).\n\n6(a)(2)(xviii) Credit Limit\n\nCurrently, a creditor is not required to disclose in the account-opening disclosures the credit limit applicable to the \nHELOC plan. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(17), the Board proposes to \nrequire a creditor to disclose the credit limit applicable to the HELOC plan in the early HELOC disclosures table \nrequired under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b). Pursuant to TILA Section 127(a)(8) and for the reasons set forth in the \nsection-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(17), the Board proposes that this disclosure also be required in \nthe account-opening table. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8).\n\n\n\n6(a)(2)(xix) Statements About Fixed-Rate and-term Payment Plan\n\nAs discussed above, the Board proposes that if a HELOC plan offers a variable-rate feature and a fixed-rate and-\nterm feature during the draw period, a creditor generally would not be allowed to disclose in the account-opening \ntable all the terms applicable to the fixed-rate and-term feature. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2). Instead, the Board \nproposes to require a creditor offering this payment feature (in addition to a variable-rate feature) to disclose in the \naccount-opening table the following: (1) A statement that the consumer has the option during the draw period to \nborrow at a fixed interest rate; (2) the amount of the credit line that the consumer may borrow at a fixed interest rate \nfor a fixed term; and (3) a statement that information about the fixed-rate and-term payment plan is included in the \naccount-opening disclosures or agreement, as applicable. See proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xix). The Board proposes a \nsimilar disclosure in the proposed early HELOC disclosures table described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b). See proposed \n\u00a7 226.5b(c)(18).\n\n6(a)(2)(xx) Required Insurance, Debt Cancellation or Debt Suspension Coverage\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2) require a creditor to disclose in the account-opening disclosures any finance \ncharges or other charges imposed on the HELOC plan. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \n\u00a7 226.5b(c)(19), in the event that a creditor requires the insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage \n(to the extent permitted by state or other applicable law), the Board proposes to require a creditor to disclose in the \nearly HELOC disclosures table any fee for this coverage. See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(19). In addition, proposed \u00a7 \n226.5a(b)(19) require that a creditor also disclose in the early HELOC disclosures table a cross reference to where \nthe consumer may find more information about the insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage, if \nadditional information is included outside the early HELOC disclosures table. For the reasons set forth in the \nsection-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(19), the Board also proposes to require that a creditor make \nthese same disclosures in the account-opening table.\n\n6(a)(2)(xxi) Grace Period\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(i), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(1), provides that a creditor must disclose as part of \nthe account-opening disclosures a statement of when finance charges begin to accrue, including an explanation of \nwhether or not any time period exists within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance \ncharge. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(1). Under the proposal, the Board proposes to require that a creditor disclose below the \naccount-opening table the date by which or the period within which any credit extended may be repaid without \nincurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate and any conditions on the availability of the grace period. If \nno grace period is provided, a creditor would be required to disclose that fact below the account-opening table. If \nthe length of the grace period varies, the creditor would be allowed to disclose the range of days, the minimum \nnumber of days, or the average number of the days in the grace period, if the disclosure is identified as a range, \nminimum, or average. In disclosing a grace period that applies to all features on the account, under the proposal, a \ncreditor would be required to use the phrase \"How to Avoid Paying Interest\" as the heading for the information \nbelow the table describing the grace period. If a grace period is not offered on all features of the account, in \ndisclosing this fact below the table, a creditor would be required to use the phrase \"Paying Interest\" as the heading \nfor this information.\n\nProposed comment 6(a)(2)(xxi)-1 provides that a creditor that offers a grace period on all types of transactions for \nthe account and conditions the grace period on the consumer paying his or her outstanding balance in full by the \ndue date each billing cycle, or on the consumer paying the outstanding balance in full by the due date in the \nprevious and/or the current billing cycle(s) will be deemed to meet the requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xxi) \nby providing the following disclosure, as applicable: \"Your due date is [at least]  days after the close of each billing \ncycle. We will not charge you interest on your account if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month.\" \nProposed comment 6(a)(2)(xxi)-2 provides that a creditor may use the following language to describe below the \naccount-opening table that no grace period is offered, as applicable: \"We will begin charging interest on [applicable \ntransactions] on the date the transaction is posted to your account.\"\n\n\n\nThe Board understands that most creditors currently do not offer a grace period on any transactions on the HELOC \nplan. Thus, in most cases, creditors would include below the account-opening table a statement that the creditor will \nbegin charging interest on the transactions on the HELOC plan on the date the transaction is posted to the account. \nThe Board believes that requiring a creditor to disclose this statement below the account-opening table would be an \neffective way to inform a consumer that he or she cannot avoid paying interest on transactions on the HELOC plan.\n\n6(a)(2)(xxii) Balance Computation Method\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(iii), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(2), provides that creditors must explain as part of \nthe account-opening disclosures the method used to determine the balance to which rates are applied. 15 U.S.C. \n1637(a)(2). Under the proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose below the account-opening table the name \nof the balance computation method used by the creditor for each feature of the account, along with a statement that \nan explanation of the method(s) is provided in the account agreement or disclosure statement. See proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2)(xxii). To determine the name of the balance computation method to be disclosed, a creditor would be \nrequired to refer to \u00a7 226.5a(g) for a list of commonly-used methods; if the method used is not among those \nidentified, creditors would be required to provide a brief explanation in place of the name. In determining which \nbalance computation method to disclose, the creditor would be required to assume that credit extended will not be \nrepaid within any grace period, if any. The Board believes that the proposed approach of disclosing the name of the \nbalance computation method below the table, with a more detailed explanation of the method in the account-\nopening disclosures or account agreement, would provide an effective way to communicate information about the \nbalance computation method used on a HELOC plan to consumers, while not distracting from other information \nincluded in the account-opening table.\n\nProposed comment 6(a)(2)(xxii)-1 provides that in cases where the creditor uses a balance computation method \nthat is identified by name in the regulation, the creditor must disclose below the table only the name of the method. \nIn cases where the creditor uses a balance computation method that is not identified by name in the regulation, the \ndisclosure below the table must clearly explain the method in as much detail as set forth in the descriptions of \nbalance computation methods in \u00a7 226.5a(g). The explanation would not need to be as detailed as that required for \nthe disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(4)(i)(D), as discussed below. Proposed comment 6(a)(2)(xxii)-2 notes \nthat proposed Samples G-15(B), G-15(C) and G-15(D) would provide guidance to creditors on how to disclose the \nbalance computation method where the same method is used for all features on the account.\n\n6(a)(2)(xxiii) Billing Error Rights Reference\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.6(a)(6), which implements TILA Section 127(a)(7), provides that creditors offering HELOC accounts \nsubject to \u00a7 226.5b must provide notices of billing rights at account opening. This information is important, but \nlengthy. The Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xxiii) to draw consumers' attention to the notices by requiring a \ncreditor to disclose below the account-opening table a statement that information about billing rights and how to \nexercise them is provided in the account-opening disclosures or account agreement, as applicable. As discussed in \nthe section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5), under the proposal, a creditor would be required to \nprovide information about billing rights in the account-opening disclosures or account agreement, as applicable. \nSee proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(iii).\n\n6(a)(2)(xxiv) No Obligation Statement\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2), the Board proposes in \nnew \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2) to require a creditor to disclose below the early HELOC disclosures table a statement that the \nconsumer has no obligation to accept the terms disclosed in the table. In addition, under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2), if \na creditor provides space for the consumer to sign or initial the early HELOC disclosures, the creditor would be \nrequired to include a statement that a signature by the consumer only confirms receipt of the disclosure statement.\n\n\n\nPursuant to TILA Section 127(a)(8) and for the same reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis to \nproposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(2), the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xxiv) to require these same statements below \nthe account-opening table. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8). In addition, the Board also proposes to require a creditor to \ndisclose below the account-opening table a statement that the consumer should confirm that the terms disclosed in \nthe table are the same terms for which the consumer applied. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority \nin TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's \npurposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the \nuniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The Board believes this statement would be a helpful \nreminder to consumers to check that the terms disclosed in the account-opening table are the terms that the \nconsumer expects to apply to the HELOC plan based on the terms disclosed in the early HELOC disclosures table.\n\n6(a)(2)(xxv) Statement About Asking Questions\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(20), the Board proposes in \nnew \u00a7 226.5b(c)(20) to require a creditor to disclose below the early HELOC disclosures table a statement that if \nthe consumer does not understand any disclosure in the table the consumer should ask questions. Pursuant to \nTILA Section 127(a)(8) and for the same reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(20), the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xxv) to require that a creditor disclose this same statement \nbelow the account-opening table. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8).\n\n6(a)(2)(xxvi) Statement About Board's Web Site\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(c)(21), the Board proposes in \nnew \u00a7 226.5b(c)(21) to required a creditor to disclose below the early HELOC disclosures table a statement that the \nconsumer may obtain additional information at the Web site of the Federal Reserve Board, and a reference to that \nWeb site. Pursuant to TILA Section 127(a)(8), the Board proposes in new \u00a7 226.5b to require a creditor to provide \nthese same statements below the account-opening table. 15 U.S.C. 1637(a)(8). Although it is hard to predict how \nmany consumers might use the Board's Web site, and recognizing that not all consumers have access to the \nInternet, the Board believes that this Web site may be helpful to some consumers as they use their HELOC plan.\n\n6(a)(3) Disclosure of Charges Imposed as Part of Home-Equity Plans\n\nThe current rules for disclosing costs related to open-end plans create two categories of charges covered by TILA: \nfinance charges (former \u00a7 226.6(a)) and \"other charges\" (former \u00a7 226.6(b)). The terms \"finance charge\" and \"other \ncharge\" are given broad and flexible meanings in the current regulation and commentary. This ensures that TILA \nadapts to changing conditions, but it also creates uncertainty. The distinctions among finance charges, other \ncharges, and charges that do not fall into either category are not always clear. Examples of charges that are \nincluded or excluded charges are in the regulation and commentary, but they cannot provide definitive guidance in \nall cases. As creditors develop new kinds of services, some creditors find it difficult to determine whether associated \ncharges for the new services meet the standard for a \"finance charge\" or \"other charge\" or are not covered by TILA \nat all. This uncertainty can pose legal risks for creditors that act in good faith to classify fees.\n\nTo address this problem, the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule created a single category of \"charges imposed as \npart of open-end (not home-secured) plans,\" specified in \u00a7 226.6(b)(3). These charges include finance charges \nunder \u00a7 226.4(a) and (b), penalty charges, taxes, and charges for voluntary credit insurance, debt cancellation or \ndebt suspension coverage. In addition, charges to be disclosed include any charge the payment or nonpayment of \nwhich affects the consumer's access to the plan, duration of the plan, the amount of credit extended, the period for \nwhich credit is extended, or the timing or method of billing or payment. Charges imposed for terminating a plan are \nalso included.\n\nThree examples of types of charges that are not imposed as part of the plan are listed in \u00a7 226.6(b)(3)(iii). These \nexamples include charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the \n\n\n\nother institution's ATM; charges for a package of services that includes an open-end credit feature, if the charges \nwould be required whether or not the open-end credit feature were included and the non-credit services are not \nmerely incidental to the credit feature; and charges under \u00a7 226.4(e).\n\nThe Board proposes to apply the same approach to disclosure of charges under HELOC plans subject to \u00a7 226.5b, \nfor the same reasons as for open-end (not home-secured) plans. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) would set \nforth a single category of \"charges imposed as part of home-equity plans.\" The disclosures included, as specified in \nproposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(i) and (ii), would generally parallel those included for open-end (not home-secured) plans in \n\u00a7 226.6(b)(3)(i) and (ii). Similarly, proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(iii) would list types of charges not considered to be \ncharges imposed as part of a home-equity plan, generally paralleling \u00a7 226.6(b)(3)(iii), which specifies types of \ncharges not included as charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan.\n\nAs the Board acknowledged in the June 2007 Regulation Z Proposal and the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, this \nproposed approach does not completely eliminate ambiguity about what charges are subject to TILA disclosure \nrequirements. However, the proposed commentary provides examples to ease compliance. In addition, to further \nmitigate ambiguity, the proposed rule would provide a complete list in \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), as discussed above, of which \ncharges must be disclosed in tabular format in writing at account opening. Under the proposal, any charges covered \nby \u00a7 226.6(a)(3), but not identified in \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), would not be required to be disclosed in writing at account \nopening. However, if they are not disclosed in writing at account opening, a creditor would be required to disclose \nthese other charges imposed as part of a HELOC plan in writing or orally at a time and in a manner such that a \nconsumer would be likely to notice them before the consumer agrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge. \nThis proposed approach is intended in part to reduce creditor burden. For example, when a consumer orders a \nservice by telephone, creditors presumably disclose fees related to that service at that time for business reasons \nand to comply with other state and federal laws.\n\nMoreover, compared to the approach reflected in the current regulation, the Board believes that the broad \napplication of the statutory standard of fees \"imposed as part of the plan\" would make it easier for a creditor to \ndetermine whether a fee is a charge covered by TILA, and reduce litigation and liability risks. Proposed comment \n6(a)(3)(ii)-3 would be added to provide that if a creditor is unsure whether a particular charge is a cost imposed as \npart of the plan, the creditor may, at its option, consider such charges as a cost imposed as part of the plan for \nTruth in Lending purposes. In addition, this proposed approach will help ensure that consumers receive the \ninformation they need when it would be most helpful to them.\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii)(B), one of the categories of charges included in charges imposed as part of a \nhome-equity plan would be \"charges resulting from the consumer's failure to use the plan as agreed, except \namounts payable for collection activity after default; costs for protection of the creditor's interest in the collateral for \nthe plan due to default; attorney's fees whether or not automatically imposed; foreclosure costs; and post-judgment \ninterest rates imposed by law.\" This provision generally parallels \u00a7 226.6(b)(3)(ii)(B) applicable to open-end (not \nhome-secured) plans under the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, as well as longstanding comment 6(b)-2.ii. in the \ncurrent regulation. Two of the excepted charges, \"costs for protection of the creditor's interest in the collateral due \nto default\" and \"foreclosure costs,\" do not appear in \u00a7 226.6(b)(3)(ii)(B); \"foreclosure costs\" appears in current \ncomment 6(b)-2.ii. These types of charges could occur in HELOC accounts, and would most likely not occur in the \ncase of open-end (not home-secured) credit; they are similar to the other excepted types of charges in that all \nwould likely occur in the context of default or foreclosure. It would likely be impracticable for creditors to disclose, at \nthe time an account is opened, charges related to default or foreclosure, since the amount of such charges may not \nbe known at that time. Therefore, the Board believes it would be appropriate to include these two types of charges \nin the list of exceptions in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii)(B).\n\nProposed comment 6(a)(3)(ii)-2 would give examples of fees that affect the consumer's access to the plan (and \nthus are included as charges that must be disclosed since they are considered charges imposed as part of the \nplan). This proposed comment generally parallels comment 6(b)(3)(ii)-2 for open-end (not home-secured) credit; \nhowever, proposed comment 6(a)(3)(ii)-2 would refer to \"fees to obtain additional checks or credit cards\" and \"fees \nto expedite delivery of checks or credit cards,\" as examples of charges affecting access to the plan, rather than only \n\n\n\nreferring to fees to obtain or expedite delivery of credit cards, since HELOC plans are typically accessed by checks \nas well as, in some cases, credit cards.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(iii) would list types of charges not considered to be charges imposed as part of a home-\nequity plan. As in the case of open-end (not home-secured) credit under \u00a7 226.6(b)(3)(iii), these charges would \ninclude charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other \ninstitution's ATM; charges for a package of services that includes an open-end credit feature, if the charges would \nbe required whether or not the open-end credit feature were included and the non-credit services are not merely \nincidental to the credit feature; and charges under \u00a7 226.4(e) (generally, taxes and fees prescribed by law and \nrelated to security instruments). In proposed comment 6(a)(3)(iii)(B)-1, discussing charges for a package of services \nincluding an open-end credit feature, \"credit\" is substituted for \"a credit card,\" because HELOCs may not offer credit \ncard access.\n\nThe Board also proposes new comment 6(a)(3)-1, which would cross-reference comment 6(a)-1 for guidance on \ndisclosing information related to fixed-rate and-term payment options; there is no parallel comment under \u00a7 \n226.6(b)(3), because open-end (not home-secured) credit plans generally do not offer such options. Proposed \ncomments 6(a)(3)-2 and -3 discuss requirements for disclosing grace periods, and would generally parallel \ncomments 6(b)(3)-1 and -2, respectively, applying to open-end (not home-secured) credit as adopted in the January \n2009 Regulation Z Rule. Proposed comment 6(a)(3)-4 discusses circumstances where no finance charge is \nimposed when the outstanding balance is less than a certain amount, and would generally parallel comment \n6(b)(3)-3 as adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule.\n\n6(a)(4) Disclosure of Rates for Home-Equity Plans\n\nThe January 2009 Regulation Z Rule reorganizes and consolidates rules for disclosing interest rates in open-end \n(not home-secured) credit in \u00a7 226.6(b)(4). The Board proposes to follow the same approach for HELOCs; thus, \nrules for disclosing interest rates for HELOCs would appear in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(4). Proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(4) \nwould generally parallel \u00a7 226.6(b)(4). The proposed commentary to \u00a7 226.6(a)(4) also would generally parallel the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.6(b)(4), with adjustments in certain comments to address matters in which HELOCs differ \nfrom credit card accounts and other open-end (not home-secured) credit, as well as differences between the rules \napplicable to HELOCs and those applicable to open-end (not home-secured) credit (see, for example, proposed \ncomments 6(a)(4)(ii)-1, -2, and -3 and 6(a)(4)(iii)-1 and -2). In addition, the Board proposes new comment 6(a)(4)-1, \nwhich would cross-reference comment 6(a)-1 for guidance on disclosing information related to fixed-rate and-term \npayment options.\n\n6(a)(4)(i)(D) Balance Computation Method\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(4)(i)(D) would require creditors to explain the method used to determine the balance to which \nrates apply. In addition to disclosing the name of the balance computation method with the account-opening \nsummary table, as discussed under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) above, creditors would be required, as in the current regulation, to \nexplain the balance computation method in the account-opening agreement or other disclosure statement. Under \nthe proposal, a creditor would be required to disclose under the account-opening summary table a reference to \nwhere the explanation is found, along with the name of the balance computation method.\n\nModel clauses that explain commonly used balance computation methods, such as the average daily balance \nmethod, are in Model Clauses G-1 and G-1(A) in Appendix G. In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board \nadopted new Model Clause G-1(A) containing balance computation method model clauses for open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit, while retaining existing Model Clause G-1 to continue to provide the existing model clauses for \nHELOCs. The Board is now proposing to eliminate existing Model Clause G-1 and redesignate Model Clause G-\n1(A) as G-1; all creditors offering open-end credit would use the same model clauses for explanations of balance \ncomputation methods. See the discussion under Appendix G below.\n\n\n\n6(a)(4)(ii) Variable-Rate Accounts\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(4)(ii) would set forth the rules for variable-rate disclosures, parallel to \u00a7 226.6(b)(4)(ii) for \nopen-end (not home-secured) credit as adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule and contained in footnote \n12 to \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii) in the regulation currently in effect. Guidance on the accuracy of variable rates provided at \naccount opening would be moved from the commentary to the regulation and revised. Currently, comment \n6(a)(1)(ii)-3 provides that creditors in disclosing a variable-rate in the account-opening disclosures may provide the \ncurrent rate, a rate as of a specified date if the rate is updated from time to time, or an estimated rate under \u00a7 \n226.5(c). In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted an accuracy standard for variable rates \ndisclosed at account opening for open-end (not home-secured) credit; the rate disclosed was deemed accurate if it \nwas in effect as of a specified date within 30 days before the disclosures were provided. Creditors' option to provide \nan estimated rate as the rate in effect for a variable-rate account was eliminated. In adopting this accuracy \nstandard, the Board stated its belief that 30 days provides sufficient flexibility to creditors and reasonably current \ninformation to consumers. See \u00a7 226.6(b)(4)(ii)(G). The Board proposed a further technical clarification to the \naccuracy standard in the May 2009 Regulation Z Proposal. Proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(4)(ii)(G) provides that a variable \nrate on HELOC plans disclosed in the account-opening disclosures is accurate if it is a rate as of a specified date \nand this rate was in effect within the last 30 days before the disclosures are provided. This proposed accuracy \nstandard reflects the proposed technical clarification that the Board proposed to \u00a7 226.6(b)(4)(ii)(G) in May 2009.\n\n6(a)(5) Additional Disclosures for Home-Equity Plans\n\nSection 226.6(b)(5) of the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule contains rules for additional disclosures relating to open-\nend (not home-secured) credit, including: The disclosures required under \u00a7 226.4(d) that, if provided, entitle the \ncreditor to exclude voluntary credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension coverage from the finance charge \n(\u00a7 226.6(b)(5)(i)); the disclosure of security interests (\u00a7 226.6(b)(5)(ii)); and the statement about consumers' billing \nrights under TILA (\u00a7 226.6(b)(5)(iii)). Proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5) would set forth the parallel disclosures for HELOCs, in \n\u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(i), (ii), and (iii), respectively.\n\nProposed comment 6(a)(5)(i)-1 (similar to comment 6(b)(5)(i)-1 for open-end (not home-secured) credit) would \nprovide that creditors comply with \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(i) if they provide disclosures required to exclude the cost of \nvoluntary credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage from the finance charge in accordance \nwith \u00a7 226.4(d) before the consumer agrees to the purchase of the insurance or coverage. For example, if the \u00a7 \n226.4(d) disclosures are given at application, creditors need not repeat those disclosures at account opening.\n\nModel forms for the billing rights statement under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(iii) are in Appendices G-3 and G-3(A). In \nthe January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted new Appendix G-3(A) for open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit for improved readability, while retaining existing Appendix G-3 to give HELOC creditors the option of \nproviding the existing model billing rights statement form. The Board proposes to eliminate existing Appendix G-3 \nand redesignate Appendix G-3(A) as G-3; thus, all creditors offering open-end credit would use the same model \nform for the billing rights statement. See the discussion under Appendix G below.\n\nProposed commentary for \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(i), (ii), and (iii) would parallel the commentary to \u00a7 226.6(b)(5)(i), (ii), and \n(iii), respectively, with adjustments to address differences between HELOCs and open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit and between the rules applicable to each. For example, in proposed comment 6(a)(5)(ii)-2, a reference to \n\"your home\" (as the collateral for the credit) would be substituted for \"motor vehicle or household appliances.\" \nComments 6(b)(5)(ii)-4 and -5 for open-end (not home-secured) credit, do not appear relevant to HELOCs, and \ntherefore parallel comments under \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(ii) are not proposed and current comments 6(a)(4)-4 and -5, which \nstate these interpretations for HELOCs, would be deleted. Comment 6(b)(5)(ii)-4 (and comment 6(a)(4)-4) \naddresses the situation where collateral will be required only when the outstanding balance reaches a certain \namount; HELOCs generally require that the consumer's home secure the line of credit from the outset. Comment \n6(b)(5)(ii)-5 (and comment 6(a)(4)-5) discusses circumstances in which the collateral is owned by someone other \nthan the consumer liable for the credit extended; this would generally not be the case with HELOCs. However, the \n\n\n\nBoard requests comment on whether, and how often, the situations addressed by these two comments might occur \nin HELOC accounts, and accordingly whether these two comments should be retained for HELOCs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5) would contain two additional paragraphs without counterparts in \u00a7 226.6(b)(5). Section \n226.6(a)(5)(iv) would require a disclosure of the conditions under which the creditor in a HELOC may take certain \nactions, such as terminating the plan or changing its terms. The account-opening table required under proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2), as discussed above, would require a statement of the actions the creditor may take, such as \nterminating and accelerating a HELOC, reducing the credit limit, suspending further advances, or changing other \nterms, but would not require or permit setting forth the conditions under which the creditor is permitted, under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f), to take such actions. Instead, the account-opening table would have to contain a reference to the \ndisclosure or credit agreement in which the conditions would be disclosed. See also discussion under \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2)(iii), above.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v) would require disclosure of additional information about any fixed-rate and-term payment \noption offered under the HELOC plan. Under current Regulation Z, guidance on disclosing fixed-rate and-term \npayment options is contained only in the commentary (comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-2). To provide clearer guidance, the \nBoard proposes to state the rules about disclosure of such options in \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v).\n\nThe account-opening table required under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), as discussed above, would require a brief \nstatement about a fixed-rate and-term payment option, including a statement that the consumer has the option \nduring the draw period to borrow at a fixed interest rate, the amount of credit available under the option, and a \nstatement that details about this option are included in the credit agreement or other document, as applicable. See \nthe discussion under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xix), above. Proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v) would require that a creditor disclose at \naccount opening, but outside of the table prescribed in \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), the following additional information about the \noption: The period during which the option may be exercised (\u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v)(A)), the length of time over which \nrepayment can occur (\u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v)(B)), an explanation of how the minimum periodic payment for the option will \nbe determined (\u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v)(C)), and any limitations on the number or total amount of loans that can be \nobtained under the option, as well as any minimum outstanding balance or minimum draw requirements (\u00a7 \n226.6(a)(5)(v)(D)). Proposed comment 6(a)(5)(v)-1 would refer to proposed comment 6(a)-1 for further guidance on \ndisclosing information related to fixed-rate and-term payment options.\n\nSection 226.7 Periodic Statement\n\nTILA Section 127(b), implemented in \u00a7 226.7, identifies information about an open-end account that must be \ndisclosed when a creditor is required to provide periodic statements. See 15 U.S.C. 1637(b).\n\nPeriodic statement disclosure and format requirements for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b generally were unaffected \nby the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, consistent with the Board's plan to review Regulation Z's disclosure rules \nfor home-secured credit in a future rulemaking. To facilitate compliance, the Board in the January 2009 Regulation \nZ Rule grouped the requirements applicable to HELOCs together in \u00a7 226.7(a) (moved from former \u00a7 226.7(a) \nthrough (k)).\n\nThis proposal contains a number of significant revisions to periodic statement disclosures currently applicable to \ncreditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. Except as discussed below, these proposed revisions are \nsubstantially similar to revisions adopted for open-end (not home-secured) credit plans in the January 2009 \nRegulation Z Rule, and as proposed to be revised in the May 2009 Regulation Z Proposal. First, the Board \nproposes to eliminate the requirement to disclose the effective APR for HELOC accounts subject to \u00a7 226.5b. \nSecond, the proposal contains several formatting requirements for periodic statement disclosures for HELOC \naccounts subject to \u00a7 226.5b. For example, interest charges and fees imposed as part of the plan must be grouped \ntogether and totals disclosed for the statement period and year to date. In addition, if an advance notice of a \nchange in rates or terms is provided on or with a periodic statement, the proposal requires that a summary of the \n\n\n\nchange appear on the front of the periodic statement. To facilitate compliance, sample forms are proposed to \nillustrate the revisions. See proposed Samples G-24(A), C-24(B) and G-24(C) of Appendix G to part 226.\n\nEffective Annual Percentage Rate\n\nBackground on effective APR. TILA Section 127(b)(6) requires disclosure of an APR calculated as the quotient of \nthe total finance charge for the period to which the charge relates divided by the amount on which the finance \ncharge is based, multiplied by the number of periods in the year. See 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(6) (implemented by \u00a7 \n226.7(a)(7) for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b). This rate has come to be known as the \"historical APR\" or \"effective \nAPR.\" A creditor does not have to disclose an effective APR when the total finance charge is 50 cents or less for a \nmonthly or longer billing cycle, or the pro rata share of 50 cents for a shorter cycle. See 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(6). In \nsuch a case, the creditor must disclose only the periodic rate and the annualized rate that corresponds to the \nperiodic rate (the \"corresponding APR\"). See 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(5).\n\nThe effective APR and corresponding APR for any given plan feature are the same when the finance charge in a \nperiod arises only from applying the periodic rate to the applicable balance (the balance calculated according to the \ncreditor's chosen method, such as average daily balance method). When the two APRs are the same, Regulation Z \nrequires that the APR be stated just once. The effective and corresponding APRs diverge when the finance charge \nin a period arises (at least in part) from a charge not determined by application of a periodic rate and the total \nfinance charge exceeds 50 cents. When they diverge, Regulation Z currently requires that both be stated. See \u00a7 \n226.7(a)(4) and (a)(7).\n\nThe statutory requirement of an effective APR is intended to provide the consumer with an annual rate that reflects \nthe total finance charge, including both the finance charge due to application of a periodic rate (interest) and finance \ncharges that take the form of fees. This rate, like other APRs required by TILA, presumably was intended to provide \nconsumers information about the cost of credit that would help consumers compare credit costs and make informed \ncredit decisions and, more broadly, strengthen competition in the market for consumer credit. See 15 U.S.C. \n1601(a). There is, however, a longstanding controversy about whether the requirement to disclose an effective APR \nadvances TILA's purposes or, as some argue, actually undermines them.\n\nIndustry and consumer groups disagree as to whether the effective APR conveys meaningful information for open-\nend plans. Creditors argue that the cost of a transaction is rarely, if ever, as high as the effective APR makes it \nappear, and that this tendency of the rate to exaggerate the cost of credit makes this APR misleading. Industry \nrepresentatives also claim that the effective APR imposes direct costs on creditors that consumers pay indirectly. \nThey represent that the effective APR raises compliance costs when they introduce new services, including costs \nof: (1) Conducting legal analysis of Regulation Z to determine whether the fee for the new service is a finance \ncharge and must be included in the effective APR; (2) reprogramming software if the fee must be included; and (3) \nresponding to telephone inquiries from confused customers and accommodating them (e.g., with fee waivers or \nrebates).\n\nConsumer groups contend that the information the rate provides about the cost of credit, even if limited, is \nmeaningful. The effective APR for a specific transaction or set of transactions in a given cycle may provide the \nconsumer a rough indication that the cost of repeating such transactions is high in some sense or, at least, higher \nthan the corresponding APR alone conveys. Consumer advocates and industry representatives also disagree as to \nwhether the effective APR promotes credit shopping. Industry and consumer group representatives find some \ncommon ground in their observations that consumers do not understand the effective APR well.\n\nConsumer research on credit card disclosures conducted by the Board. In relation to the January 2009 Regulation \nZ Rule, the Board undertook research through a third-party consultant on consumer awareness and understanding \nof the effective APR, and on whether changes to the presentation of the disclosure could increase awareness and \nunderstanding. The consultant used one-on-one cognitive interviews with consumers; consumers were provided \nmock disclosures of periodic statements for credit card accounts that included effective APRs and asked questions \nabout the disclosure designed to elicit their understanding of the rate. The Board tested effective APR disclosures \n\n\n\nwith different versions of explanatory text in seven rounds of one-on-one interviews with consumers. In the first \nround the statements were copied from examples in disclosures currently used in the market. For subsequent \ntesting rounds, the language and design of the statements were modified to better convey how the effective APR \ndiffers from the corresponding APR. Several different approaches and many variations on those approaches were \ntested. For example, in later rounds of testing, the effective APR was labeled the \"Fee-Inclusive APR.\"\n\nIn all but one round of testing, a minority of participants correctly explained that the effective APR for cash \nadvances was higher than the corresponding APR for cash advances because the effective APR included a cash \nadvance fee that had been imposed. A smaller minority correctly explained that the effective APR for purchases \nwas the same as the corresponding APR for purchases because no transaction fee had been imposed on \npurchases. A majority offered incorrect explanations or did not offer any explanation. In addition, the inclusion of the \neffective APR disclosure on the statement was often confusing to participants; in each round some participants \nmistook the effective APR for the corresponding APR.\n\nIn addition, in September 2008 the Board conducted additional consumer research using quantitative methods for \nthe purpose of validating the qualitative research (one-on-one interviews) conducted previously. The quantitative \nconsumer research conducted by the Board validated the results of the qualitative testing; it shows that most \nconsumers do not understand the effective APR, and that for some consumers the effective APR is confusing and \ndetracts from the effectiveness of other disclosures. The quantitative consumer research involved surveys of \naround 1,000 consumers at shopping malls in seven locations around the country. Two research questions were \ninvestigated. The first was designed to determine what percentage of consumers understand the significance of the \neffective APR. The interviewer pointed out the effective APR disclosure for a month in which a cash advance \noccurred, triggering a transaction fee and thus making the effective APR higher than the corresponding APR \n(interest rate). The interviewer then asked what the effective APR would be in the next month, in which the cash \nadvance balance was not paid off but no new cash advances occurred. A very small percentage of respondents \ngave the correct answer (that the effective APR would be the same as the corresponding APR). Some consumers \nstated that the effective APR would be the same in the next month as in the current month, others indicated that \nthey did not know, and the remainder gave other incorrect answers.\n\nThe second research question was designed to determine whether the disclosure of the effective APR adversely \naffects consumers' ability to identify correctly the current corresponding APR on cash advances. Some consumers \nwere shown a periodic statement disclosing an effective APR, while other consumers were shown a statement \nwithout an effective APR disclosure. Consumers were then asked to identify the corresponding APR on cash \nadvances. A greater percentage of consumers who were shown a statement without an effective APR than of \nthose shown a statement with an effective APR correctly identified the corresponding APR on cash advances. This \nfinding was statistically significant, as discussed in the December 2008 Macro Report on Quantitative Testing. \nSome of the consumers who did not correctly identify the corresponding APR on cash advances instead mistakenly \nidentified the effective APR as that rate.\n\nProposal. After considering the results of the consumer testing and other factors mentioned in the background \ndiscussion of the effective APR, the Board is proposing that creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b no \nlonger be required to disclose the effective APR on periodic statements. (An identical exemption was adopted for \nopen-end (not home-secured) plans in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule.) The Board proposes this rule pursuant \nto its exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105. Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make \nexceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare \ncredit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Section \n105(f) authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions from coverage under any part of TILA if the Board \ndetermines that coverage under that part does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful \ninformation or protection. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). The Board must make this determination in light of specific \nfactors. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2). These factors are (1) the amount of the loan and whether the disclosure provides \na benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction involving a loan of such amount; (2) the extent to which \nthe requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more expensive the credit process; (3) the status of the borrower, \nincluding any related financial arrangements of the borrower, the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to \n\n\n\nthe type of transaction, and the importance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage \nunder TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the borrower; and (5) whether the \nexemption would undermine the goal of consumer protection.\n\nThe Board has considered each of these factors carefully, and based on that review, believes that the proposed \nexemption is appropriate. Consumer testing conducted on credit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 \nRegulation Z Rule shows that consumers find the current disclosure of an APR that combines rates and fees to be \nconfusing. Based on this consumer testing, the Board believes that consumers are likely confused by the effective \nAPR disclosure on HELOC accounts. Under this proposal, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b would be \nrequired to disclose interest and fees in a manner that is more readily understandable and comparable across \ninstitutions. The Board believes that this approach can more effectively further the goals of consumer protection and \nthe informed use of credit for all types of open-end credit.\n\nThe Board also considered whether there were potentially competing considerations that would suggest retention of \nthe requirement to disclose an effective APR. First, the Board considered the extent to which \"sticker shock\" from \nthe effective APR benefits consumers, even if the disclosure does not enable consumers to compare costs \nmeaningfully from month to month or for different products. A second consideration was whether the effective APR \nmay be a hedge against fee-intensive pricing by creditors, and if so, the extent to which it promotes transparency. \nOn balance, however, the Board believes that the benefits of eliminating the requirement to disclose the effective \nAPR outweigh these considerations.\n\nThe consumer testing conducted for the Board supports this determination. Again, with the exception of one round \nof one-on-one testing, the overall results of the testing demonstrated that most consumers do not correctly \nunderstand the effective APR. Some consumers in the testing offered no explanation of the difference between the \ncorresponding and effective APR, and others appeared to have an incorrect understanding.\n\nEven if some consumers have some understanding of the effective APR, the Board believes that sound reasons \nsupport eliminating the requirement to disclose it. Disclosure of the effective APR on periodic statements does not \nsignificantly assist consumers in credit shopping, because the effective APR disclosed on a periodic statement for a \nHELOC account cannot be compared to the corresponding APR disclosed in early disclosures given pursuant to \u00a7 \n226.5b. In addition, even within the same account, the effective APR for a given cycle is unlikely to indicate \naccurately the cost of credit in a future cycle, because if any of several factors (such as the timing of transactions \nand payments and the amount carried over from the prior cycle) is different in the future cycle, the effective APR will \nbe different even if the amounts of the transaction and the fee are the same in both cycles.\n\nAs to contentions that the effective APR for a particular billing cycle provides the consumer a rough indication that \nthe cost of repeating transactions triggering transaction fees is high in some sense, the Board believes the \nproposed requirements to disclose interest and fee totals for the cycle and year to date will better serve that \npurpose. In addition, the proposed interest and fee total disclosure requirements would ensure that creditors must \nclearly disclose all costs; this should address concerns that eliminating the effective APR would remove \ndisincentives for creditors to adopt fee-intensive pricing on HELOC accounts.\n\n7(a) Rules Affecting Home-Equity Plans\n\nIn the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board provided in \u00a7 226.7(a) that at their option, creditors offering \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b may comply with the periodic statement requirements of \u00a7 226.7(b) applicable to \ncreditors offering open-end (not home-secured) credit, instead of the requirements in \u00a7 226.7(a). The Board \nprovided this flexibility because some creditors may use a single processing system to generate periodic \nstatements for all open-end products they offer, including HELOCs. These creditors would have the option to \ngenerate statements according to a single set of rules, until the Board completed its review of Regulation Z's \ndisclosure rules for home-secured credit. In this proposal, the Board proposes to remove the option for creditors \noffering HELOCs to comply with the periodic statement requirements of \u00a7 226.7(b) applicable to creditors offering \nopen-end (not home-secured) credit. Instead, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b would have to comply \n\n\n\nwith the requirements in \u00a7 226.7(a). Nonetheless, the proposed periodic statement requirements in \u00a7 226.7(a) \napplicable to HELOC creditors are substantially similar to the requirements in \u00a7 226.7(b) applicable to open-end \n(not home-secured) plans, except for provisions related to the itemization of interest charges in \u00a7 226.7(a)(6), and \ncertain late-payment disclosures, minimum payment disclosures and formatting requirements related to those \ndisclosures, as discussed in more detail below. The Board requests comment on whether creditors that currently \nuse a single processing system to generate periodic statements for all open-end products they offer would be able \nto continue to do so under the proposal.\n\n7(a)(1) Previous Balance\n\nSection 226.7(a)(1), which implements TILA Section 127(b)(1), requires a creditor offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b to disclose on the periodic statement the account balance outstanding at the beginning of the billing cycle. \n15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(1). The Board proposes no changes to these disclosure requirements.\n\n7(a)(2) Identification of Transactions\n\nSection 226.7(a)(2), which implements TILA Section 127(b)(2), requires creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b to identify on the periodic statement transactions according to the rules in \u00a7 226.8. 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(2). \nSome HELOC plans involve different features, such as a variable-rate feature and optional fixed-rate features. \nComment 7(a)(2)-1 currently provides that in identifying transactions under \u00a7 226.7(a)(2) for multifeatured plans, \ncreditors may, for example, choose to arrange transactions by feature or in some other clear manner, such as by \narranging the transactions in chronological order. The Board proposes technical revisions to this comment, without \nsubstantive change, to conform this comment to a similar comment applicable to open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit plans. See comment 7(b)(2)-1. Specifically, the Board proposes to revise comment 7(a)(2)-1 to specify that \ncreditors may, but are not required to, arrange transactions by feature. Thus, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b would still be permitted to list transactions chronologically or organize transactions in any other way that \nwould be clear to consumers. The Board also proposes to revise this comment to clarify, consistent with proposed \u00a7 \n226.7(a)(6), that all fees and interest must be grouped together under separate headings and may not be \ninterspersed with transactions.\n\n7(a)(3) Credits\n\nSection 226.7(a)(3), which implements TILA Section 127(b)(3), requires creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b to disclose any credits to the account during the billing cycle. 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(3). Creditors typically \ndisclose credits among other transactions. The Board proposes to revise comment 7(a)(3)-1 to clarify that credits \nmay be distinguished from transactions in any way that is clear and conspicuous; for example, by use of debit and \ncredit columns or by use of plus signs for credits and minus signs for debits.\n\n7(a)(4) Periodic Rates\n\nRates that \"may be used.\" TILA Section 127(b)(5) requires creditors to disclose all periodic rates that may be used \nto compute the finance charge, and the APR that corresponds to the periodic rate multiplied by the number of \nperiods in a year. See 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(5); \u00a7 226.14(b). Prior to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, former \ncomment 7(d)-1 interpreted the requirement to disclose all periodic rates that \"may be used\" to mean \"whether or \nnot [the rate] is applied during the billing cycle.\" In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted for \nHELOCs a limited exception to TILA Section 127(b)(5) regarding promotional rates that were offered but not \nactually applied, to effectuate the purposes of TILA to require disclosures that are meaningful and to facilitate \ncompliance. Specifically, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b are required to disclose a promotional rate \nonly if the rate actually applied during the billing period. See \u00a7 226.7(a)(4)(ii) and comment 7(a)(4)-1. The Board \nnoted that interpreting TILA to require the disclosure of all promotional rates would be operationally burdensome for \ncreditors and result in information overload for consumers. This proposal retains the exception in \u00a7 226.7(a)(4)(ii).\n\n\n\nPeriodic rates. In this proposal, the Board proposes to eliminate the requirement to disclose periodic rates on \nperiodic statements for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. See proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) and accompanying commentary. \nUnder the proposal, creditors would still be required to disclose an APR that corresponds to each periodic rate that \nmay be used to compute the finance charge. For example, assume a monthly periodic rate of 1.5 percent applies to \ntransactions on a HELOC account. The corresponding APR to this periodic rate would be 18 percent. Under the \nproposal, creditors would be required to disclose the 18 percent corresponding APR, but would not be required to \ndisclose the 1.5 percent periodic rate.\n\nThe Board proposes to eliminate the requirement to disclose periodic rates on periodic statements, pursuant to the \nBoard's exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105. Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make \nexceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare \ncredit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Section \n105(f) authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions from coverage under any part of TILA if the Board \ndetermines that coverage under that part does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful \ninformation or protection. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). The Board must make this determination in light of specific \nfactors. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2). These factors are (1) the amount of the loan and whether the disclosure provides \na benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction involving a loan of such amount; (2) the extent to which \nthe requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more expensive the credit process; (3) the status of the borrower, \nincluding any related financial arrangements of the borrower, the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to \nthe type of transaction, and the importance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage \nunder TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the borrower; and (5) whether the \nexemption would undermine the goal of consumer protection.\n\nFor this proposal, the Board considered each of these factors carefully, and based on that review, determined that \nthe proposed exemption is appropriate. In consumer testing conducted for the Board on credit card disclosures in \nrelation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, consumers indicated they do not use periodic rates to verify interest \ncharges. Based on this consumer testing, the Board believes consumers are not likely to use periodic rates to verify \ninterest charges for HELOC accounts. Requiring periodic rates to be disclosed on periodic statements may detract \nfrom more important information on the statement, and contribute to information overload. Thus, eliminating periodic \nrates from the periodic statement has the potential to further the goals of consumer protection and the informed use \nof credit for HELOCs more effectively than if they are included. The Board notes that under the proposal, creditors \nmay continue to disclose the periodic rate, as long as the additional information is presented in a way that is \nconsistent with creditors' duty to provide required disclosures clearly and conspicuously. See proposed comment \napp. G-15.\n\nLabeling APRs. Currently creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b are provided with considerable flexibility in \nidentifying the APR that corresponds to the periodic rate. Comment 7(a)(4)-4 permits labels such as \"corresponding \nannual percentage rate,\" \"nominal annual percentage rate,\" or \"corresponding nominal annual percentage rate.\" \nThis proposal would amend \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) to require creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b to label the APR \ndisclosed under \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) as the \"annual percentage rate.\" Comment 7(a)(4)-4 would be deleted. The proposal \nis intended to promote uniformity in how the \"interest only\" APR is described in HELOC disclosures. Under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.5b and 226.6, creditors must use the term \"annual percentage rate\" to describe the \"interest only\" APR(s) that \nmust be disclosed in the tabular disclosures described in proposed \u00a7 226.5b(b) provided to a consumer within three \nbusiness days after the consumer submits an application (but no later than account opening) and in the tabular \ndisclosures described in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) provided at account opening. See proposed Model Forms G-14(A) \nand G-15(A).\n\nCombining interest and other charges. Currently, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b must disclose \nfinance charges attributable to periodic rates. These costs are typically interest charges but may include other costs \nsuch as premiums for required credit insurance. If applied to the same balance, creditors may disclose each rate, or \na combined rate. See comment 7(a)(4)-3. As discussed below, consumer testing for the Board conducted on credit \ncard disclosures in relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule indicated that participants appeared to \nunderstand credit costs in terms of \"interest\" and \"fees.\" Because consumers tend to associate periodic rates with \n\n\n\n\"interest,\" it seems unhelpful to consumers' understanding to permit creditors to include periodic rate charges other \nthan interest in the dollar cost disclosed for \"interest.\" Thus, the Board proposes to require creditors offering \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b that impose finance charges attributable to periodic rates (other than interest) to \ndisclose the amount of those charges in dollars as a \"fee.\" See section-by-section analysis to \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) below. \nThis proposal would delete current guidance in comment 7(a)(4)-3, which permits periodic rates attributable to \ninterest and other finance charges to be combined.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to add new comment 7(a)(4)-4 to provide guidance to creditors when a fee is \nimposed, remains unpaid, and interest accrues on the unpaid balance. The proposed comment provides that \ncreditors disclosing fees in accordance with the format requirements of \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) need not separately disclose \nwhich periodic rate applies to the unpaid fee balance. For example, assume a fee is imposed for a late payment in \nthe previous cycle and that the fee, unpaid, would be included in the purchases balance and accrue interest at the \nrate for purchases. The creditor need not separately disclose that the purchase rate applies to the portion of the \npurchases balance attributable to the unpaid fee.\n\n7(a)(5) Balance on Which Finance Charge Is Computed\n\nSection 226.7(a)(5), which implements TILA Section 127(b)(7), currently requires creditors offering HELOCs subject \nto \u00a7 226.5b to disclose the amount of the balance to which a periodic rate was applied and an explanation of how \nthe balance was determined. 15 U.S.C. 127(b)(7) The Board provides model clauses that creditors may use to \nexplain common balance computation methods. See Model Clauses G-1. The staff commentary to \u00a7 226.7(a)(5) \ninterprets how creditors may comply with TILA in disclosing the \"balance,\" which typically changes in amount \nthroughout the cycle, on periodic statements.\n\nExplanation of how finance charges may be verified. In disclosing the amount of the balance to which a periodic \nrate was applied, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b that use a daily balance method are permitted to \ndisclose an average daily balance for the period, so long as they explain that the amount of the finance charge can \nbe verified by multiplying the average daily balance by the number of days in the statement period, and then \napplying the periodic rate. See comment 7(a)(5)-4. The Board proposes to revise comment 7(a)(5)-4 to permit \ncreditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, at their option, not to include an explanation of how the finance \ncharge may be verified for creditors that use a daily balance method. As a result, the Board proposes to retain the \nrule permitting creditors to disclose an average daily balance but eliminate the requirement to provide the \nexplanation. Consumer testing conducted for the Board on credit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 \nRegulation Z Rule suggested that the explanation may not be used by consumers as an aid to calculate their \ninterest charges. Participants suggested that if they had questions about how the balances were calculated or \nwanted to verify interest charges based on information on the periodic statement, they would call the creditor for \nassistance. Based on this consumer testing, the Board believes that the explanation may not be useful to \nconsumers with HELOC accounts.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to require creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b to refer to the balance as \n\"balances subject to interest rate,\" to complement proposed revisions intended to further consumer understanding \nof interest charges, as distinguished from fees. See section-by-section analysis to \u00a7 226.7(b)(6). Proposed Samples \nG-24(B) and G-24(C) illustrate this format requirement.\n\nExplanation of balance computation method. As discussed above, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b \ncurrently must disclose the amount of the balance to which a periodic rate was applied and an explanation of how \nthe balance was determined This proposal contains an alternative to providing an explanation of how the balance \nwas determined. Under proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(5), a creditor that uses a balance computation method identified in \u00a7 \n226.5a(g) would have two options. The creditor could: (1) Provide an explanation, as the rule currently requires, or \n(2) identify the name of the balance computation method and provide a toll-free telephone number where \nconsumers may obtain more information from the creditor about how the balance is computed and resulting interest \ncharges are determined. If the creditor uses a balance computation method that is not identified in \u00a7 226.5a(g), the \ncreditor would be required to provide a brief explanation of the method. Under the proposal, comment 7(a)(5)-6, \n\n\n\nwhich refers creditors to guidance in comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-1 about disclosing balance computation methods, would \nbe deleted as unnecessary. The Board's proposal is guided by the following factors.\n\nCalculating balances on open-end plans can be complex, and requires an understanding of how creditors allocate \npayments, assess fees, and record transactions as they occur during the cycle. Currently, neither TILA nor \nRegulation Z requires creditors to disclose on periodic statements all the information necessary to compute a \nbalance, and requiring that level of detail appears unwarranted. Although the Board's model clauses are intended to \nassist creditors in explaining common balance computation methods, consumers continue to find these \nexplanations lengthy and complex. As stated earlier, consumer testing conducted on credit card disclosures in \nrelation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule indicates that consumers call the creditor for assistance when they \nhave questions on how to calculate balances and verify interest charges.\n\n7(a)(6) Charges Imposed\n\nSection 227.7(a)(6)(i), which implements TILA Section 127(b)(4), requires creditors offering HELOC subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b to disclose on the periodic statement the amount of any finance charge added to the account during the \nperiod, itemized to show amounts due to the application of periodic rates and the amount imposed as a fixed or \nminimum charge. 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(4). In addition, \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(ii) requires these creditors to disclose on the \nperiodic statement the amount, itemized and identified by type, of any \"other charges\" debited to the account during \nthe billing cycle. Some charges do not fall with the \"finance charge\" and \"other charges\" categories and thus are not \nrequired to be disclosed on the periodic statement even if they are imposed in a particular billing cycle. See current \ncomment 6(a)(2)-2.\n\nAs discussed in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3), the Board proposes to create a single \ncategory of charges, namely \"charges imposed as part of home-equity plans.\" Consistent with proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3), proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) requires creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b to disclose on the \nperiodic statement the amount of any charge imposed as part of a HELOC plan, as stated in proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3), for the statement period. Charges imposed as part of a HELOC plan consist of two types of charges--\ninterest and fees. Proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(ii) establishes periodic statement disclosure requirements for interest \ncharges. If different periodic rates apply to different types of transactions, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b would be required to itemize interest charges for the statement period by type of transaction or group of \ntransactions subject to different periodic rates. The Board proposes that these itemized interest charges must be \ngrouped together. In addition, the Board proposes to require a creditor to disclose a total of interest charges \ndisclosed for the statement period and calendar year. See proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(ii). Proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(iii) \nestablishes periodic statement disclosure requirements for fees. The Board proposes that fee imposed during the \nstatement period must be itemized and grouped together, and a total of fees disclosed for the statement period and \ncalendar year to date. See proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(iii). In addition, the Board proposes that these disclosures \nregarding interest and fees must be grouped together in proximity to the transactions identified under \u00a7 226.7(a)(2), \nin a manner substantially similar to Sample G-24(A) in Appendix G to part 226. See proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(i).\n\nCharges imposed as part of the plan. As discussed above, under the proposal, creditors would be required to \ndisclose on the periodic statement the amount of any charges imposed as part of a HELOC plan, as stated in \nproposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3), for the statement period. Guidance on which charges would be deemed to be imposed as \npart of the plan is in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii) and accompanying commentary. As discussed in the section-by-\nsection analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3), coverage of charges is broader under the proposed standard of \n\"charges imposed as part of the plan\" than under current standards for finance charges and other charges. While \nthe Board understands that some creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b have been disclosing on the \nstatement all charges debited to the account regardless of whether they are now defined as \"finance charges,\" \n\"other charges,\" or charges that do not fall into either category, other creditors currently do not disclose on periodic \nstatements the charges that fall outside the current \"finance charge\" and \"other charge\" categories. Nonetheless, \nthe Board believes that requiring creditors to disclose on the periodic statement all charges imposed as part of the \n\n\n\nHELOC plan that are charged during a particular billing cycle would help ensure that consumers are informed of \nthese charges\n\nLabeling costs imposed as part of the plan as interest or fees. For creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, \nthe Board proposes to delete the requirement in \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) to label finance charges as such. Consumer testing \nconducted for the Board on credit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule indicated that \nmost participants reviewing mock credit card periodic statements could not correctly explain the term \"finance \ncharge.\" Consumers generally understand interest as the cost of borrowing money over time and view other costs--\nregardless of their characterization under TILA and Regulation Z--as fees. Based on this consumer testing, the \nBoard proposes to amend \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) to label costs as either \"interest charge\" or \"fees\" rather than \"finance \ncharge\" to align more closely with consumers' understanding.\n\nInterest charges. TILA Section 127(b)(4) requires creditors to disclose on periodic statements the amount of any \nfinance charge added to the account during the period, itemized to show amounts due to the application of periodic \nrates and the amount imposed as a fixed or minimum charge. See 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(4). This current requirement \nwith respect to creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b is implemented in \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(i), which gives \nconsiderable flexibility regarding totaling or subtotaling finance charges attributable to periodic rates and other fees. \nSee current \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(i) and comments 7(a)(6)(i)-1, -2, -3, and -4. As discussed in more detail below, the Board \nproposes to amend \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) to require creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b to disclose total interest \ncharges, for the statement period and year to date, labeled as such. In addition, if different periodic rates apply to \ndifferent types of transactions, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b would be required to itemize finance \ncharges attributable to interest by type of transaction, or group of transactions subject to different periodic interest \nrates, labeled as such. Creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, at their option, would be allowed to itemize \ninterest charges by transaction type, even if the same periodic interest rates apply to those transactions. A creditor \nwould be required to group all itemized interest charges on an account together, regardless of whether the interest \ncharges are attributable to different authorized users or subaccounts. See proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(ii). Under this \nproposal, finance charges attributable to periodic rates other than interest charges, such as required credit \ninsurance premiums, would be required to be identified as fees and would not be permitted to be combined with \ninterest costs. See proposed comments 7(a)(4)-3 and 7(a)(6)-3.\n\nThe Board understands that for most HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, the same variable rate on the account applies to \nmost transactions on the account, regardless of the type of transactions (e.g., purchases or cash advances) and \nregardless of whether these transactions are initiated by check, wire transfer or by a credit card device linked to the \nHELOC. In some cases, creditors may offer optional features on the HELOC at different periodic interest rates from \nthe generally applicable variable rate feature, such as fixed-rate features. Under the proposal, in this example, \ncreditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b would be required to itemize the interest charges applicable to the \ngeneral variable-rate feature separate from the interest charges applicable to other features (such as fixed rate \noptional features) that are subject to different periodic interest rates. Proposed Sample G-24(A) in Appendix G to \npart 226 illustrates the proposal.\n\nAlthough creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b are not currently required to itemize interest charges, these \ncreditors often do so. For example, creditors may separately disclose the dollar interest costs associated with \nadvances under the general variable-rate feature and advances under fixed-rate optional features. The Board \nbelieves that the breakdown of interest charges by features subject to different periodic interest rates enables \nconsumers to better understand the cost of using each feature.\n\nThis proposal regarding itemization of interest charges differs from the provision for itemization of interest charges \napplicable to open-end (not home-secured) credit plans that the Board adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z \nRule. Specifically, creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) credit plans must itemize interest charges by \ntransaction type, regardless of whether the same rate applies to the types of transactions. Unlike for open-end (not \nhome-secured) credit, the Board is not proposing for HELOC accounts to require an itemization of interest charges \nby transaction type in all cases, even if the same rates apply to those types of transactions (although creditors are \npermitted to do so). The distinction between types of transactions (such as purchases and cash advances) is \n\n\n\ngenerally more important for open-end (not home-secured) credit plans--particularly unsecured credit card \naccounts--than for HELOCs. For unsecured credit card accounts, different rates, fees and other account terms \ntypically apply to purchases and cash advances. The Board believes that requiring a breakdown of interest charges \nby transactions type in all cases for unsecured credit cards, even if a particular unsecured credit card does not \napply different rates to purchases and cash advances, provides for uniformity in periodic statements and allows \nconsumers to compare more easily one unsecured credit card account with other unsecured credit card accounts \nthe consumer may have. As discussed above, most HELOC accounts do not charge different rates on purchases \nand cash advances.\n\nFees. For HELOC accounts, existing \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(ii) requires the disclosure of \"other charges\" parallel to the \nrequirement in TILA Section 127(a)(5) and \u00a7 226.6(b) to disclose such charges at account opening. See 15 U.S.C. \n1637(a)(5). Consistent with current rules to disclose \"other charges,\" proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(iii) requires that \ncharges other than interest be identified consistent with the feature (e.g., cash advances or fixed-rate transactions) \nor type (e.g., late-payment or over-the-limit), and itemized. The proposal differs from current requirements in the \nfollowing respect: Fees would be required to be grouped together and a total of all fees for the statement period and \nyear to date would be required, as discussed in more detail below.\n\nIn consumer testing conducted on credit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the \nBoard tested in the fall of 2008 consumers' ability to identify fees (1) on periodic statements where fees were \ngrouped together and (2) on periodic statements where fees were interspersed with transactions, and the fees and \ntransactions were listed in chronological order. Testing evidence showed that the periodic statement with grouped \nfees performed better among participants with respect to identifying fees.\n\nConsumers' ability to match a transaction fee to the transaction giving rise to the fee was also tested. Among \nparticipants who correctly identified the transaction to which they were asked to find the corresponding fee, a larger \npercentage of consumers who saw a statement on which account activity was arranged chronologically were able \nto match the fee to the transaction than when the fees were grouped together; however, out of the participants who \nwere able to identify the transaction to which they were asked to find the corresponding fee, the percentage of \nparticipants able to find the corresponding fee was very high for both types of listings.\n\nThe Board believes that the ability to identify all fees is important for consumers to assess their cost of credit. As \ndiscussed above, the Board would expect that the vast majority of consumers with HELOC accounts would not \ncomprehend the effective APR; thus, the Board believes that highlighting fees and interest for consumers would \nmore effectively inform consumers of their costs of credit on HELOC accounts. As also discussed above, the results \nof consumer testing on credit card disclosures indicated that grouping fees together on periodic statements for \nunsecured credit cards helped consumers find fees more easily. Based on this consumer testing, the Board \nproposes under \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(iii) to require creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b to group fees together. \nThe Board proposes this rule pursuant to its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments and exceptions \nto the requirements in TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to \ncompare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). \nUnder the proposal, a creditor would be required to group all fees assessed on the account during the billing cycle \ntogether under one heading even if fees may be attributable to different users of the account or to different sub-\naccounts.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on this aspect of the proposal. Specifically, the Board solicits comment on whether \ngrouping fees together (and not allowing them to be interspersed with transactions) is necessary to help consumer \nfind fees more easily on HELOC accounts. The Board understands that consumers may use unsecured credit cards \ndifferently than HELOC accounts, even where the HELOC is linked to a credit card device. For example, consumers \nmay use unsecured credit cards to engage in a significant number of smaller transactions per billing cycle. On the \nother hand, consumers appear to use their HELOC accounts for only a small number of larger transactions each \nbilling cycle, even if those HELOCs are linked to credit card devices. Consumers may have more difficulty \nidentifying fees on unsecured credit cards when the fees are interspersed with transactions because of the large \nnumber of transactions shown on the periodic statement. The Board solicits comment on the typical number of \n\n\n\ntransactions and fees shown on periodic statements for HELOC accounts. The Board also solicits comment on the \nburden on creditors and the benefit to consumers of requiring fees to be grouped together on periodic statements \nfor HELOC accounts.\n\nCost totals for the statement period and year to date. Under this proposal, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b would be required to disclose the total amount of interest charges and fees for the statement period and \ncalendar year to date. See proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(ii) and (iii). The Board believes that providing consumers with \nthe total of interest and fee costs, expressed in dollars, for the statement period and year to date would be a \nsignificant enhancement to consumers' ability to understand the overall cost of credit for the account. The Board's \nconsumer testing on credit card disclosures in relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule indicates that \nconsumers notice and understand credit costs expressed in dollars. In addition, year-to-date cost information \nenables consumers to evaluate how the use of an account may impact the amount of interest and fees charged \nover the year and thus promotes the informed use of credit.\n\nProposed comment 7(a)(6)-3 provides guidance on how creditors may disclose the year-to-date totals at the end of \na calendar year on monthly and quarterly statements. Proposed comment 7(a)(6)-5 provides guidance on creditors' \nduty to reflect refunded fees or interest in year-to-date totals.\n\nProposed comments 7(a)-6 and -7 clarify a creditor's obligations under \u00a7 227.7(a)(6) when it acquires a HELOC \naccount from another creditor or when a creditor replaces one HELOC account it has with a consumer with another \nHELOC account. The proposed comments would generally provide that the creditor must include the interest \ncharges and fees incurred by the consumer prior to the account acquisition or replacement in the aggregate totals \nprovided for the statement period and calendar year to date after the change. At the creditor's option, the creditor \nwould be allowed to add the prior charges and fees to the disclosed totals following the change, or it may provide \nseparate totals for each time period. Comment is requested regarding the operational issues associated with \ncarrying over cost totals in the circumstances described in the proposed commentary.\n\nFormat requirements. Under proposed \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(i), interest charges and fees must be grouped together and \nlisted in proximity to transactions identified under \u00a7 226.7(a)(2), in a manner substantially similar to proposed \nSample G-24(A) in Appendix G to part 226. In consumer testing conducted by the Board on credit card disclosures \nin relation to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, consumers consistently reviewed transactions identified on their \nperiodic statements and noticed fees and interest charges when they were grouped together, and disclosed in \nproximity to the transactions on the statement. The Board believes that similar results would exist with respect to \nHELOC accounts. Some HELOC creditors also disclose these costs in account summaries or in a progression of \nfigures associated with disclosing finance charges attributable to periodic interest rates. This proposal does not \naffect creditors' flexibility to provide this information in these summaries. See proposed Samples G-24(B) and G-\n24(C), which illustrate, but do not require, these summaries. Nonetheless, creditors would be required to group \ninterest charges and fees together and list them in proximity to transaction identified in \u00a7 226.7(a)(2), regardless of \nwhether these creditors also provide information about interest and fees in the account summaries. The Board \nbelieves that TILA's purpose to promote the informed use of credit would be furthered significantly if consumers are \nuniformly provided basic cost information--interest and fees--in a location they routinely review.\n\n7(a)(7) Change-in-Terms and Increased Penalty Rate Summary\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.9(c) and (i), the Board proposes to \nrequire creditors that provide a change-in-terms notice required by proposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1), or a rate increase notice \nrequired by proposed \u00a7 226.9(i), on or with the periodic statement, to disclose the information in proposed \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A) or proposed \u00a7 226.9(i)(3) on the periodic statement in accordance with the format requirements in \nproposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B), and proposed \u00a7 226.9(i)(4).\n\n7(a)(8) Grace Period\n\n\n\nSection 226.7(a)(8), which implements TILA Section 127(b)(9), requires a creditor offering HELOCs subject to \n226.5b to disclose on the periodic statement the date by which or the time period within which the new balance or \nany portion of the new balance must be paid to avoid additional finance charges. 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(9). If such a \ntime period is provided, a creditor may, at its option and without disclosure, impose no finance charge if payment is \nreceived after the time period's expiration.\n\nComment 7(a)(8)-1 provides that although the creditor is required under \u00a7 226.7(a)(8) to indicate on the periodic \nstatement any time period the consumer may have to pay the balance outstanding without incurring additional \nfinance charges, no specific wording is required, so long as the language used is consistent with that used on the \naccount-opening disclosure statement.\n\nThe Board proposes to revise this comment to provide that in describing the grace period, the language used must \nbe consistent with that used on the account-opening disclosure statement and to cross reference proposed \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2)(xxi) that contains required terminology that a creditor must use in describing a grace period beneath the \naccount-opening table described in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(1). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to \nproposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xxi), the Board proposes to require that a creditor disclose below the account-opening table \nthe date by which or the period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge \ndue to a periodic interest rate and any conditions on the availability of the grace period. In disclosing a grace period \nthat applies to all features on the account, the Board proposes to require a creditor to use the phrase \"How to \nAvoid Paying Interest\" as the heading for the information below the table describing the grace period.\n\n7(a)(9) Address for Notice of Billing Errors\n\nConsumers who allege billing errors must do so in writing. See 15 U.S.C. 1666; \u00a7 226.13(b). Section 226.7(a)(9), \nwhich implements TILA Section 127(b)(10), requires creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b must provide on \nor with periodic statements an address for this purpose. 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(10). Former comment 7(k)-1 provides \nthat creditors may also provide a telephone number along with the mailing address as long as the creditor makes \nclear a telephone call to the creditor will not preserve consumers' billing error rights. In many cases, an inquiry or \nquestion can be resolved in a phone conversation, without requiring the consumer and creditor to engage in a \nformal error resolution procedure.\n\nIn the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board moved this comment to 7(a)(9)-2 and updated it to address \nnotification by e-mail or via a Web site. Specifically, this comment states that the address is deemed to be clear and \nconspicuous if a precautionary instruction is included that telephoning or notifying the creditor by e-mail or via a \nWeb site will not preserve the consumer's billing rights, unless the creditor has agreed to treat billing error notices \nprovided by electronic means as written notices, in which case the precautionary instruction is required only for \ntelephoning. (See also comment 13(b)-2, which addresses circumstances under which electronic notices are \ndeemed to satisfy the written billing error requirement.) This rule gives consumers flexibility to attempt to resolve \ninquiries or questions about billing statements informally, while advising them that if the matter is not resolved in a \ntelephone call or via e-mail, mail, the consumer must submit a written inquiry to preserve billing error rights. Under \nthis proposal, the revised comment would be retained in 7(a)(9)-2.\n\n7(a)(10) Closing Date of Billing Cycle; New Balance\n\nSection 226.7(a)(10), which implements TILA Section 127(b)(8), requires creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b to disclose the closing date of the billing cycle and the account balance outstanding on that date. 15 U.S.C. \n1637(b)(8). The Board proposes no changes to these disclosure requirements.\n\nLate-Payment Disclosures\n\nIn 2005, the Bankruptcy Act amended TILA to add Section 127(b)(12), which required creditors that charge a late-\npayment fee to disclose on the periodic statement (1) the payment due date, or, if the due date differs from when a \n\n\n\nlate-payment fee would be charged, the earliest date on which the late-payment fee may be charged, and (2) the \namount of the late-payment fee. See 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(12). In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board \nimplemented this section of TILA for open-end (not home-secured) plans. In addition, in the SUPPLEMENTARY \nINFORMATION to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board stated its intention to implement this section of \nTILA for HELOC accounts subject to \u00a7 226.5b as part of its review of rules affecting home-secured credit.\n\nThe Credit Card Act (cited above) was enacted in May 2009. Section 202 of the Credit Card Act amends TILA \nSection 127(b)(12) to provide that for a \"credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan,\" a credit card \nissuer that charges a late-payment fee must disclose in a conspicuous location on the periodic statement (1) the \npayment due date, or, if the due date differs from when a late-payment fee would be charged, the earliest date on \nwhich the late-payment fee may be charged, and (2) the amount of the late-payment fee. In addition, if a late \npayment may result in an increase in the APR applicable to the account, a credit card issuer also must provide on \nthe periodic statement a disclosure of this fact, along with the applicable penalty APR. The disclosure related to the \npenalty APR must be placed in close proximity to the due-date disclosure discussed above. Finally, if a credit card \nissuer is a financial institution which maintains branches or offices at which payments on a credit card account \nunder an open-end consumer credit plan are accepted from a cardholder in person, the date on which the \ncardholder makes a payment on the account at the branch or office must be considered to be the date on which the \npayment is made for determining whether a late-payment fee may be imposed due to the failure of the cardholder to \nmake payment by the due date for such payment. These amendments to TILA Section 127(b)(12) become effective \nFebruary 22, 2010. See Credit Card Act \u00a7 3.\n\nThe Board is interpreting the term \"credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan,\" as that term is \nused in TILA Section 127(b)(12), not to include HELOC accounts subject to \u00a7 226.5b, even if those accounts may \nbe accessed by a credit card device. Thus, the provisions in TILA Section 127(b)(12), as amended by the Credit \nCard Act, would not apply to HELOC accounts. The Board makes this interpretation pursuant to its authority in TILA \nSection 105(a) to prescribe regulations to carry out the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' \nability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), \n1604(a).\n\nIn addition, the Board does not propose to use its authority in TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments that are \nnecessary to effectuate the purposes of TILA to apply newly-revised TILA Section 127(b)(12) to HELOC accounts \nsubject to \u00a7 226.5b. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). The Board believes that the late-payment disclosures and the provision \nabout crediting of payments made at a financial institution's branches or offices are not needed for HELOC \naccounts to effectuate the purposes of TILA. The consequences to a consumer of not making the minimum \npayment by the due date are less severe for HELOC accounts than for unsecured credit cards. As discussed in \nmore detail below, unlike with unsecured credit cards, creditors offering HELOC accounts subject to \u00a7 226.5b \ntypically do not impose a late-payment fee until 10-15 days after the payment is due. In addition, under the \nproposal, creditors offering HELOC accounts would be restricted from terminating and accelerating the account, \npermanently suspending the account or reducing the credit line, or imposing penalty rates or penalty fees (except \nfor the contractual late-payment fee) for a consumer's failure to pay the minimum payment due on the account, \nunless the payment is more than 30 days late.\n\nLate-payment fee. For HELOC accounts, the Board does not believe that disclosure of the late-payment fee is \nneeded on the periodic statement to effectuate the purposes of TILA. The Board understands that creditors offering \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b generally are restricted by state law, or the terms of the account agreement or both, \nfrom imposing a late-payment fee until a certain number of days have elapsed following a due date--typically 10-15 \ndays after the due date. In contrast, most unsecured credit card issuers will impose a late-payment fee if the \npayment is not received by the due date. Some unsecured credit card issuers may provide informal \"courtesy \nperiods\" that are not part of the legal agreement where the card issuer will not impose a late-payment fee if a \ncardholder's payment is received after the due date but before the end of the \"courtesy period.\" Nonetheless, these \n\"courtesy periods\" are typically only one to three days, not 10-15 days long.\n\n\n\nIn addition, some unsecured credit card issuers currently consider payment in person at their branches or offices to \nbe non-conforming payments, and thus, under current Regulation Z, may delay crediting of these payments for up \nto five days after these payments are received at the branch or office. See current \u00a7 226.10(b). Under the Credit \nCard Act, unsecured credit card issuers must consider the date on which a person makes payment in person at the \nissuer's branches or offices as the date on which the payment is made for determining whether a late-payment fee \nmay be imposed. By contrast, even if creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b treat payments in person at \nbranches or offices as non-conforming payments and delay crediting of these payments for up to five days after the \npayments are received, this delay in crediting typically will not result in late-payment fees because, as discussed \nabove, creditors for HELOC accounts typically do not impose late-payment fees until the account is 10-15 days past \ndue.\n\nPenalty rates and fees. Under the Credit Card Act, if a late payment may result in an increase in the APR applicable \nto the account, a credit card issuer offering an unsecured credit card account must provide on the periodic \nstatement a disclosure that a late payment may result in a penalty APR, along with the applicable penalty APR. For \nunsecured credit card accounts, some credit card issuers currently increase the rates applicable to both existing \nbalances and new transactions on a consumer's account to a penalty rate if a consumer does not pay by the due \ndate just one time. Under Section 101 of the Credit Card Act, unsecured credit card issuers would be restricted from \nincreasing a rate or fee during the first year after an account is opened unless the consumer is more than 60 days \nlate in making the minimum payment, in which case the creditor could apply the increase rate or fee to existing \nbalances and new transactions. See Credit Card Act \u00a7 101(b). After the first year an account is opened, unsecured \ncredit card issuers may increase rates or fees on new transactions for a late payment, even if the consumer is only \none day late in making the minimum payment. If the consumer is more than 60 days late, an unsecured credit card \nissuer may increase the rates or fees on all transactions (including existing balances). Credit Card Act \u00a7 101(d). \nThese provisions become effective February 22, 2010. See Credit Card Act \u00a7 3.\n\nThe Board does not believe that a disclosure of the penalty APR on the periodic statement is needed for HELOC \naccounts to effectuate the purposes of TILA. In this proposal, the Board proposes strict limits on when penalty rates \nor penalty fees may be imposed for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to \n\u00a7 226.5b(f), the Board proposes to restrict creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b from imposing a penalty \nrate or penalty fees (except for a contractual late-payment fee) on the account for a consumer's failure to pay the \naccount when due, unless the consumer is more than 30 days late in paying the account. As discussed above, \nunder the Credit Card Act, after the first year an account is opened, unsecured credit card issuers may increase \nrates or fees on new transactions for a late payment, even if the consumer is only one day late in making the \nminimum payment. Unlike with unsecured credit cards, even after the first year that the account is open, creditors \noffering HELOC accounts subject to \u00a7 226.5b could not impose penalty rates or penalty fees (except for a \ncontractual late-payment fee) on new transactions for a consumer's failure to pay the minimum payment on the \naccount, unless the consumer's payment is more than 30 days late.\n\nOther actions. Under the proposal, HELOC creditors would not be restricted from temporarily suspending the \naccount or reducing the line if a consumer does not pay by the due date (assuming that failure to pay by the due \ndate is considered a default of a material obligation under the HELOC contract). See \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C). \nNonetheless, even though creditors may have the right under the HELOC contract to suspend temporarily the \naccount or reduce the credit line if a consumer does not pay by the due date (i.e., one day delinquent on the \naccount), the Board understands that creditors typically do not temporarily suspend the account or reduce the credit \nline until the consumer's payment is at least 10-15 days late on the account, and oftentimes later.\n\nFor all the reasons discussed above, the Board does not propose to use its authority under TILA Section 105(a) to \nrequire creditors offering HELOC accounts subject to \u00a7 226.5b to provide the late-payment disclosures on periodic \nstatements, or to comply with the provision about crediting of payments made at a financial institution's branches or \noffices, as set forth in the Credit Card Act. The Board solicits comment on this aspect of the proposal.\n\nMinimum Payment Disclosures\n\n\n\nThe Bankruptcy Act added TILA Section 127(b)(11) to require creditors that extend open-end credit to provide a \ndisclosure on the front of each periodic statement in a prominent location about the effects of making only minimum \npayments. 15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(11). This disclosure included: (1) A \"warning\" statement indicating that making only \nthe minimum payment will increase the interest the consumer pays and the time it takes to repay the consumer's \nbalance; (2) a hypothetical example of how long it would take to pay off a specified balance if only minimum \npayments are made; and (3) a toll-free telephone number that the consumer may call to obtain an estimate of the \ntime it would take to repay his or her actual account balance.\n\nIn the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board implemented this section of TILA. In that rulemaking, the Board \nlimited the minimum payment disclosures required by the Bankruptcy Act to credit card accounts, pursuant to the \nBoard's authority under TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments that are necessary to effectuate the purposes of \nTILA. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). The Board exempted all HELOC accounts from the minimum payment disclosures \nrequired by the Bankruptcy Act, even where the HELOC account could be accessed by a credit card device. In the \nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board explained that the minimum \npayment disclosures would not appear to provide additional information to consumers that is not already disclosed \nto them with the application under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(i) and at account opening under \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii). Specifically, \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(5)(i) requires a creditor to disclose with the application the length of the draw period and any repayment \nperiod. A creditor is also required to provide this information at account opening under \u00a7 226.6(a)(3)(ii). The Board \nstated that these disclosures appear to be sufficient for HELOC consumers because, unlike most unsecured credit \ncard accounts, most HELOCs have a fixed repayment period determinable at the outset of the plan. In addition, the \nBoard stated that the cost to creditors of providing this information a second time, including the costs to reprogram \nperiodic statement systems and to establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number, appeared not to be justified \nby the limited benefit to consumers.\n\nThe Credit Card Act substantially revised this section of TILA. Specifically, Section 201 of the Credit Card Act \namends TILA Section 127(b)(11) to provide that creditors that extend open-end credit must provide the following \ndisclosures on each periodic statement: (1) A \"warning\" statement indicating that making only the minimum \npayment will increase the interest the consumer pays and the time it takes to repay the consumer's balance; (2) the \nnumber of months that it would take to repay the outstanding balance if the consumer pays only the required \nminimum monthly payments and if no further advances are made; (3) the total cost to the consumer, including \ninterest and principal payments, of paying that balance in full, if the consumer pays only the required minimum \nmonthly payments and if no further advances are made; (4) the monthly payment amount that would be required for \nthe consumer to eliminate the outstanding balance in 36 months, if no further advances are made, and the total cost \nto the consumer, including interest and principal payments, of paying that balance in full if the consumer pays the \nbalance over 36 months; and (5) a toll-free telephone number at which the consumer may receive information about \naccessing credit counseling and debt management services. See Credit Card Act \u00a7 201. These provisions become \neffective February 22, 2010. See Credit Card Act \u00a7 3.\n\nThe Board proposes that the minimum payment disclosures required by TILA Section 127(b)(11), as amended by \nthe Credit Card Act, not apply to HELOC accounts, including HELOC accounts that can be accessed by a credit \ncard device. The Board proposes this rule pursuant to its exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section \n105. Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which \ninclude facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of \ncredit. See 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Section 105(f) authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions \nfrom coverage under any part of TILA if the Board determines that coverage under that part does not provide a \nmeaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). The \nBoard must make this determination in light of specific factors. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2). These factors are (1) the \namount of the loan and whether the disclosure provides a benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction \ninvolving a loan of such amount; (2) the extent to which the requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more \nexpensive the credit process; (3) the status of the borrower, including any related financial arrangements of the \nborrower, the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction, and the importance to the \nborrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage under TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the \n\n\n\nprincipal residence of the borrower; and (5) whether the exemption would undermine the goal of consumer \nprotection.\n\nThe Board has considered each of these factors carefully, and based on that review, believes that the proposed \nexemption is appropriate. The Board believes that the minimum payment disclosures in the Credit Card Act would \nbe of limited benefit to consumers for HELOC accounts and are not necessary to effectuate the purposes of TILA. \nAs discussed above, the Board understands that most HELOCs have a fixed repayment period. Under the \nproposal, creditors offering HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b would be required to disclose the length of the plan, the \nlength of the draw period and the length of any repayment period in the disclosures that must be given within three \nbusiness days after application (but not later than account opening). See proposed \u00a7 226.5b(d)(9)(i). In addition, \nthis information also must be disclosed at account opening under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v)(A). Thus, for a HELOC \naccount with a fixed repayment period, a consumer could learn from those disclosures the amount of time it would \ntake to repay the HELOC account if the consumer only makes required minimum payments. The cost to creditors of \nproviding this information a second time, including the costs to reprogram periodic statement systems, appears not \nto be justified by the limited benefit to consumers.\n\nIn addition, the Board does not believe that the disclosure about total cost to the consumer of paying that balance in \nfull (if the consumer pays only the required minimum monthly payments and if no further advances are made) would \nbe useful to consumers for HELOC accounts. The Board understands that HELOC consumers intend to finance the \ntransactions made on the HELOC account over a number of years, and often will not have the ability to repay the \nbalances on the HELOC account at the end of each billing cycle, or even within a few years. By contrast, \nconsumers tend to use unsecured credit cards to engage in a significant number of small dollar transactions per \nbilling cycle, and may not intend to finance these transactions for many years. HELOC consumers, however, tend to \nuse HELOC accounts for larger transactions that they can finance at a lower interest rate than is offered on \nunsecured credit cards, and intend to repay these transactions over the life of the HELOC account. To illustrate, the \nBoard's 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances data indicates that the median balance on HELOCs (for families that \nhad a balance at the time of the interview) was $ 24,000, while the median balance on credit cards (for families that \nhad a balance at the time of the interview) was $ 3,000. 40\n\nThe nature of consumers' use of HELOCs also underlie the Board's belief that periodic disclosure of the monthly \npayment amount required for the consumer to eliminate the outstanding balance in 36 months, and the total cost to \nthe consumer of paying that balance in full if the consumer pays the balance over 36 months, would not provide \nuseful information to consumers for HELOC accounts.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Board proposes to exempt HELOC accounts (even when they are accessed by a credit \ncard account) from the minimum payment disclosure requirements set forth in TILA Section 127(b)(11), as revised \nby the Credit Card Act.\n\nFormat Requirements Related to Late-Payment and Minimum Payment Disclosures\n\nUnder the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are required to \ndisclose the payment due date on the front side of the first page of the periodic statement. The amount of any late-\npayment fee and penalty APR that could be triggered by a late payment is required to be disclosed in close \nproximity to the due date. In addition, the ending balance and the minimum payment disclosures must be disclosed \n\n40 Brian Bucks,et al., Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances, \nFederal Reserve Bulletin (February 2009).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nclosely proximate to the minimum payment due. Also, the due date, late-payment fee, penalty APR, ending \nbalance, minimum payment due, and the minimum payment disclosures must be grouped together. See \u00a7 \n226.7(b)(13). In the Supplementary Information to the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board stated that these \nformatting requirements were intended to fulfill Congress' intent to have the new late payment and minimum \npayment disclosures enhance consumers' understanding of the consequences of paying late or making only \nminimum payments. Because the Board proposes not to require the late-payment disclosures (i.e., the due date, \nlate-payment fee and penalty APR) and the minimum payment disclosures for HELOC accounts, the Board \nproposes not to require the format requirements described above for HELOC accounts.\n\nSection 226.9 Subsequent Disclosure Requirements\n\nSection 226.9 sets forth a number of disclosure requirements that apply after a HELOC subject to \u00a7 226.5b is \nopened, including a requirement to provide at least 15 days' advance notice whenever a term required to be \ndisclosed in the account-opening disclosures is changed, and a requirement to provide notice of the action taken \nand specific reasons for the action when a HELOC creditor prohibits additional extensions of credit or reduces the \ncredit limit pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi).\n\n9(c) Change in Terms\n\nUnder \u00a7 226.9(c) of Regulation Z, a creditor must notify a consumer of certain changes to the terms of an open-end \nplan. The general rule has been that a change-in-terms notice must be given 15 days in advance of the effective \ndate of the change, with some exceptions. Advance notice has not been required in all cases; for example, if an \ninterest rate increases due to a consumer's default or delinquency, notice has been required, but not in advance of \nthe rate increase. In addition, no notice (either advance or contemporaneous) has been required if the specific \nchange is set forth in the account-opening disclosures.\n\nIn the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted a number of revisions to the requirements for change-in-\nterms notices. The revisions are intended to improve consumers' awareness about changes to their account terms \nor increased rates due to delinquency, default, or otherwise as a penalty, and to enhance consumers' ability to shop \nfor alternative financing before the changes become effective. First, the revisions expand the circumstances in \nwhich consumers receive advance notice of changed terms, or of increased rates due to delinquency or default or \notherwise as a penalty. Second, the revisions provide consumers with earlier notice. Third, the revisions introduce \nformat requirements to make the disclosures about changes in terms, or of increased rates due to delinquency, \ndefault or otherwise as a penalty, more effective.\n\nThe January 2009 revisions to the change-in-terms notice rules do not affect HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b; the \nrevised rules for credit card and other open-end (not home-secured) credit appear in \u00a7 226.9(c)(2) and 226.9(g) (for \nincreased rates due to delinquency, default or otherwise as a penalty), while the existing rules are preserved for \nHELOCs in \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). In the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board stated that the change-in-terms rules \nfor HELOCs would be addressed in the review of open-end (home-secured) credit.\n\nThe Board is proposing to revise the change-in-terms rules for HELOCs to parallel generally the revisions adopted \nfor open-end (not home-secured) credit, including with regard to the circumstances covered, timing, and format, \nalthough with some differences. The Board believes that the purposes underlying the revisions to the change-in-\nterms rules for open-end (not home-secured) credit--to improve consumers' awareness of changes in their account \nterms and to enhance consumers' ability to seek alternative sources of credit--are applicable to HELOC credit as \nwell. The proposed revisions to \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) are explained in the section-by-section discussion below. The \nproposal regarding notice of increased rates due to delinquency, default or otherwise as a penalty would be set \nforth in new \u00a7 226.9(i) and is explained in the section-by-section discussion of that section. In addition to the \nsubstantive changes discussed below, other minor revisions would be made, such as to change cross-references \nas appropriate for new or renumbered provisions, substitute examples and other wording appropriate for HELOCs \n\n\n\nfor wording appropriate for credit card accounts or other open-end (not home-secured) credit, or conform wording to \nthe revised wording in \u00a7 226.9(c)(2) for open-end (not home-secured) credit.\n\n9(c)(1) Rules Affecting Home-Equity Plans\n\nComment 9(c)(1)-1, which discusses changes that do not require notice because the specific change has been set \nforth in the account-opening disclosures, would be revised. First, the phrase \"Except as provided in \u00a7 226.9(i)\" \nwould be added, referring to the fact that under proposed new \u00a7 226.9(i), notice of increased rates due to \ndelinquency, default or otherwise as a penalty would be required under \u00a7 226.9(i) even though that change was set \nforth in the account-opening disclosures. Second, language referring to a rate increase occurring because a \npreferential rate ends (such as because the consumer is no longer employed by the creditor or because the \nconsumer no longer maintains a certain balance in a deposit account with the creditor) would be deleted because \nrate increases triggered by these events would require notice under proposed \u00a7 226.9(i), discussed below, even \nthough they would not require notice under \u00a7 226.9(c).\n\nComment 9(c)(1)-3 would be revised by deleting the phrase \"or increases the minimum payment\" as redundant, \nbecause the minimum payment is a required disclosure under \u00a7 226.6(a); the comment already requires notice of \nchanges affecting any term required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(a). This comment would also be revised to \ndelete the example referring to a grace period because the Board understands that grace periods (in which interest \ndoes not accrue on an outstanding balance) are not typical in HELOCs.\n\n9(c)(1)(i) Written Notice Required\n\nThe requirement for notice 15 days in advance of the effective date of a change would be changed to require notice \n45 days in advance, for the same reasons the Board adopted this requirement for open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit. As discussed in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board believes that the shorter notice periods \nsuggested by some commenters on the June 2007 Regulation Z Proposal, such as 30 days or one billing cycle, \nwould not provide consumers with sufficient time to shop for and possibly obtain alternative financing. The 45-day \nadvance notice requirement refers to when the change-in-terms notice must be sent, but as discussed in the June \n2007 Regulation Z Proposal, it may take several days for the consumer to receive the notice. As a result, as stated \nin the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board believes that the 45-day advance notice requirement will give \nconsumers, in most cases, at least one calendar month after receiving a change-in-terms notice to seek alternative \nfinancing or otherwise to mitigate the impact of an unexpected change in terms.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on whether 45 days is an appropriate period for the advance notice requirement for \nchanges in terms of HELOCs. Commenters are asked to address, for example, whether it may be more difficult to \nseek alternative financing or otherwise mitigate the impact of a change in terms for HELOCs than for credit card \naccounts, as well as whether, because changes in terms are more narrowly restricted for HELOCs than for credit \ncard accounts, the impact on consumers of term changes for HELOCs is likely to be less severe than for credit \ncards and thus the proposed time period is likely adequate.\n\nIn other changes to this paragraph, the phrase \"or the required minimum periodic payment is increased\" would be \ndeleted as redundant because the minimum payment is a required disclosure under current \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) \n(redesignated as proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(v)(B)); the rule already requires notice of changes affecting any term \nrequired to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(a). A sentence would be added to clarify that an increase in the rate due to \ndelinquency, default or otherwise as a penalty would require notice under proposed new \u00a7 226.9(i) rather than \nunder \u00a7 226.9(c)(1).\n\nRevisions would be made to comments 9(c)(1)(i)-1 through - 4 to refer to the proposed requirement for notice 45 \ndays in advance rather than 15 and to replace examples of changes appropriate for credit cards and other open-\nend (not home-secured) credit with examples more appropriate for HELOCs, or to replace examples that would not \nbe permissible for HELOCs with examples that would be permissible. In comment 9(c)(1)(i)-3, language referring to \na consumer's general acceptance of a creditor's contract reservation of the right to change terms, as well as other \n\n\n\nunilateral term changes, would be deleted, to avoid the possible inference that such changes in terms would be \npermissible under \u00a7 226.5b(f). In comment 9(c)(1)(i)-4, language would be added to clarify that a complete set of \naccount-opening disclosures containing the changed term does not qualify as a change-in-terms notice if \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1)(iii) applies. (Section 226.9(c)(1)(iii), as discussed below, would require that disclosures required to be in \na tabular format in the account-opening disclosures also appear in a tabular format, and meet other formatting \nrequirements, when the disclosed terms change. However, changes in other disclosures, not required to be in a \ntabular format at account opening, would not be subject to these requirements.)\n\nComment 9(c)(1)(i)-5, which discusses changes involving addition of a security interest or addition or substitution of \ncollateral, would be deleted because the Board believes it unlikely that any of these events would occur in the case \nof an existing HELOC. However, the Board solicits comment on whether the comment should be retained to cover \nthe possibility of such an event occurring.\n\nIn comment 9(c)(1)(i)-6 (redesignated as proposed comment 9(c)(1)(i)-5), the limitation to plans entered into on or \nafter November 7, 1989, would be deleted; it appears unlikely that any HELOCs opened before that date are still in \nexistence.\n\n9(c)(1)(ii) Charges Not Covered by Tabular Format Requirements of \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(ii) would be renumbered \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iv), as discussed below. The Board proposes to add, \nas new \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(ii), an exception to the requirement for written advance notice of changes in terms. The \nexception would apply to disclosures of charges not required to appear in a tabular format in the account-opening \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), and would parallel a similar exception for credit cards and other open-end (not \nhome-secured) credit in \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(ii). Under the exception, if a creditor increases a charge, or introduces a new \ncharge, required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) but not required to appear in the summary account-opening \ntable under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), the creditor may either provide advance written notice under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i), or provide \noral or written notice of the amount of the charge at a relevant time before the consumer agrees to or becomes \nobligated to pay the charge. Comment\n\n9(c)(1)(ii)-1 would discuss a fee for expedited delivery of a credit card as an example of how this exception would \noperate. Of course, any increase in a charge, or addition of a new charge, would have to be permissible under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f).\n\n9(c)(1)(iii) Disclosure Requirements\n\nCurrent \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii), regarding notices to restrict credit on HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, would be renumbered \nas \u00a7 226.9(j) and revised, as discussed below. The Board proposes to add, as new \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii), a provision \nspecifying the content and format of disclosures for certain changes in terms, similar to the new requirements for \nchange-in-terms notices for open-end (not home-secured) credit set forth in \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(iii). If any of the terms \nrequired to be provided at account opening in a tabular format under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) changes, the creditor would have \nto provide a summary of the changes (as set forth in proposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A)(1), similar to \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(2)(iii)(A)(1) for open-end (not home-secured) credit), in a tabular format (as set forth in \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B)(1), similar to \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(B)(1) for open-end (not home-secured) credit), with headings and \nformat substantially similar to any of the account-opening tables in G--15 in Appendix G.\n\nIn addition, the notice would be required to contain a statement that changes are being made to the account, a \nstatement indicating (if applicable) that the consumer has the right to opt out of the changes, the effective date of \nthe changes, and a statement (if applicable) that the consumer may find additional information about the \nsummarized changes, and other changes to the account, in the notice. These disclosures are in proposed \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1)(ii)(A)(2) through (5), similar to \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(A)(2) through (5) for open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit.\n\n\n\nTwo other disclosures required for open-end (not home-secured) credit, found in \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(A)(6) and (7), \nwould not be required for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. Section 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(A)(6) applies if a creditor is changing \na rate on an account other than the penalty rate, and requires a disclosure that if the penalty rate currently applies \nto the account, the new rate described in the notice will not apply to the consumer's account until the consumer's \naccount balances are no longer subject to the penalty rate. The Board believes that this situation is unlikely to occur \nfor HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b because of the restrictions on rate increases for these HELOCs. Section \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(2)(iii)(A)(7) applies if the change being disclosed is a rate increase, and requires a disclosure of the \nbalances to which the increased rate will apply. Section 226.9(c)(1)(iii) is not an appropriate location for this \ndisclosure, because in general rate increases for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, where permissible at all, must occur \nonly as specified in the credit agreement and therefore the notice of such an increase would be provided under \u00a7 \n226.9(i) rather than \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). A similar disclosure of the balances to which the increased rate would apply is \nproposed under \u00a7 226.9(i), as discussed below.\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B)(2) and (3), if the change-in-terms notice is included on or with a periodic \nstatement, the tabular summary required under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A)(1) must appear on the front of any page of the \nstatement, immediately following the other items required to be disclosed (as specified in \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A)(2) \nthrough (5)). If the notice is not included on or with a periodic statement, the tabular summary must appear on the \nfront of the first page of the notice or segregated on a separate page from other information given with the notice, \nimmediately following the other items. These requirements would be similar to those applicable to open-end (not \nhome-secured) credit, as set forth in \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(B)(2) and (3).\n\nThe Board is proposing these content and format rules for the same reasons as for the new open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit rules adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule. As discussed in the January 2009 Regulation \nZ Rule, consumer testing conducted on behalf of the Board suggests that consumers tend to set aside change-in-\nterms notices when they are presented as a separate pamphlet inserted in the periodic statement. In addition, \ntesting prior to the June 2007 Regulation Z Proposal also revealed that consumers are more likely to identify the \nchanges to their account correctly if the changes in terms are summarized in a tabular format. Quantitative \nconsumer testing conducted in the fall of 2008 confirmed that disclosing a change in terms in a tabular summary on \nthe statement (versus a disclosure on the statement indicating that changes were being made to the account and \nreferring to a separate change-in-terms insert) led to a small increase in the percentage of consumers who were \nable to identify correctly the new rate that would apply to the account following the change. As stated in the January \n2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board believes that as consumers become more familiar with the new format for the \nchange-in-terms summary, which was new to all testing participants, they may become better able to recognize and \nunderstand the information presented. The same could be expected to apply to the change-in-terms summary for \nHELOCs.\n\nAlthough the Board has not yet conducted consumer testing of change-in-terms notices for HELOCs, consumer \ntesting of disclosures provided at application and account-opening for HELOCs indicates, as discussed above, that \nconsumers find disclosures presented in a tabular format more useful and understandable than disclosures in the \ncurrent format; thus the Board proposes to require such a format for the HELOC application and account-opening \ndisclosures. A tabular format standard for change-in-terms notices for HELOCs would be consistent with this \napproach and could be expected to result in greater noticeability and consumer comprehension of HELOC change-\nin-terms notices. The Board intends to conduct consumer testing of tabular-format change-in-terms notices for \nHELOCs during the comment period on this proposal.\n\nProposed comments 9(c)(1)(iii)(A)-1 through -10 provide guidance on the change-in-terms disclosures required \nunder \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A), and parallel comments 9(c)(2)(iii)(A)-1 through 10 applying to open-end (not home-\nsecured) credit change-in-terms disclosures. The changes discussed in comments 9(c)(1)(iii)(A)-1 through-7 might \nor might not be permissible under \u00a7 226.5b(f) depending upon the circumstances; therefore, language would be \nincluded in each of these comments to refer to change in terms restrictions for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, to \navoid implying that the changes discussed would be permissible in all cases.\n\n\n\n9(c)(1)(iv) Notice Not Required\n\nSection 226.9(c)(1)(ii) in the current regulation (as modified by the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule) relates to \nchanges for which a change-in-terms notice is not required (reduction of any component of a finance or other \ncharge or when the change results from an agreement involving a court proceeding), and would be renumbered \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1)(iv). Language would be added to clarify that suspension of credit privileges, reduction of a credit limit, or \ntermination of an account would not require notice under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i), but must be disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 \n226.9(j), discussed below.\n\nIn comment 9(c)(1)(ii)-1 (renumbered comment 9(c)(1)(iv)-1), two examples of changes not requiring notice--\nparagraphs i. (change in the consumer's credit limit) and iv. (termination or suspension of credit privileges)--would \nbe deleted, because such actions (assuming they were permissible under \u00a7 226.5b(f)) would require notice, \nalthough notice under \u00a7 226.9(j) rather than \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i). A new paragraph iv. would be added to clarify that \nsuspension of credit privileges, reduction of a credit limit, or termination of an account would not require notice \nunder \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i), but must be disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 226.9(j). In paragraph v. (changes arising merely by \noperation of law; renumbered paragraph iii.), the example given (the creditor's security interest in a consumer's car \nautomatically extending to the proceeds when the consumer sells the car) would be deleted as unlikely to apply to \nHELOC accounts.\n\nIn comment 9(c)(1)(ii)-2 (renumbered comment 9(c)(1)(iv)-2), relating to skip features and temporary reductions in \nfinance charges, language would be added to clarify that the actions discussed would be permissible as beneficial \nchanges under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iv), and that a creditor offering a temporary reduction in an interest rate must provide \na notice complying with the timing, content, and format requirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) prior to resuming the original \nrate. The latter addition parallels a clarification to the comparable comment 9(c)(2)(iv)-2, applying to open-end (not \nhome-secured) credit, proposed for comment in the May 2009 Regulation Z Proposal.\n\nNew comments 9(c)(1)(iv)-3 and - 4, similar to comments 9(c)(2)(iv)-3 and - 4 for open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit, would be added. These comments would clarify that if a creditor changes a rate from a variable rate to a \nnon-variable rate, or vice versa (assuming such action is permissible under \u00a7 226.5b(f)), a change-in-terms notice \nmust be provided even if the immediate effect of the change is a lower rate.\n\n9(i) Increase in Rates Due to Delinquency or Default or as a Penalty--Rules Affecting Home-Equity Plans\n\nAs discussed above under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i), an increase in the rate due to delinquency, default, or as a penalty, \npursuant to the contractual terms of the consumer's account, would not require notice under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1), but \nwould require a notice under proposed new \u00a7 226.9(i). Under the previous version of Regulation Z for credit cards \nand other open-end (not home-secured) credit (and the current version for HELOCs), if the agreement between the \nconsumer and the creditor specifically sets forth a change that will take place upon the occurrence of a specific \ntriggering event, a change-in-terms notice is not required when the change occurs. This rule was changed in the \nJanuary 2009 Regulation Z Rule for open-end (not home-secured) credit by the addition of new \u00a7 226.9(g).\n\nIn discussing \u00a7 226.9(g) in the June 2007 Regulation Z Proposal and the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the \nBoard expressed concern that the imposition of penalty rates might come as a costly surprise to consumers who \nare not aware of, or do not understand, what behavior constitutes a default under the credit agreement, even \nthough for credit card and other open-end (not home-secured) credit, the account-opening disclosures are required \nto set forth the penalty rate. The Board also stated that it believed that consumers would be the most likely to notice \nand be motivated to act to avoid the imposition of the penalty rate if they receive a specific notice alerting them of \nan imminent rate increase, rather than a general disclosure stating the circumstances when a rate might increase.\n\nIn the case of HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, the same reasoning could be expected to apply. In addition, because \nthe proposed account-opening disclosures for HELOCs do not include a disclosure of the penalty rate, providing \nnotice to a consumer at the time the penalty rate is imposed is even more important. Therefore, the Board proposes \n\n\n\nto add new \u00a7 226.9(i) applying to HELOCs, which would generally parallel \u00a7 226.9(g) applying to open-end (not \nhome-secured) credit.\n\nSection 226.9(i)(1) would require that a creditor must provide written notice to each consumer who may be affected \nwhen a rate is increased due to the consumer's delinquency or default or otherwise as a penalty for one or more \nevents specified in the account agreement. Rate increases could only occur, of course, as permitted under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f). Section 226.9(i)(2) would require that the notice be provided at least 45 days before the effective date of \nthe increase, and after the occurrence of the events that trigger the imposition of the increase.\n\nSection 226.9(i)(3) would specify the content of the notice, which would include a statement that the delinquency or \ndefault rate, or other penalty rate, has been triggered (\u00a7 226.9(i)(3)(i)); the date on which the increased rate will \napply (\u00a7 226.9(i)(3)(ii)); the circumstances under which the increased rate will cease to apply to the consumer's \naccount, or that the increased rate will remain in effect for a potentially indefinite time period (\u00a7 226.9(i)(3)(iii)); and \na disclosure indicating to which balances the increased rate will apply (\u00a7 226.9(i)(3)(iv)). These disclosures parallel \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(i). One other disclosure under \u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(i), however, would not be included in \u00a7 \n226.9(i)(3): A description of any balances to which the current rate will continue to apply (\u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(i)(E)). For \ncredit cards, under the Credit Card Act (cited above), in some circumstances increases in rates may be permitted to \napply only to future balances; in other cases rate increases may apply to all balances, including outstanding \nbalances. See Credit Card Act \u00a7 101(b) and (d). In contrast, rate increases for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, where \npermissible at all (i.e., for a reason that would permit termination and acceleration of the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)), \nwould generally apply to all balances. Thus, the disclosure under \u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(i)(E) would not appear appropriate \nfor HELOCs. However, the disclosure under \u00a7 226.9(i)(3)(i)(D) may be useful to indicate, for example, whether a \nrate increase would apply to balances under the regular variable-rate feature of a HELOC, while not applying to \nbalances under a fixed-rate option. The Board solicits comment on the appropriateness of this disclosure.\n\nSection 226.9(i)(4) would parallel \u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(ii) and would address format requirements. Section 226.9(i)(4)(i) \nwould provide that if the notice is included on or with a periodic statement, it must be in the form of a table and must \nappear on the front of any page of the periodic statement. Section 226.9(i)(4)(ii) would provide that if the notice is \nnot included on or with a periodic statement, the disclosures must be appear on the front of the first page of the \nnotice.\n\nSection 226.9(i)(5) would parallel \u00a7 226.9(g)(4)(i) and would provide an exception for workout and temporary \nhardship arrangements, where the rate increases due to completion of the arrangement, or for failure to comply with \nthe terms of the arrangement, provided that the increased rate does not exceed the rate that applied before the \nstart of the arrangement. Two other exceptions in \u00a7 226.9(g)(4) would not be included in \u00a7 226.9(i)(5): A rate \nincrease where the credit limit is exceeded, and a rate increase applicable to outstanding balances where a notice \nhad already been provided of a rate increase on future balances. The first situation would not arise for HELOCs \nsubject to \u00a7 226.5b because, under \u00a7 226.5b(f), a creditor may not increase an interest rate based on the credit limit \nbeing exceeded. The second situation also likely would not arise for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b because, as \ndiscussed above, a rate increase for a HELOC, if permissible at all, would not apply to future balances differently \nthan to outstanding balances.\n\nComments 9(i)-1 through-5 would be added to the commentary and would provide general guidance regarding \nnotices of rate increases under \u00a7 226.9(i). The proposed comments would parallel comments 9(g)-2 through -6 \nunder \u00a7 226.9(g). A comment would not be added to parallel comment 9(g)-1, because that comment addresses the \nrelationship between the change-in-terms notice requirements (and notice of rate increase requirements) under \nRegulation Z and the requirements under Regulation AA (or similar law) regarding unfair or deceptive acts or \npractices in credit card accounts, which do not apply to HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b.\n\n9(j) Notices of Action Taken for Home-Equity Plans\n\nAs noted above, \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii), regarding notices to restrict credit for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, would be \nredesignated as \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) and revised. Proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) would retain the existing requirement that a \n\n\n\ncreditor provide the consumer with notice of temporary account suspension or credit limit reduction under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi), but with certain clarifications and additions. The proposal also would eliminate the \nexisting exemption from notice requirements for a creditor that suspends advances, reduces a credit limit, or \nterminates a plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3). See comment 9(c)(1)(iii)-2. Under proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(3), creditors taking \naction under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) would be required to provide the consumer with a notice of the action taken and specific \nreasons for the action. To facilitate compliance, model clauses are proposed to illustrate the requirements for these \nnotices. See proposed Model Clauses G--23(A) and G--23(B) in Appendix G of part 226.\n\n9(j)(1) Notice of Action Taken Under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) would retain the existing requirement that require a creditor taking action under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi) must provide to any consumer who will be affected notice of the action taken and specific \nreasons for the action within three business days of the action. The proposed paragraph, however, would require \nthe creditor to include a number of additional disclosures in the notice. The clarifications and additional disclosures \ndiscussed below are proposed in response to concerns expressed during outreach conducted by the Board that \ncreditors are not certain how to comply with the current notice requirements and that notices provided often contain \nunclear or incomplete information about the reasons for the action taken and the consumer's reinstatement rights. \nThe Board's independent review of notices of action taken currently used by creditors corroborated these concerns.\n\nFirst, proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(1)(i) and comment 9(j)(1)-1 clarify that, as part of the disclosure of the action taken, the \ncreditor must include the following basic information that the HELOC consumer whose credit privileges have been \nrestricted needs to make appropriate financial accommodations: (1) If the creditor reduced the credit limit, the new \ncredit limit; and (2) the date as of which the account suspension or reduction took effect.\n\nSecond, proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(1)(ii) requires disclosure of specific reasons for the action, and proposed comments \n9(j)(1)-2, -3, -4, and - 5 would provide additional guidance regarding what the creditor must disclose to comply with \nthis requirement. Proposed comment 9(j)(1)-2 requires that a creditor provide the principal reasons for the action \ntaken, and indicates that the principal reasons should include the reason permitting the action under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (vi), such as that the maximum APR has been reached or the value of property securing the plan \nhas significantly declined.\n\nProposed comment 9(j)(1)-3 sets forth information that, if disclosed, would constitute compliance with the \nrequirement to disclose the specific reasons for the action taken when the reason for the action taken is a \nsignificant decline in the property value under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A). Specifically, compliance with the requirement \nwould be met by disclosing the following information--\n\n(i) The value of the property obtained by the creditor.\n\n(ii) The type of valuation method used to obtain the property value.\n\n(iii) A statement that the consumer has a right to a copy of documentation supporting the property value on which \nthe action was based.\n\nThe Board believes that the property value on which the creditor relied to freeze or reduce a line, and access to \ninformation about the basis for that property value finding, are integral components of the \"specific reasons\" \ndisclosure required when a creditor freezes or reduces a line due to a significant decline in the property value. This \ninformation is also necessary for the consumer to assess whether and when to challenge the finding and request \nreinstatement.\n\nProposed comment 9(j)(1)-4 sets forth information that, if disclosed, would constitute compliance with the \nrequirement to disclose the specific reasons for the action taken when a creditor prohibits credit extensions or \nreduces a credit limit because the consumer's financial circumstances have materially changed such that the \ncreditor has a reasonable belief that the consumer will be unable to meet the repayment obligations of the plan \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B). Specifically, compliance with the provision would be met by disclosing the type of \n\n\n\ninformation concerning the consumer's financial circumstances on which the creditor relied, such as information \nabout the consumer's income, credit report information, or some other indicia of the consumer's financial \ncircumstances, as applicable.\n\nThe Board believes that more information than simply the regulatory reason for the action taken is an appropriate \nelement of the \"specific reasons\" disclosure requirement when action is taken due to a material change in the \nconsumer's financial circumstances under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(vi)(B). First, the type of financial information relied on (i.e., \nincome, credit report information) gives the consumer more \"specific\" reasons for the action taken than a disclosure \nsimply stating that the line was frozen or reduced because the consumer's financial circumstances have changed. \nSecond, the consumer is thereby better able to assess whether to request reinstatement and to address problems \nthat the consumer may be able to correct, such as errors in the consumer's credit report, credit performance \ndeficiencies, or inadequate or outdated income information.\n\nProposed comment 9(j)(1)-5 explains when a creditor takes action because the consumer defaulted on a material \nobligation under the agreement (see \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C)), the creditor would comply with this provision if it \nspecified the material obligation on which the consumer defaulted. The Board believes that the material obligation \non which the consumer defaulted is a key element of \"specific reasons\" disclosure requirement when action is \nbased on a consumer's default of a material obligation. With this information, the consumer would have an \nopportunity to correct a default or to dispute the creditor's determination that a default occurred. Either way, the \nconsumer would be in a better position to exercise his or her reinstatement right and to have credit privileges \nrestored.\n\nProposed comment 9(j)(1)-5 also addresses the specific reasons disclosure requirement for other reasons justifying \ntemporary line suspension or reduction. This includes the following: (1) the creditor is precluded by government \naction from imposing the APR provided for in the agreement (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D)); the priority of the creditor's \nsecurity interest is adversely affected by government action to the extent that the value of the security interest is \nless than 120 percent of the credit line (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(E)); the creditor is notified by its regulatory agency that \ncontinued advances constitute an unsafe and unsound practice (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(F)); and federal law prohibits the \ncreditor from extending credit under a plan or requires that the creditor reduce the credit limit for a plan (\u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(G)). For action based on these provisions, the Board believes that a statement of the regulatory \nreason for the action is sufficient to comply the \"specific reasons\" disclosure requirement. The principal reason for \nthis proposed approach is that the consumer is not likely to be able to take any steps to change the circumstances \njustifying the suspension or reduction.\n\nThe Board requests comment on whether more or less information than the information proposed would be \nappropriate to require to meet the \"specific reasons\" disclosure requirement when action is taken for any of the \nreasons permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi). The Board requests comment in particular on whether more \nor less information would be appropriate to require to meet the \"specific reasons\" disclosure requirement when \naction is taken due to a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B).\n\nDisclosure of information regarding reinstatement. Proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(1)(iii) requires the creditor to provide certain \ninformation when the creditor has opted to require that the consumer request reinstatement before the creditor will \nconsider restoring credit privileges. As in the existing commentary, the proposal would require that the creditor \ndisclose that the consumer must request reinstatement. Addressing concerns that creditors may provide inadequate \ninformation about reinstatement rights to consumers, the proposal would amplify existing requirements by requiring \nthat the creditor inform the consumer of his or her right to request reinstatement of the account at any time, and that \nthe creditor disclose the specific manner in which the consumer should request reinstatement, including the \naddress or telephone number to which the creditor must submit requests. In addition, the creditor must disclose that \nthe creditor will complete an investigation of the consumer's request within 30 days of receiving the request (as \nrequired under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(ii)). The purpose of these disclosures is to ensure that consumers \nunderstand their rights regarding an investigation.\n\n\n\nThe proposal also requires the creditor to disclose that, in accordance with proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(iii) and (iv), the \ncreditor may not charge the consumer for costs associated with the investigation of the consumer's first \nreinstatement request made after the creditor has suspended advances or reduced the credit limit, but may charge \nthe consumer bona fide and reasonable costs for property valuations or credit reports associated with investigations \nof any requests that the consumer makes after the first request. This provision is intended to put the consumer on \nnotice of the potential for additional costs when requesting reinstatement. The reasons for proposing the above \nrules regarding when creditors may charge consumers fees for investigating a reinstatement request are discussed \nin the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2).\n\n9(j)(2) Imposition of Fees\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(2) provides that a creditor that reduces the credit limit on an account under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or \n(vi) may not charge the consumer fees for exceeding the credit limit until after the consumer has received notice of \nthe action under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1). Similarly, after a creditor has suspended advances on an account, the creditor may \nnot charge the consumer a fee for any advance that it denies until the consumer receives the \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) notice. \nProposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(2) and comment 9(j)(2)-1 specify that in general only fees disclosed in the original agreement \nmay be charged and that these would be subject to the notice waiting period. Imposing denied advance or over-the-\nlimit fees not disclosed in the original agreement would be permitted only if an exception to the general limitations \non changing home-equity plan terms under \u00a7 226.5b(f) applies.\n\nThe Board believes that imposition of denied advance or over-the-limit fees before the consumer has notice of the \nsuspension on advances or credit limit reduction is inappropriate for at least two reasons. First, consumers who did \nnot yet receive the notice of action taken under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) presumably did not know of the credit limit reduction or \nsuspension of advances and may have attempted to access their home-equity funds with the good faith expectation \nthat these funds would be available to them. Second, in many cases, action taken under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi) \nis based on circumstances beyond the consumer's control, such as the maximum rate being reached or a \nsignificant decline in the value of the consumer's dwelling. Prohibiting creditors from imposing over-the-limit or \ndenied advance fees until consumers have appropriate notice of a suspension or credit limit reduction is intended to \nstrengthen the protection of consumers facing the financial challenge of a HELOC freeze or reduction.\n\nProposed comment 9(j)(2)-2 clarifies that, for purposes of determining when the consumer receives the notice, the \nmore precise definition of business day (meaning all calendar days except Sundays and specified federal holidays) \napplies referred to in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)-2. For example, if the creditor were to place the \ndisclosures in the mail on Thursday, June 4, under the proposal the disclosures would be considered received on \nMonday, June 8. The Board proposes that the more precise definition apply to determining when \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) \nnotices are received by the consumer to conform to the Board's rules for determining receipt of disclosures for other \ndwelling--secured transactions under \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(ii) and 226.31(c), as well as to the Board's recently adopted \nrules under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). See 74 FR 23289 (May 19, 2009).\n\nThe Board requests comment on this proposed limitation on when denied advance and over-the-limit fees may be \ncharged.\n\n9(j)(3) Notice of Action Taken Under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(2) would require creditors to provide a notice to each consumer affected by the creditor's \ntermination and acceleration of the account, suspension of advances on the account, or reduction of the credit limit \nunder circumstances permitting these actions pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2). This notice requirement is intended to \nremedy an inconsistency in the current rules--namely, that suspending or reducing lines under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and \n(f)(3)(vi) is required under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii) (redesignated and revised in the proposal as \u00a7 226.9(j)(1)), but no notice \nis required for any action taken under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2). The Board believes that this new notice requirement for \nactions taken under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) will enhance consumer protection and education by ensuring that affected \nconsumers will know why the action was taken. As with the current and proposed notice requirement for credit \n\n\n\nrestrictions under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi), the proposed notice for actions taken under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) is not \nrequired until three business days after the action is taken, rather than before the action is taken. The principal \nreason for this timing is that post-action notice protects creditors from the risk that consumer may immediately draw \ndown the line once they receive advance notice of the action; concerns about this risk were confirmed through \nBoard outreach in preparing this proposal. The Board's recognition of this risk is reflected in the longstanding policy \nof requiring notice for actions under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi) three business days after the action taken.\n\nAs indicated in proposed comment 5b(f)(2)-2, the specific reasons that a creditor must disclose when taking action \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) will vary, because \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) allows creditors to terminate and accelerate a home-equity \nplan or take a lesser action, such as suspending advances or reducing the credit limit, for four reasons: (1) \"Fraud \nor material misrepresentation on the part of the consumer in connection with the account\" (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(i)); (2) \nfailure of the consumer \"to make a required minimum periodic payment within 30 days after the due date for that \npayment\" (proposed \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii)); (3) \"any other action or failure to act by the consumer which adversely \naffects the creditor's security for the account or any right of the creditor to such security\" (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iii)); or, (4) \n\"compliance with federal law requires the creditor to terminate and demand repayment of the entire outstanding \nbalance in advance of the original term\" (in which case, lesser action would not be appropriate) (proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(2)(iv)).\n\nThus, proposed comment 9(j)(2)-2 explains that when a creditor takes action under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(i) for a \nconsumer's fraud or misrepresentation related to the home-equity plan, the creditor need only disclose that the \naction was taken due to either, as applicable, fraud or misrepresentation by the consumer; the creditor is not \nrequired to specify in the notice the nature of the fraud or misrepresentation. During Board outreach, creditors \nexpressed concerns that a requirement to disclose the specific nature of the fraud or misrepresentation could more \nreadily expose them to claims of libel or slander, whether spurious or not, than a generic disclosure that the \nconsumer's fraud or misrepresentation precipitated the creditor's action. Concerns were also expressed that, even if \nthe consumer in fact committed fraud or misrepresentation, a court may penalize the creditor for the particular way \nin which it phrased the nature of the fraud or misrepresentation in the notice. The Board requests comment on \nwhether the creditor should also be required to include on the notice a toll-free telephone number that the consumer \nmay call to receive additional information about the action taken and other information on the notice, particularly \nwhen the reason for the action is stated simply as fraud or material misrepresentation.\n\nAlso under proposed comment 5b(f)(2)-2, when a creditor takes action under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iii) for a consumer's \naction or inaction affecting the creditor's security interest, the creditor must include in the notice the consumer's \naction or inaction that threatens creditor's interest in the property securing the account, such as failing to pay \nproperty taxes or allowing a new superior lien on the property.\n\n9(j)(3) Notices Required When Action Other Than Termination, Suspension, or Credit Limit Reduction Is Taken \nUnder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(3) would require a creditor that takes action other than account termination, suspension, or \ncredit limit reduction under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2), such as a rate increase or fee, to disclose these changes according to \nthe 45-day advance notice requirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) (for fee changes) or (i) (for rate changes), as applicable. \nThe Board does not believe that advance notice for these actions jeopardizes the creditor's interest as in the case \nof account termination, suspension, or reduction, where a concern about the consumer drawing down the full line \nexists. By taking lesser action such as imposing a fee or rate increase, the creditor itself has determined that \nadequate risk management does not require taking away from the consumer full access to the account. The \nproposed provision is intended to enhance consumer protection and education for the reasons discussed in this \nsection-by-section analysis under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) and (i).\n\nSection 226.14 Determination of Annual Percentage Rate\n\n\n\nSection 226.14 contains rules for calculation of the APR for open-end credit. Section 226.14(a) states general rules \nfor determination of the APR, including rules on accuracy and good faith errors in disclosure. Section 226.14(b) \ncontains rules for calculation of the APR for disclosure at the time of application for open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit under \u00a7 226.5a or a HELOC under \u00a7 226.5b, at account opening under \u00a7 226.6, in change-in-terms notices \nunder \u00a7 226.9, in rescission notices under \u00a7 226.15, in advertising under \u00a7 226.16, and in oral disclosures under \u00a7 \n226.26. The APR is calculated for purposes of these disclosures, as stated in \u00a7 226.14(b), by multiplying each \nperiodic rate by the number of periods in a year.\nSection 226.14(b) also states the rules for calculation of the APR for disclosure on periodic statements for open-end \n(not home-secured) plans under \u00a7 226.7(b)(4), and for disclosure of the corresponding APR for HELOCs subject to \n\u00a7 226.5b under \u00a7 226.7(a)(4). The calculation rules for the \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) and (b)(4) disclosures are the same as \nthose stated above, i.e., multiply each periodic rate by the number of periods in a year. For HELOCs, creditors have \nthe option of disclosing, in addition to the corresponding APR, the effective APR under \u00a7 226.7(a)(7). The rules for \ncalculation of the effective APR for optional disclosure for HELOCs are set forth in \u00a7 226.14(c) and (d).\n\nAs discussed above under \u00a7 226.7, in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board eliminated the requirement to \ndisclose the effective APR for open-end (not home-secured) credit, and made the disclosure of the effective APR \noptional for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. As also discussed above under \u00a7 226.7, the Board is now proposing to \neliminate the disclosure of the effective APR for HELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b. Accordingly, the Board proposes to \ndelete \u00a7 226.14(c) and (d) and the accompanying staff commentary.\n\nSection 226.14(b) would be revised by replacing a reference to disclosures under various sections of the regulation \nwith a reference to disclosures under Subpart B, because with the elimination of the requirement to disclose the \neffective APR on periodic statements, \u00a7 226.14 would now provide rules for calculation of the APR for open-end \ndisclosures generally. Comment 14(b)-1 would be revised similarly. Comment 14(b)-1 would also be revised by \ndeleting a sentence referring to the \"corresponding annual percentage rate,\" because that term would now become \nobsolete; all disclosures of the annual percentage rate would use the term \"annual percentage rate\" or \"APR.\"\n\nAppendix F--Annual Percentage Rate Computations for Certain Open-End Credit Plans\n\nAppendix F contains guidance on calculation of the effective APR under \u00a7 226.14(c)(3) when the finance charge \nimposed during the billing cycle includes a charge relating to a specific transaction. As discussed above under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.7 and 226.14, the Board is proposing to eliminate the disclosure of the effective APR on periodic statements, \nand therefore is also proposing to delete \u00a7 226.14(c) and (d), which contain the rules for calculation of the effective \nAPR. If the effective APR disclosure is eliminated, Appendix F will have no further purpose. Accordingly, the Board \nproposes to remove and reserve Appendix F and the accompanying staff commentary.\n\nAppendix G--Open-End Model Forms and Clauses\n\nAppendix G to part 226 sets forth model forms, model clauses and sample forms that creditors may use to comply \nwith the requirements of Regulation Z for open-end credit. Although use of the model forms and clauses is not \nrequired, creditors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to those \ndisclosures.\n\nAs discussed in detail below, the Board proposes to modify the model clauses applicable to balance computation \nmethod disclosures, notices of liability for unauthorized use, and notices of billing-error rights; to add new model \nand sample forms for HELOC early disclosures and account-opening disclosures; to add new model clauses for \nnotices of results of reinstatement investigations and for notices of actions taken on accounts in HELOCs; and to \nadd new sample forms for HELOC periodic statements, change-in-terms notices, and notices of rate increases. In \naddition, as discussed below, the Board is proposing to adopt, for both open-end and closed-end credit, new \nsamples and models for disclosures relating to credit insurance, debt cancellation or debt suspension; for a detailed \ndiscussion of these proposed disclosures and the related proposed models and samples, refer to the notice of the \n\n\n\nBoard's proposal regarding closed-end mortgage lending requirements under Regulation Z, published today \nelsewhere in this Federal Register.\n\nThe staff commentary to Appendices G and H contains comment App. G and H-1, which discusses permissible \nchanges that creditors may make to the model forms and clauses without losing protection from liability for failure to \ncomply with the regulation's disclosure requirements. Comment App. G and H-1 also lists the models to which \nformatting changes may not be made because the related disclosure requirements provide that the disclosures \nmust be made in a form substantially similar to that in the models. The Board proposes to revise comment App. G \nand H-1 by adding a number of proposed new open-end and closed-end models to this list.\n\nModel clauses for balance computation methods. Under various sections of the regulation, creditors are required to \ndisclose the method of calculating the balance to which rates are applied. See \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a(b)(6), 226.6(b)(2)(vi), \n226.6(b)(4)(i)(D), and 226.7(b)(5), and proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xxii), 226.6(a)(4)(i)(D), and 226.7(a)(5). Under \nsome of these provisions, the creditor is permitted in some circumstances to identify the name of the balance \ncalculation method, but under others the creditor must in either some or all cases provide an explanation of how the \nbalance was calculated. Model Clauses that explain commonly used methods, such as the average daily balance \nmethod, are at Appendices G--1 and G--1(A) to part 226.\n\nIn the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule, Appendix G--1(A) was added for open-end (not home-secured) plans. The \nclauses in Appendix G--1(A) refer to \"interest charges\" rather than \"finance charges\" to explain balance \ncomputation methods. The consumer testing conducted by the Board prior to the June 2007 Regulation Z Proposal \nindicated that consumers generally had a better understanding of \"interest charge\" than \"finance charge,\" which is \nreflected in the Board's use of \"interest\" (rather than \"finance charge\") in account-opening samples and to describe \ncosts other than fees on periodic statement samples and forms in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule. For \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule permits creditors to use the model clauses in \neither Appendix G--1 or G--1(A).\n\nConsumer testing conducted for the Board during the development of this proposal for HELOCs confirms that \nconsumers generally understand \"interest charge\" better than \"finance charge.\" As discussed above under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.5b, 226.6, and 226.7, the Board is accordingly proposing to require use of \"interest charge\" in HELOC \ndisclosures. Therefore, the Board proposes to delete current Appendix G--1 and to redesignate Appendix G--1(A) \nas Appendix G--1 for use by all creditors offering open-end credit, both HELOCs and open-end (not home-secured) \ncredit. In addition, the commentary would be revised to delete material that refers only to the existing version of \nAppendix G--1, or that indicates that HELOC creditors have the option to use either Appendix G--1 or G--1(A).\n\nModel clauses for notice of liability for unauthorized use and billing-error rights. Appendix G contains Model Clauses \nG--2 and G--2(A), which provide models for the notice of liability for unauthorized use of a credit card. In the \nJanuary 2009 Regulation Z Rule, the Board adopted Model Clause G--2(A) for open-end (not home-secured) plans. \nModel Clause G--2(A) does not differ in substance from Model Clause G--2, but was revised to improve readability. \nIn addition, Appendix G includes Model Forms G--3 and G--3(A), which contain models for the long-form billing-\nerror rights statement (for use with the account-opening disclosures and as an annual disclosure or, at the creditor's \noption, with each periodic statement), and G--4 and G--4(A), which contain models for the alternative billing-error \nrights statement (for use with each periodic statement). As with Model Clause G--2, the Board adopted Model \nForms G--3(A) and G--4(A) for open-end (not home-secured) plans, with revisions to improve readability. For \nHELOCs subject to \u00a7 226.5b, the January 2009 Regulation Z rule permits a creditor to use either the current forms \n(G--2, G--3, and G--4) or the revised forms (G--2(A), G--3(A), and G--4(A)), in order to avoid requiring HELOC \ncreditors to make forms changes pending the completion of the Board's HELOC review.\n\nRevised Model clauses and forms G--2(A), G--3(A), and G--4(A) adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule \nare fully applicable to HELOCs, and represent improvements on models G--2, G--3, and G--4 in terms of readability. \nTherefore, the Board proposes to delete current G--2, G--3, and G--4, and to redesignate G--2(A), G--3(A), and G--\n4(A) as G--2, G--3, and G--4, respectively, for use by all creditors offering open-end credit, both HELOCs and open-\nend (not home-secured) credit. A technical correction would be made in the titles of Model Forms G--3 and G--4 in \n\n\n\nthe table of contents to Appendix G. In addition, the commentary would be revised to delete material that refers to \nexisting versions of G--2, G--3, or G--4, or that indicates that HELOC creditors have the option to use either the old \nor the new versions.\n\nModel and sample forms applicable to HELOC early disclosures and account-opening disclosures. Currently, \nAppendix G contains three sample and model forms and clauses related to the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.5b at \nthe time a consumer submits an application for a HELOC: G--14A and G--14B, which are sample application \ndisclosures, and G--15, which contains model clauses that may be used as applicable in a creditor's HELOC \napplication disclosure. Appendix G does not currently contain any model or sample forms or clauses related to the \naccount-opening disclosures required by \u00a7 226.6(a) at the time a consumer opens a HELOC.\n\nAs discussed above in the section-by-section analysis to \u00a7 226.5b, the Board is proposing to change disclosure \ntiming so that the generic application disclosures required under the current regulation would be replaced with more \ntransaction-specific disclosures to be provided within three business days after a consumer submits a HELOC \napplication (the \"early disclosures\"). In addition, as discussed above, the Board is proposing to substantially revise \nthe format of the disclosures. The application disclosures currently required are subject to few formatting \nrequirements and, in particular, are not required to be in a tabular format or in any minimum font size. Under the \nproposal, the early disclosures would have to be provided in a tabular format, in a minimum font size of 10 points, \nand would be subject to other format requirements.\n\nAccordingly, the Board proposes to replace current Samples G--14A and G--14B and Model G--15 with new model \nand sample forms reflecting the proposed new format requirements. Proposed Models G--14(A) and G--14(B) and \nSamples G--14(C), G--14(D), and G--14(E) would illustrate, in the tabular format, the early disclosures proposed to \nbe required under \u00a7 226.5b. Under proposed \u00a7 226.5b, the early disclosures would have to be given in the form of a \ntable with headings, content, and format substantially similar to any of the applicable models.\n\nProposed Models G--14(A) and G--14(B) differ in that the former provides guidance for creditors that offer two or \nmore HELOC plans, while the latter provides guidance for creditors that offer only one HELOC plan. Proposed \nSamples G--14(C), G--14(D), and G--14(E) differ in that they illustrate differing minimum payment terms, such as \nwhether the HELOC has a repayment period, how the length of the repayment period is determined, whether a \nballoon payment will or may be due, and how the minimum payment amount is calculated during the draw and \nrepayment periods. The proposed samples also differ in that Samples G--14(C) and G--14(E) illustrate plans with \ndiscounted introductory APRs, while Sample G--14(D) illustrates a plan without a discounted introductory APR.\n\nAs discussed above in the section-by-section analysis to \u00a7 226.6, the Board is also proposing to require that certain \naccount-opening disclosures be provided in a tabular format, a minimum font size of 10 points, and subject to other \nformat requirements, similar to the proposed requirements for the early disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.5b. The \ndisclosures that would be required to be provided in tabular format as set forth in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2); account-\nopening disclosures set forth in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(3), (4), and (5), if not listed in proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), would \nnot have to be given in tabular format.\n\nAs mentioned above, Appendix G does not currently contain any model or sample forms or clauses for the account-\nopening disclosures. To provide guidance on the proposed new account-opening disclosure tabular format \nrequirements, the Board proposes to adopt new Model G--15(A) and Samples G--15(B), G--15(C), and G--15(D), \nreflecting those requirements. Under proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(1), specified account-opening disclosures would have to \nbe given in the form of a table with headings, content, and format substantially similar to any of the applicable \nmodels.\n\nThe Board is proposing only one model form for the account-opening disclosures, rather than two forms as in the \ncase of the early disclosures. When the early disclosures are provided soon after application, the consumer may \nnot have chosen a particular HELOC plan, and thus if the creditor offers more than one plan, showing more than \none in the disclosures would be helpful to the consumer and accordingly one of the early disclosure models shows \n\n\n\ntwo plans, as discussed above. In contrast, at the time the HELOC account is opened, the consumer will have \nchosen a particular plan and therefore a second model form is not needed.\n\nProposed Samples G--15(B), G--15(C), and G--15(D), similarly to proposed Samples G--14(C), G--14(D), and G--\n14(E), differ in that they illustrate differing minimum payment terms, such as whether the HELOC has a repayment \nperiod, how the length of the repayment period is determined, whether a balloon payment will or may be due, and \nhow the minimum payment amount is calculated during the draw and repayment periods. The proposed samples \nalso differ with regard to whether the illustrated plan has a discounted introductory APR.\n\nCurrently, the staff commentary to Appendix G does not contain any comments addressing the model and sample \nforms and clauses related to the HELOC disclosures. The Board proposes to add staff commentary to provide \nguidance on the proposed new model and sample forms for the early HELOC disclosures required under proposed \n\u00a7 226.5b(b), as well as on the proposed new model and sample forms for certain account-opening disclosures \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.6(a)(2). The proposed commentary would provide guidance on how to use the model and \nsample forms and on how the various forms differ. In addition, the proposed commentary would provide details on \nthe formatting techniques used in presenting the information in the sample forms, such as on font style and size, \nspacing between lines of text, paragraphs, words, and characters, and sufficient contrast. The commentary would \nalso state that, while the Board would not require creditors to use these formatting techniques (except for the font \nsize requirements), the Board would encourage creditors to consider these techniques when deciding how to \ndisclose information in the table, to ensure that the information is presented in a readable format. This portion of the \nproposed commentary would generally parallel the commentary to the model and sample forms and clauses for \nopen-end (not home-secured) credit adopted in the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule.\n\nModel clauses for notice of results of reinstatement investigation. Model clauses in proposed Models G--22(A) and \nG--22(B) illustrate the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(v). They inform the consumer that the consumer's \nreinstatement request has been received and that the creditor has investigated the request. They contain sample \nlanguage for explaining the results of a reinstatement investigation in which the creditor found that a reason for \nsuspension of advances or reduction of the credit limit still exists. Clauses in Model G--22(A) illustrate how a notice \nmay explain that the same reason or reasons originally supporting the suspension or reduction still exist. Clauses in \nModel G--22(B) illustrate how a creditor may explain that a new reason or reasons for account suspension or \nreduction exist.\n\nModels G--22(A) and G--22(B) do not contain sample clauses for all reasons in which a creditor may temporarily \nsuspend or reduce a home-equity plan; they illustrate only three of the reasons why a creditor may take these \nactions: (1) A significant decline in the value of the property securing the plan (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A)); (2) a material \nchange in the consumer's financial circumstances such that the creditor has a reasonable belief that the consumer \nwill be unable to meet the repayment terms of the plan (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B)); and (3) the consumer's default of a \nmaterial obligation under the plan (\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C)). The Board chose to feature these three reasons for \ntemporary suspension or reduction because Board outreach and research indicated that creditors rely on these \nreasons to take action more often than the reasons found in \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D)-(F), and because they may \npresent more challenges regarding the specificity required to comply with disclosure requirement.\n\nProposed comment 12 to Appendix G of part 226 is intended to affirm that the creditor has flexibility in complying \nwith the disclosure requirement of \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(v). The creditor may comply by using language substantially \nsimilar to the language in the model clauses or by substituting applicable reasons for the action not represented in \nthe model clauses, as long as the information required to be disclosed is clear and conspicuous.\n\nModel clauses for notice of action taken on account. These model clauses illustrate the disclosures required under \n\u00a7 226.9(j)(1) and (j)(3). Clauses in Model G--23(A) contain information required under proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) \nregarding the nature of the action taken on the account under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi) and the specific reasons \nfor the action taken. In particular, they illustrate language for a notice in which the creditor temporarily suspended \nadvances or reduced a credit limit due to a significant decline in the value of the property securing the plan under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A); a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances such that the creditor has a \n\n\n\nreasonable belief that the consumer will be unable to meet the repayment terms of the plan under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B); and the consumer's default of a material obligation under the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C). \nAgain, the Board chose to feature these three reasons for temporary suspension or reduction because Board \noutreach and research indicated that creditors rely on these reasons to take action more often than the reasons \nfound in \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D)-(F), and because they may present more challenges regarding the specificity required \nto comply with the disclosure requirement. Model G--23(A) clauses also contain information regarding the \nconsumer's rights when the creditor requires the consumer to request reinstatement under \u00a7 226.5b(g)(1)(ii).\n\nClauses in Model G--23(B) contain information required under proposed \u00a7 226.9(j)(3) regarding the nature of the \naction taken on the account under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) and the specific reasons for the action taken. In particular, they \nillustrate language for a notice in which the creditor takes action on an account due to the consumer's failure to \nmake a required minimum periodic payment within 30 days of the due date under proposed \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii) and \nthe consumer's action or inaction that adversely affected the creditor's interest in the property securing the plan \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iii). Model clauses for the notice when a creditor takes action due to a consumer's fraud or \nmaterial misrepresentation under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(i) are not included because, under proposed comment 9(j)(3)-2.ii, a \ncreditor need disclose only that the consumer's fraud or misrepresentation is the reason for the action.\n\nProposed comment 13 to Appendix G is intended to affirm that a creditor has flexibility in complying with the \ndisclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) and (j)(3). The creditor may comply by using language substantially similar \nto the language in the model clauses or by substituting applicable reasons for the action not represented in the \nmodel clauses, as long as the information required to be disclosed is clear and conspicuous.\n\nThe Board developed the clauses in proposed Models G--22(A), G--22(B), G--23(A) and G--23(B) in consultation \nwith ICF Macro, a third-party consumer research and testing firm contracted by the Board to assist with developing \nand testing disclosures for home-equity plans. The Board has not yet tested the clauses in proposed Models G--\n22(A), G--22(B), G--23(A) and G--23(B) with consumers. The Board requests comment on whether consumer \ntesting of these clauses is necessary, whether the Board should develop model forms rather than model clauses for \nthe disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(v) and \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) and (j)(3), and whether the Board should consider \nmodifying, deleting, or adding any proposed clauses for these models.\n\nSample forms for periodic statements, change-in-terms notices, and notices of rate increases. As discussed above \nin the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.7(a), the Board is proposing to revise the requirements for \ndisclosures on periodic statements for HELOC accounts. Periodic statements would be subject to certain content \nand formatting requirements, including a requirement to disclose a total of interest and a total of fees charged, both \nfor the statement period and for year to date, in proximity to the list of transactions on the statement. To provide \nguidance on the proposed periodic statement requirements, the Board proposes to adopt new Samples G--24(A), \nG--24(B), and G--24(C). Under proposed \u00a7 226.7(a), the interest and fee disclosures would have to be made using \na format substantially similar to the samples. Proposed Sample G--24(A) illustrates the disclosure of total interest \nand total fees for the period and year to date in proximity to transactions. Proposed Samples G--24(B) and G--24(C) \nshow entire periodic statements, including the grouping shown in Sample G--24(A) as well as other elements of \nthe statements.\n\nAs discussed above in the section-by-section analysis to proposed \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) and (i), the Board is also proposing \nto revise the requirements for providing change-in-terms notices for HELOCs, and to adopt a new requirement to \nprovide a notice of rate increase. The notice would be subject to certain formatting requirements including the use \nof a tabular format, and if the notice is given with a periodic statement, would have to be disclosed on the front of \nany page of the statement. If the notice is not given with a periodic statement, the notice would have to be \ndisclosed, at the creditor's option, on the front of the first page or segregated on a separate page from other \ninformation. The Board proposes to adopt new Sample G--25, illustrating a change-in-terms notice using the tabular \nformat, and Sample G--26, showing a notice of rate increase using the tabular format. Proposed Sample G--24(C) \nillustrates a change-in-terms notice given on the front of a periodic statement using the tabular format, and \nproposed Sample G--24(B) provides the same guidance with regard to a notice of rate increase.\n\n\n\nThe Board also proposes to adopt staff commentary to provide guidance on the use of proposed Samples G--24(A), \nG--24(B), G--24(C), G--25, and G--26. The proposed commentary would discuss how the forms may be used and \nhow they differ from each other. In addition, the commentary would make clear that the samples contain \ninformation that is not required by Regulation Z, and that they present information in additional formats that are not \nrequired by Regulation Z.\n\nModel and sample forms for credit insurance, debt cancellation or debt suspension. As discussed in the notice of \nthe Board's proposal regarding closed-end mortgage lending requirements under Regulation Z, published today \nelsewhere in this Federal Register, the Board is proposing certain additional disclosure requirements relating to \ncredit insurance, debt cancellation or debt suspension. Generally, the proposed disclosures would enhance \ninformation provided to consumers about the optional nature of the insurance or coverage, the cost, and eligibility \nrequirements. The Board is proposing to adopt new samples and models for these disclosures, designated G--\n16(C) and G--16(D) for open-end credit and H-17(C) and H-17(D) for closed-end credit. For the proposed text of the \nsample and model disclosures and for further discussion of them, refer to the Board's separate Federal Register \nnotice published today elsewhere in this Federal Register.\n\nVII. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\nIn accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 CFR Part 1320 Appendix A.1), \nthe Board reviewed the proposed rule under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB). The collection of information that is required by this proposed rule is found in 12 CFR part 226. The \nBoard may not conduct or sponsor, and an organization is not required to respond to, this information collection \nunless the information collection displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control number is 7100-\n0199.\n\nThis information collection is required to provide benefits for consumers and is mandatory (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). \nSince the Board does not collect any information, no issue of confidentiality arises. The respondents/ recordkeepers \nare creditors and other entities subject to Regulation Z.\n\nTILA and Regulation Z are intended to ensure effective disclosure of the costs and terms of credit to consumers. \nFor open-end credit, creditors are required to, among other things, disclose information about the initial costs and \nterms and to provide periodic statements of account activity, notice of changes in terms, and statements of rights \nconcerning billing error procedures. Regulation Z requires specific types of disclosures for credit and charge card \naccounts and home equity plans. For closed-end loans, such as mortgage and installment loans, cost disclosures \nare required to be provided prior to consummation. Special disclosures are required in connection with certain \nproducts, such as reverse mortgages, certain variable-rate loans, and certain mortgages with rates and fees above \nspecified thresholds. TILA and Regulation Z also contain rules concerning credit advertising. Creditors are required \nto retain evidence of compliance for twenty-four months, \u00a7 226.25, for certain types of records. 41\n\nUnder the PRA, the Board accounts for the paperwork burden associated with Regulation Z for the state member \nbanks and other creditors supervised by the Board that engage in consumer credit activities covered by Regulation \nZ and, therefore, are respondents under the PRA. Appendix I of Regulation Z defines the Federal Reserve-\nregulated institutions as: State member banks, branches and agencies of foreign banks (other than federal \nbranches, federal agencies, and insured state branches of foreign banks), commercial lending companies owned or \ncontrolled by foreign banks, and organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve Act. Other \n\n41 See comments 25(a)-3 and - 4.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nfederal agencies account for the paperwork burden imposed on the entities for which they have administrative \nenforcement authority. The current total annual burden to comply with the provisions of Regulation Z is estimated to \nbe 734,127 hours for the 1,138 Federal Reserve-regulated institutions that are deemed to be respondents for the \npurposes of the PRA. To ease the burden and cost of complying with Regulation Z (particularly for small entities), \nthe Board provides model forms, which are appended to the regulation.\n\nAs discussed in the preamble, the Board is proposing changes to format, timing, and content requirements for \nHELOC disclosures required by Regulation Z: (1) Educational information published by the Board provided at \napplication; (2) transaction-specific disclosures provided within three days after application; (3) transaction-specific \ndisclosures provided at account-opening; (4) periodic statements and notices of changes to the transaction's terms \nprovided during the life of the plan; and (5) notices related to terminating, suspending, and reinstating accounts, and \nreducing the credit limit. The proposed rule would impose a one-time increase in the total annual burden under \nRegulation Z for all respondents regulated by the Federal Reserve by 104,160 hours, from 734,127 to 838,287 \nhours. In addition, the Board estimates that, on a continuing basis, the proposed revisions to the rules would \nincrease the total annual burden on a continuing basis from 734,127 to 1,323,049 hours.\n\nThe total estimated burden increase, as well as the estimates of the burden increase associated with each major \nsection of the proposed rule as set forth below, represents averages for all respondents regulated by the Federal \nReserve. The Board expects that the amount of time required to implement each of the proposed changes for a \ngiven institution may vary based on the size and complexity of the respondent. Furthermore, the burden estimate \nfor this rulemaking does not include the burden of complying with proposed disclosure and timing requirements that \napply to private educational lenders making private education loans as announced in a separate proposed \nrulemaking (Docket No. R-1353) or the proposed disclosure and timing requirements of the Board's separate notice \npublished simultaneously with this proposal for closed-end mortgages.\n\nThe Board estimates that 651 respondents regulated by the Federal Reserve would take, on average, 160 hours \n(four business weeks) to update their systems, internal procedure manuals, and provide training for relevant staff to \ncomply with the proposed disclosure requirements in \u00a7 226.5b(b). This one-time revision would increase the burden \nby 104,160 hours. On a continuing basis the Board estimates that 651 respondents regulated by the Federal \nReserve would take, on average, 64 hours a month to comply with the all of the disclosure requirements for open-\nend credit plans secured by real property and would increase the ongoing burden from 15,532 hours to 500,294 \nhours. To ease the burden and cost of complying with the new and proposed requirements under Regulation Z the \nBoard proposes to revise or add several model forms, model clauses and sample forms to Appendix G.\n\nThe other federal financial agencies: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Office of Thrift Supervision \n(OTS), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) \nare responsible for estimating and reporting to OMB the total paperwork burden for the domestically chartered \ncommercial banks, thrifts, and federal credit unions and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks for which they \nhave primary administrative enforcement jurisdiction under TILA Section 108(a), 15 U.S.C. 1607(a). These \nagencies may, but are not required to, use the Board's burden estimation methodology. Using the Board's method, \nthe total current estimated annual burden for the approximately 17,200 domestically chartered commercial banks, \nthrifts, and federal credit unions and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks supervised by the Federal \nReserve, OCC, OTS, FDIC, and NCUA under TILA would be approximately 13,568,725 hours. The proposed rule \nwould impose a one-time increase in the estimated annual burden for such institutions by 2,752,000 hours to \n16,320,725 hours. On a continuing basis the proposed rule would impose an increase in the estimated annual \nburden by 13,209,600 to 26,778,325 hours. The above estimates represent an average across all respondents; the \nBoard expects variations between institutions based on their size, complexity, and practices.\n\nComments are invited on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper \nperformance of the Federal Reserve's functions; including whether the information has practical utility; (2) the \naccuracy of the Federal Reserve's estimate of the burden of the proposed information collection, including the cost \nof compliance; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to \nminimize the burden of information collection on respondents, including through the use of automated collection \n\n\n\ntechniques or other forms of information technology. Comments on the collection of information should be sent to \nCynthia Ayouch, Acting Federal Reserve Board Clearance Officer, Division of Research and Statistics, Mail Stop \n95-A, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, with copies of such comments \nsent to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (7100-0199), Washington, DC 20503.\n\nVIII. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n\nIn accordance with section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, the Board is publishing an \ninitial regulatory flexibility analysis for the proposed amendments to Regulation Z. The RFA requires an agency \neither to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with a proposed rule or to certify that the proposed rule will \nnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Under regulations issued by the \nSmall Business Administration, an entity is considered \"small\" if it has $ 175 million or less in assets for banks and \nother depository institutions; and $ 7 million or less in revenues for non-depository lenders and loan originators. 42\n\nBased on its analysis and for the reasons stated below, the Board believes that the proposed rule will have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A final regulatory flexibility analysis will be \nconducted after consideration of comments received during the public comment period. The Board requests public \ncomment in the following areas.\n\nA. Reasons for the Proposed Rule\n\nCongress enacted TILA based on findings that economic stability would be enhanced and competition among \nconsumer credit providers would be strengthened by the informed use of credit resulting from consumers' \nawareness of the cost of credit. One of the stated purposes of TILA is to provide a meaningful disclosure of credit \nterms to enable consumers to compare credit terms available in the marketplace more readily and avoid the \nuninformed use of credit. In this regard, the goal of the proposed amendments to Regulation Z is to improve the \neffectiveness of the disclosures that creditors provide to consumers beginning before application and throughout \nthe life of a HELOC plan. Accordingly, the Board is proposing changes to format, timing, and content requirements \nfor HELOC disclosures required by Regulation Z: (1) Educational information published by the Board provided with \nthe application; (2) transaction-specific disclosures provided shortly after application; (3) transaction-specific \ndisclosures provided at account-opening; (4) periodic statements and notices of changes to the transaction's terms \nprovided during the life of the plan; and (5) notices related to terminating, suspending, and reinstating accounts, and \nreducing the credit limit.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed regulations would revise and enhance the content of HELOC disclosures currently \nrequired at application and account-opening, as well as periodic statements and change-in-terms notices. The \nBoard's proposal also would require creditors to provide transaction-specific disclosures early enough in the \nprocess (i.e., within three business days after application rather than at account-opening, as currently required) to \nenable consumers to make decisions based on credit terms that would be offered to them and not on general \ninformation that may not apply to a particular consumer. The Board's proposal also would revise notice of action \ntaken requirements for accounts that are temporarily suspended or reduced; require a notice of action taken when a \ncreditor takes any action for reasons that would allow the creditor to terminate the account; and require a notice of \nthe results of a creditor's investigation of a consumer's request for reinstatement of credit privileges on accounts \n\n42 13 CFR 121.201.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nthat have been temporarily suspended or reduced. These amendments are proposed in furtherance of the Board's \nresponsibility to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of TILA, including promoting consumers' awareness \nof the cost of credit and their informed use of credit.\n\nB. Statement of Objectives and Legal Basis\n\nThe SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION contains information about objectives of and legal basis for the proposed \nrule. In summary, the proposed amendments to Regulation Z are designed to achieve two goals: (1) Revise \ncontent, timing and format of disclosures required for HELOCs at application, account-opening, and after the \nHELOC is opened; and (2) clarify and strengthen certain substantive restrictions on when creditors may change the \nterms of a HELOC plan, including when a creditor may terminate, suspend, or reduce a HELOC.\n\nThe legal basis for the proposed rule is in Sections 105(a), 105(f), 127(a)(8), 127A(a)(14) and 127A(e) of TILA. 15 \nU.S.C. 1604(a), 1604(f), 1637(a)(8), 1637a(a)(14), and 1637a(e). A more detailed discussion of the Board's \nrulemaking authority is set forth in part IV of the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.\n\nC. Description of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rule Would Apply\n\nThe proposed regulations would apply to all institutions and entities that engage in originating or extending \nHELOCs. The Board is not aware of a reliable source for the total number of small entities likely to be affected by \nthe proposal; and the credit provisions of TILA and Regulation Z have broad applicability to individuals and \nbusinesses that originate, extend and service even small numbers of home-secured credit. See \u00a7 226.1(c)(1). 43 \nThus, all small entities that originate, extend, or service HELOCs potentially could be subject to at least some \naspects of the proposed rule.\n\nThe Board can, however, identify through data from Reports of Condition and Income (\"call reports\") approximate \nnumbers of small depository institutions that would be subject to the proposed rules if they originate or extend \nHELOCs. Based on December 2008 call report data, approximately 7,557 small institutions would be subject to the \nproposed rule. Approximately 16,345 depository institutions in the United States filed call report data, approximately \n11,907 of which had total domestic assets of $ 175 million or less and thus were considered small entities for \npurposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Of 4,231 banks, 565 thrifts and 7,111 credit unions that filed call report \ndata and were considered small entities, 2,397 banks, 363 thrifts, and 4,797 credit unions, totaling 7,557 \ninstitutions, extended HELOCs. For purposes of this analysis, thrifts include savings banks, savings and loan \nentities, co-operative banks and industrial banks.\n\nThe Board cannot identify with certainty the number of small non-depository institutions that would be subject to the \nproposed rule. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) 44 data indicate that 1,752 non-depository institutions filed \n\n43 Regulation Z generally applies to \"each individual or business that offers or extends credit when four conditions are met: (i) \nThe credit is offered or extended toconsumers; (ii) the offering or extension of credit is done regularly, (iii) the credit is subject to \na finance charge or is payable by a written agreement in more than four installments, and (iv) the credit is primarily for personal, \nfamily, or household purposes.\" \u00a7 226.1(c)(1).\n\n \n\n \n\n44 The 8,610 lenders (both depository institutions andmortgage companies) covered by HMDA in 2007 accounted for an \nestimated 80% of all home lending in the United States (2008 HMDA data are not yet available). Under HMDA, lenders use a \n\"loan/application register\" (HMDA/LAR) to report information annually to their federal supervisory agencies for each application \nand loan acted on during the calendar year. Lenders must make their HMDA/LARs available to the public by March 31 following \n\n\n\nHMDA reports in 2007. 45 Based on the small volume of lending activity reported by these institutions in general, \nmost are likely to be small. 46\n\nAnother aspect of the Board's proposal that would affect individuals and small entities that are non-depositories is \nthe requirement that creditors disclose as part of the early HELOC disclosure the identity of the creditor making the \ndisclosures and the loan originator's unique identifier, as defined by the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage \nLicensing Act of 2008 (\"SAFE Act\") Sections 1503(3) and (12), 12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12). 15 U.S.C. \n1637a(a)(14). Currently, a creditor is not required to disclose identification information about the creditor and the \nborrower as part of the application disclosures. Loan originators other than brokers that would be affected by the \nproposal are employees of creditors (or of brokers) and, as such, are not business entities in their own right. In its \n2008 proposed rule under HOEPA, 73 FR 1672, 1720 (Jan. 9, 2008), the Board noted that, according to the \nNational Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB), in 2004 there were 53,000 brokerage companies that employed \nan estimated 418,700 people. 47 The Board estimated that most of these companies are small entities. In addition, \na comment letter received from the U.S. Small Business Administration under the Board's 2008 HOEPA proposal \ncited the U.S. Census Bureau's 2002 Economic Census in stating that there were 15,195 small broker entities.\n\nD. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements\n\nThe compliance requirements of the proposed rules are described in parts II, V and VI of the SUPPLEMENTARY \nINFORMATION. The exact effect of the proposed revisions to Regulation Z on small entities is unknown. Some \nsmall entities would be required, among other things, to modify their HELOC disclosures and disclosure delivery \nprocess to comply with the revised rules. The precise costs to small entities of updating their systems and \ndisclosures are difficult to predict. These costs will depend on a number of unknown factors, including, among other \nthings, the specifications of the current systems used by such entities to prepare and provide disclosures and to \nadminister and maintain accounts, the complexity of the terms of HELOCs that they offer, and the range of their \nHELOC product offerings.\n\nE. Identification of Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules\n\nOther Federal Rules\n\nthe year to which the data relate, and they must remove the two date-related fields to help preserve applicants' privacy. Only \nlenders that have offices (or, for non-depository institutions, are deemed to have offices) in metropolitan areas are required to \nreport under HMDA. However, if a lender is required to report, it must report information on all of its home loan applications and \nloans in all locations, including non-metropolitan areas.\n\n45 The 2007 HMDA Data, http:// www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2008/articles/hmda/default.htm .\n\n46 The Board recognizes that reporting HELOC originations under HMDA is optional, so HMDA reporting is not an exact gauge of \nsmall non-depositories engaging in HELOC lending.\n\n \n\n \n\n47 http://www.namb.org/namb/Industry_Facts.asp?SnID=719224934 . The cited page of the NAMB Web site, however, no longer \nprovides an estimate of the number of mortgage brokerage companies.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2008/articles/hmda/default.htm\nhttp://www.namb.org/namb/Industry_Facts.asp?SnID=719224934\n\n\nThe Board has not identified any federal rules that conflict with the proposed revisions to Regulation Z.\n\nOverlap With SAFE Act\n\nThe proposed rule's required disclosure contents for HELOCs would overlap with the SAFE Act by requiring that the \ndisclosure include the loan originator's unique identifier, as defined by SAFE Act, if applicable.\n\nF. Identification of Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting State Laws\n\nState Laws Requiring Loan Originator's Unique Identifier\n\nThe Board is aware that many states regulate loan originators, especially brokers. Under TILA Section 111, the \nproposed rule would not preempt such state laws except to the extent they are inconsistent with the proposal's \nrequirements. 15 U.S.C. 1610.\n\nState TILA Equivalents\n\nMany states regulate consumer credit through statutory disclosure schemes similar to TILA (\"TILA equivalents\"). \nSimilarly to state laws regulating loan originators, such state TILA equivalents would be preempted only to the \nextent they are inconsistent with the proposal's requirements. Id.\n\nThe Board seeks comment regarding any state or local statutes or regulations that would duplicate, overlap, or \nconflict with the proposed rule.\n\nG. Discussion of Significant Alternatives\n\nThe Board welcomes comments on any significant alternatives, consistent with the requirements of TILA, that would \nminimize the impact of the proposed rule on small entities.\n\nText of Proposed Revisions\n\nCertain conventions have been used to highlight the proposed revisions. New language is shown inside arrows \nwhile language that would be deleted is set off with brackets. In certain cases deemed appropriate by the Board to \naid understanding, redesignated text, such as text moved from the commentary into the regulation or from one \nparagraph to another, reflects changes to the original text, with arrows and brackets.\n\nList of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 226\n\nAdvertising, Consumer protection, Federal Reserve System, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Truth in lending.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposes to amend Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, as set forth \nbelow:\n\nPART 226--TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)\n\n1. The authority citation for part 226 continues to read as follows:\n\n\n\nAuthority: 12 U.S.C. 3806; 15 U.S.C. 1604, and 1637(c)(5).\n\nSubpart A--General\n\n2. Section 226.2 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(6) to read as follows:\n\n\u00a7 226.2 Definitions and rules of construction.\n\n(a) * * *\n\n(6) Business Day means a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all \nof its business functions. However, for purposes of rescission under \u00a7\u00a7 226.15 and 226.23, and for purposes of \u00a7 \n226.5b(e), \u00a7 226.9(j)(2), \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(ii), \u00a7 226.19(a)(2), and \u00a7 226.31, the term means all calendar days except \nSundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a), such as New Year's Day, the Birthday of \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, \nVeterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.\n\n* * * *\n\nSubpart B--Open-End Credit\n\n3. Section 226.5 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1), (b)(4), and (c), and by republishing \nparagraph (d) to read as follows:\n\n\u00a7 226.5 General disclosure requirements.\n\n(a) Form of disclosures--(1) General.\n\n(i) The creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously.\n\n(ii) The creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart in writing, 7 in a form that the consumer may \nkeep, 8 except that:\n\n(A) The following disclosures need not be written:\n\n(1) Disclosures under \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) of charges that are imposed as part of a home-equity plan that are not required \nto be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) and related disclosures under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(ii)(B) of charges;\n\n(2) Disclosures under \u00a7 226.6(b)(3) of charges that are imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan \nthat are not required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(b)(2) and related disclosures under \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(ii)(B) of \ncharges;\n\n(3) Disclosures [disclosures] under \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(v); and\n\n7 [Reserved].\n\n8 [Reserved].\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n(4) Disclosures [disclosures] under \u00a7 226.9(d) when a finance charge is imposed at the time of the transaction.\n\n(B) The following disclosures need not be in a retainable form:\n\n(1) Disclosures that need not be written under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section;\n\n(2) Disclosures [disclosures] for credit and charge card applications and solicitations under \u00a7 226.5a; [home-equity \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(d)];\n\n(3) The [the] alternative summary billing-rights statement under \u00a7 226.9(a)(2);\n\n(4) The [the] credit and charge card renewal disclosures required under \u00a7 226.9(e); and\n\n(5) The [the] payment requirements under \u00a7 226.10(b), except as provided in \u00a7 226.7(b)(13).\n\n(iii) The disclosures required by this subpart may be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to \ncompliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and \nNational Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). The disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a, 226.5b(a), \nand 226.16 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent or other \nprovisions of the E-Sign Act in the circumstances set forth in those sections.\n\n(2) Terminology. (i) Terminology used in providing the disclosures required by this subpart shall be consistent.\n\n(ii) If disclosures are required to be presented in a tabular format pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the \nterms borrowing period (in reference to the draw period), repayment period, and balloon payment shall be used, as \napplicable. If credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required as part of the plan, the \nterm required shall be used and the program shall be identified by its name. [For home-equity plans subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b, the terms finance charge and annual percentage rate, when required to be disclosed with a corresponding \namount or percentage rate, shall be more conspicuous than any other required disclosure. 9 The terms need not be \nmore conspicuous when used for periodic statement disclosures under \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) and for advertisements under \n\u00a7 226.16.]\n\n(iii) If disclosures are required to be presented in a tabular format pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(except for paragraph \n(a)(3)(ii) and the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) that must be presented in a tabular format pursuant to \nparagraph (a)(3)(iii)) of this section, the term penalty APR shall be used, as applicable. The term penalty APR need \nnot be used in reference to the annual percentage rate that applies with the loss of a promotional rate, assuming \nthe annual percentage rate that applies is not greater than the annual percentage rate that would have applied at \nthe end of the promotional period; or if the annual percentage rate that applies with the loss of a promotional rate is \na variable rate, the annual percentage rate is calculated using the same index and margin as would have been \nused to calculate the annual percentage rate that would have applied at the end of the promotional period. If credit \ninsurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required as part of the plan, the term required shall \nbe used and the program shall be identified by its name. If an annual percentage rate is required to be presented in \na tabular format pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(iii) (except for the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) \nthat must be presented in a tabular format pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii)) of this section), the term fixed, or a \nsimilar term, may not be used to describe such rate unless the creditor also specifies a time period that the rate will \nbe fixed and the rate will not increase during that period, or if no such time period is provided, the rate will not \nincrease while the plan is open.\n\n9 [Reserved].\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n(3) Specific formats. (i) Certain disclosures for credit and charge card applications and solicitations must be \nprovided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 226.5a(a)(2).\n\n(ii) Certain disclosures for home-equity plans [must precede other disclosures and] must be [given] provided in a \ntabular format in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b[(a)](b)(2).\n\n(iii) Certain account-opening disclosures must be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements \nof \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (b)(1).\n\n(iv) Certain disclosures provided on periodic statements must be grouped together in accordance with the \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.7(a)(6), (b)(6) and (b)(13).\n\n(v) Certain disclosures accompanying checks that access a credit card account must be provided in a tabular \nformat in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 226.9(b)(3).\n\n(vi) Certain disclosures provided in a change-in-terms notice must be provided in a tabular format in accordance \nwith the requirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B) and (c)(2)(iii)(B).\n\n(vii) Certain disclosures provided when a rate is increased due to delinquency, default or as a penalty must be \nprovided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(ii)and (i)(4).\n\n* * * *\n\n(b) Time of disclosures--(1) Account-opening disclosures--(i) General rule. The creditor shall furnish account-\nopening disclosures required by \u00a7 226.6 before the first transaction is made under the plan.\n\n(ii) Charges imposed as part of an open-end [(not home-secured)] plan. Charges that are imposed as part of an \nopen-end [(not home-secured)] plan and are not required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) or (b)(2) may be \ndisclosed after account opening but before the consumer agrees to pay or becomes obligated to pay for the charge, \nprovided they are disclosed at a time and in a manner such that a consumer would be likely to notice them. [This \nprovision does not apply to charges imposed as part of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b.]\n\n(iii) Telephone purchases. Disclosures required by \u00a7 226.6 may be provided as soon as reasonably practicable after \nthe first transaction if:\n\n(A) The first transaction occurs when a consumer contacts a merchant by telephone to purchase goods and at the \nsame time the consumer accepts an offer to finance the purchase by establishing an open-end plan with the \nmerchant or third-party creditor;\n\n(B) The merchant or third-party creditor permits consumers to return any goods financed under the plan and \nprovides consumers with a sufficient time to reject the plan and return the goods free of cost after the merchant or \nthird-party creditor has provided the written disclosures required by \u00a7 226.6; and\n\n(C) The consumer's right to reject the plan and return the goods is disclosed to the consumer as a part of the offer \nto finance the purchase.\n\n(iv) Membership fees--(A) General. In general, a creditor may not collect any fee before account-opening \ndisclosures are provided. A creditor may collect, or obtain the consumer's agreement to pay, membership fees, \nincluding application fees excludable from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(1), before providing account-\nopening disclosures if, after receiving the disclosures, the consumer may reject the plan and have no obligation to \npay these fees (including application fees) or any other fee or charge. A membership fee for purposes of this \nparagraph has the same meaning as a fee for the issuance or availability of credit described in \u00a7 226.5a(b)(2). If the \nconsumer rejects the plan, the creditor must promptly refund the membership fee if it has been paid, or take other \naction necessary to ensure the consumer is not obligated to pay that fee or any other fee or charge.\n\n\n\n(B) Home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b are not subject \nto the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section. (See \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(d), 226.5b(e), and 226.15 regarding \nrequirements for refunds of fees applicable to creditors offering home-equity plans.)\n\n(v) Application fees. (A) General. In general, a [A] creditor may collect an application fee excludable from the \nfinance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(1) before providing account-opening disclosures. However, if a consumer rejects \nthe plan after receiving account-opening disclosures, the consumer must have no obligation to pay such an \napplication fee, or if the fee was paid, it must be refunded. See \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(iv).\n\n(B) Home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b are not subject \nto the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section. (See \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(d), 226.5b(e), and 226.15 regarding \nrequirements for refunds of fees applicable to creditors offering home-equity plans.)\n\n* * * *\n\n(4) Home-equity plan[s] application and three days after application disclosures. Disclosures for home-equity plans \nshall be made in accordance with the timing requirements of \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) and (b)(1).\n\n(c) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates. Disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the \nparties. If any information necessary for accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor, the creditor [it] shall make \nthe disclosure based on the best information reasonably available and shall state clearly that the disclosure is an \nestimate.\n\n(d) Multiple creditors; multiple consumers. If the credit plan involves more than one creditor, only one set of \ndisclosures shall be given, and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor must comply with the \nrequirements that this regulation imposes on any or all of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures \nmay be made to any consumer who is primarily liable on the account. If the right of rescission under \u00a7 226.15 is \napplicable, however, the disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.6 and 226.15(b) shall be made to each consumer having \nthe right to rescind.\n\n* * * *\n\n4. Section 226.5b is amended by revising paragraphs (a) through (e), (f)(2)(ii), (f)(2)(iv), and (f)(3)(vi)(A), adding \nnew paragraphs (f)(3)(vi)(G), and (g), and revising and redesignating current paragraph (g) as paragraph (d) and \ncurrent paragraph (h) as paragraph (e) as follows:\n\n\u00a7 226.5b Requirements for home-equity plans.\n\nThe requirements of this section apply to open-end credit plans secured by the consumer's dwelling. [For purposes \nof this section, an annual percentage rate is the annual percentage rate corresponding to the periodic rate as \ndetermined under section 226.14(b).]\n\n(a) Home-equity document provided on or with the application--(1) In general. (i) Except as provided in paragraph \n(a)(1)(ii) of this section, the home-equity document \"Key Questions to Ask about Home Equity Lines of Credit\" \npublished by the Board shall be provided at the time an application is provided to the consumer. The document \nmust be provided in a prominent location on or with an application.\n\n(ii) For telephone applications or applications received through an intermediary agent or broker, the document \nrequired by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section must be delivered or mailed not later than account opening or three \nbusiness days following receipt of a consumer's application by the creditor, whichever is earlier, with the disclosures \nrequired by paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(2) Electronic disclosure. For an application that is accessed by the consumer in electronic form, the document \nrequired by paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be provided to the consumer in electronic form on or with the \napplication.\n\n\n\n(3) Duties of third parties. Persons other than the creditor who provide applications to consumers for home-equity \nplans must comply with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, except that these third parties are not required \nto deliver or mail the document required by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for telephone applications as \ndiscussed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. 10a\n\n(b) Home-equity disclosures provided no later than account opening or three business days after application, \nwhichever is earlier--(1) Timing. The disclosures required by paragraph (c) of this section shall be delivered or \nmailed not later than account opening, or three business days following receipt of a consumer's application by the \ncreditor, whichever is earlier.\n\n(2) Form of disclosures; tabular format. (i) The disclosures required by paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(19) of this \nsection generally shall be in the form of a table with headings, content, and format substantially similar to any of the \napplicable tables found in G--14 in Appendix G to this part.\n\n(ii) The table described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall contain only the information required or permitted \nby paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(19).\n\n(iii) Disclosures required by paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this section must be placed directly above the table \ndescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, in a format substantially similar to any of the applicable tables found \nin G--14 in Appendix G to this part.\n\n(iv) The disclosures required by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(4)(i), (c)(20) through (c)(22) of this section must be disclosed \ndirectly below the table described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, in a format substantially similar to any of the \napplicable tables found in G--14 in Appendix G to this part.\n\n(v) Other information may be presented with the table described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, provided that \nsuch information appears outside of the required table.\n\n(vi) The following disclosures must be disclosed in bold text:\n\n(A) Disclosures required by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(4)(i), (c)(20), (c)(21), and (c)(22)(i) of this section.\n\n(B) Any annual percentage rates required to be disclosed under paragraph (c)(10) of this section.\n\n(C) Total account opening fees disclosed under paragraph (c)(11) of this section.\n\n(D) Any percentage or dollar amount required to be disclosed under paragraphs (c)(12), (c)(13), (c)(16), (c)(17) and \n(c)(19) of this section, except the amount of any periodic fee disclosed pursuant to paragraph (c)(12) of this section \nthat is not an annualized amount.\n\n(E) If a creditor is required under paragraph (c)(9) of this section to provide a disclosure in a format substantially \nsimilar to the format used in any of the applicable tables found in Samples G--14(C), 14(D) and 14(E) in Appendix G \nto this part, the creditor must provide in bold text any terms and phrases that are shown in bold text for that \ndisclosure in the applicable tables.\n\n(3) Disclosures based on a percentage. Except for disclosing fees under paragraph (c)(11) of this section, if the \namount of any fee required to be disclosed under paragraph (c) of this section or if the amount of any transaction \n\n10a [Reserved].\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nrequirement required to be disclosed under paragraph (c)(16) of this section is determined on the basis of a \npercentage of another amount, the percentage used and the identification of the amount against which the \npercentage is applied may be disclosed instead of the amount of the fee or transaction amount, as applicable.\n\n[(a) Form of disclosures--(1) General. The disclosures required by paragraph (d) of this section shall be made \nclearly and conspicuously and shall be grouped together and segregated from all unrelated information. The \ndisclosures may be provided on the application form or on a separate form. The disclosure described in paragraph \n(d)(4)(iii), the itemization of third-party fees described in paragraph (d)(8), and the variable-rate information \ndescribed in paragraph (d)(12) of this section may be provided separately from the other required disclosures.\n\n(2) Precedence of certain disclosures. The disclosures described in paragraph (d)(1) through (4)(ii) of this section \nshall precede the other required disclosures.\n\n(3) For an application that is accessed by the consumer in electronic form, the disclosures required under this \nsection may be provided to the consumer in electronic form on or with the application.\n\n(b) Time of disclosures. The disclosures and brochure required by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be \nprovided at the time an application is provided to the consumer. 10a\n\n(c) Duties of third parties--Persons other than the creditor who provide applications to consumers for home-equity \nplans must provide the brochure required under paragraph (e) of this section at the time an application is provided. \nIf such persons have the disclosures required under paragraph (d) of this section for a creditor's home-equity plan, \nthey also shall provide the disclosures at such time. n10a]\n\n[(d)](c) Content of disclosures. The creditor shall provide the following disclosures in the manner prescribed by \nparagraph (b) of this section, as applicable. In making the disclosures required by this paragraph (except under \nparagraph (c)(18) of this section), a creditor must not disclose in the table described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this \nsection any terms applicable to fixed-rate and-term payment plans offered during the draw period of the plan, \nunless fixed-rate and-term payment plans are the only payment plans offered during the draw period of the plan.\n\n(1) Identification information.\n\n(i) The consumer's name and address.\n\n(ii) The identity of the creditor making the disclosures.\n\n(iii) The date the disclosure was prepared.\n\n(iv) The loan originator's unique identifier, as defined by the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing \nAct of 2008 Sections 1503(3) and (12), 12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12). [(1) Retention of information. A statement that \nthe consumer should make or otherwise retain a copy of the disclosures.]\n\n(2) No obligation statement.

Section 226.14 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\u00a7 226.14 Determination of annual percentage rate.\n\n(a) General rule. The annual percentage rate is a measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate. An \nannual percentage rate shall be considered accurate if it is not more than 1/8th of 1 percentage point above or \nbelow the annual percentage rate determined in accordance with this section. 31a An error in disclosure of the \nannual percentage rate or finance charge shall not, in itself, be considered a violation of this regulation if:\n\n(1) The error resulted from a corresponding error in a calculation tool used in good faith by the creditor; and\n\n(2) Upon discovery of the error, the creditor promptly discontinues use of that calculation tool for disclosure \npurposes, and notifies the Board in writing of the error in the calculation tool.\n\n(b) Annual percentage rate--in general. Where one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance \ncharge, the annual percentage rate(s) to be disclosed for purposes of subpart B of this regulation [\u00a7\u00a7 226.5a, \n226.5b, 226.6, 226.7(a)(4) or (b)(4), 226.9, 226.15, 226.16, and 226.26] shall be computed by multiplying each \nperiodic rate by the number of periods in a year.\n\n[(c) Optional effective annual percentage rate for periodic statements for creditors offering open-end plans subject \nto the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b. A creditor offering an open-end plan subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b need \nnot disclose an effective annual percentage rate. Such a creditor may, at its option, disclose an effective annual \npercentage rate(s) pursuant to \u00a7 226.7(a)(7) and compute the effective annual percentage rate as follows:\n\n(1) Solely periodic rates imposed. If the finance charge is determined solely by applying one or more periodic rates, \nat the creditor's option, either:\n\n(i) By multiplying each periodic rate by the number of periods in a year; or\n\n(ii) By dividing the total finance charge for the billing cycle by the sum of the balances to which the periodic rates \nwere applied and multiplying the quotient (expressed as a percentage) by the number of billing cycles in a year.\n\n(2) Minimum or fixed charge, but not transaction charge, imposed. If the finance charge imposed during the billing \ncycle is or includes a minimum, fixed, or other charge not due to the application of a periodic rate, other than a \n\n31a [Reserved].\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ncharge with respect to any specific transaction during the billing cycle, by dividing the total finance charge for the \nbilling cycle by the amount of the balance(s) to which it is applicable 32 and multiplying the quotient (expressed as a \npercentage) by the number of billing cycles in a year. 33 If there is no balance to which the finance charge is \napplicable, an annual percentage rate cannot be determined under this section. Where the finance charge imposed \nduring the billing cycle is or includes a loan fee, points, or similar charge that relates to opening, renewing, or \ncontinuing an account, the amount of such charge shall not be included in the calculation of the annual percentage \nrate.\n\n(3) Transaction charge imposed. If the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a charge \nrelating to a specific transaction during the billing cycle (even if the total finance charge also includes any other \nminimum, fixed, or other charge not due to the application of a periodic rate), by dividing the total finance charge \nimposed during the billing cycle by the total of all balances and other amounts on which a finance charge was \nimposed during the billing cycle without duplication, and multiplying the quotient (expressed as a percentage) by the \nnumber of billing cycles in a year, 34 except that the annual percentage rate shall not be less than the largest rate \ndetermined by multiplying each periodic rate imposed during the billing cycle by the number of periods in a year. 35 \nWhere the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a loan fee, points, or similar charge that \nrelates to the opening, renewing, or continuing an account, the amount of such charge shall not be included in the \ncalculation of the annual percentage rate. See Appendix F to this part regarding determination of the denominator \nof the fraction under this paragraph.\n\n(4) If the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a minimum, fixed, or other charge not due to \nthe application of a periodic rate and the total finance charge imposed during the billing cycle does not exceed 50 \ncents for a monthly or longer billing cycle, or the pro rata part of 50 cents for a billing cycle shorter than monthly, at \nthe creditor's option, by multiplying each applicable periodic rate by the number of periods in a year, \nnotwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.\n\n(d) Calculations where daily periodic rate applied. If the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(2) of this section \napply and all or a portion of the finance charge is determined by the application of one or more daily periodic rates, \nthe annual percentage rate may be determined either:\n\n(1) By dividing the total finance charge by the average of the daily balances and multiplying the quotient by the \nnumber of billing cycles in a year; or\n\n(2) By dividing the total finance charge by the sum of the daily balances and multiplying the quotient by 365.]\n\n9. Appendix F is removed and reserved as follows:\n\n32 [Reserved].\n\n33 [Reserved].\n\n \n\n \n\n34 [Reserved].\n\n35 [Reserved].\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAppendix F to Part 226 [--Optional Annual Percentage Rate Computations for Creditors Offering Open-End \nPlans Subject to the Requirements of \u00a7 226.5b] [Reserved]\n\n[In determining the denominator of the fraction under \u00a7 226.14(c)(3), no amount will be used more than once when \nadding the sum of the balances 1 subject to periodic rates to the sum of the amounts subject to specific transaction \ncharges. (Where a portion of the finance charge is determined by application of one or more daily periodic rates, the \nphrase \"sum of the balances\" shall also mean the \"average of daily balances.\") In every case, the full amount of \ntransactions subject to specific transaction charges shall be included in the denominator. Other balances or parts of \nbalances shall be included according to the manner of determining the balance subject to a periodic rate, as \nillustrated in the following examples of accounts on monthly billing cycles:\n\n1. Previous balance--none. A specific transaction of $ 100 occurs on the first day of the billing cycle. The average \ndaily balance is $ 100. A specific transaction charge of 3 percent is applicable to the specific transaction. The \nperiodic rate is 11/2 percent applicable to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance \ncharge, which is $ 4.50. The denominator is the amount of the transaction (which is $ 100), plus the amount by \nwhich the balance subject to the periodic rate exceeds the amount of the specific transactions (such excess in this \ncase is 0), totaling $ 100.\n\nThe annual percentage rate is the quotient (which is 4 1/2 percent) multiplied by 12 (the number of months in a \nyear), i.e., 54 percent.\n\n2. Previous balance--$ 100. A specific transaction of $ 100 occurs at the midpoint of the billing cycle. The average \ndaily balance is $ 150. A specific transaction charge of 3 percent is applicable to the specific transaction. The \nperiodic rate is 1 1/2 percent applicable to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance \ncharge which is $ 5.25. The denominator is the amount of the transaction (which is $ 100), plus the amount by \nwhich the balance subject to the periodic rate exceeds the amount of the specific transaction (such excess in this \ncase is $ 50), totaling $ 150. As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 3 1/2 percent x 12 = 42 \npercent.\n\n3. If, in example 2, the periodic rate applies only to the previous balance, the numerator is $ 4.50 and the \ndenominator is $ 200 (the amount of the transaction, $ 100, plus the balance subject only to the periodic rate, the $ \n100 previous balance). As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 2 1/4 percent x 12 = 27 percent.\n\n4. If, in example 2, the periodic rate applies only to an adjusted balance (previous balance less payments and \ncredits) and the consumer made a payment of $ 50 at the midpoint of the billing cycle, the numerator is $ 3.75 and \nthe denominator is $ 150 (the amount of the transaction, $ 100, plus the balance subject to the periodic rate, the $ \n50 adjusted balance). As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 2 1/2 percent x 12 = 30 percent.\n\n5. Previous balance--$ 100. A specific transaction (check) of $ 100 occurs at the midpoint of the billing cycle. The \naverage daily balance is $ 150. The specific transaction charge is $ .25 per check. The periodic rate is 1 1/2 percent \napplied to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance charge, which is $ 2.50 and \nincludes the $ .25 check charge and the $ 2.25 resulting from the application of the periodic rate. The denominator \nis the full amount of the specific transaction (which is $ 100) plus the amount by which the average daily balance \nexceeds the amount of the specific transaction (which in this case is $ 50), totaling $ 150. As explained in example \n1, the annual percentage rate would be 1 2/3 percent x 12 = 20 percent.\n\n1 [Reserved].\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6. Previous balance--none. A specific transaction of $ 100 occurs at the midpoint of the billing cycle. The average \ndaily balance is $ 50. The specific transaction charge is 3 percent of the transaction amount or $ 3.00. The periodic \nrate is 1 1/2 percent per month applied to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance \ncharge, which is $ 3.75, including the $ 3.00 transaction charge and $ .75 resulting from application of the periodic \nrate. The denominator is the full amount of the specific transaction ($ 100) plus the amount by which the balance \nsubject to the periodic rate exceeds the amount of the transaction ($ 0). Where the specific transaction amount \nexceeds the balance subject to the periodic rate, the resulting number is considered to be zero rather than a \nnegative number ($ 50 - $ 100 = -$ 50). The denominator, in this case, is $ 100. As explained in example 1, the \nannual percentage rate is 3 3/4 percent x 12 = 45 percent.]\n\n10. Appendix G to Part 226 is amended by:\n\nA.

Rule for rescission and disclosures for certain mortgage and home-equity line of credit transactions. A more \nprecise rule for what is a business day (all calendar days except Sundays and the federal legal holidays specified in \n5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) applies when the right of rescission or the receipt of disclosures for certain dwelling-secured \nmortgage transactions for purposes of [under] \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(e), 226.9(i)(2), 226.19(a)(1)(ii), 226.19(a)(2), or 226.31(c) \nis involved. Four federal legal holidays are identified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a) by a specific date: New Year's Day, \nJanuary 1; Independence Day, July 4; Veterans Day, November 11; and Christmas Day, December 25. When one \nof these holidays (July 4, for example) falls on a Saturday, federal offices and other entities might observe the \nholiday on the preceding Friday (July 3). In cases where the more precise rule applies, the observed holiday (in the \nexample, July 3) is a business day.\n\n* * * *\n\nSubpart B--Open-end Credit\n\n\u00a7 226.5--General Disclosure Requirements\n\n1. Guidance on compliance with rules for open-end (not home-secured) credit versus rules for home-equity plans. \nIn some cases creditors offering open-end credit plans secured by residential property may not know whether the \nproperty is, or remains, the consumer's principal residence, second or vacation home, or rental or investment \nproperty. If the property is the consumer's principal residence or a second or vacation home (and not rental \nproperty), the credit plan is subject to \u00a7 226.5b and the associated rules for home-equity plans elsewhere in \nRegulation Z such as those in \u00a7\u00a7 226.6(a), 226.7(a), 226.9(c)(1), 226.9(i), and 226.9(j). If the property is the \nconsumer's rental or investment property, and the credit plan is used primarily for personal, family, or household \npurposes, the credit plan is subject to the rules for open-end (not home-secured) credit set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 226.6(b), \n226.7(b), 226.9(c)(2), and 226.9(g). (In this case, if the credit plan is accessible by credit card, the creditor must \nalso comply with the rules applicable to open-end credit card plans under \u00a7 226.5a.) If the credit plan is used \nprimarily for business purposes rather than personal, family, or household purposes, the credit plan is not subject to \nRegulation Z. (See \u00a7 226.3(a) and the related staff commentary provisions for guidance in determining whether \ncredit is considered to be used primarily for business purposes.) In determining which rules apply, creditors may \nrely on the following guidance:\n\ni. For existing credit plans, if the creditor does not know whether the property is or remains the consumer's principal \nresidence or second or vacation home, and the creditor has been complying with the rules under \u00a7 226.5b and \nassociated other rules, the creditor may continue to do so.\n\nii. Alternatively, the creditor in these circumstances may investigate the use of the property. If the creditor ascertains \nthat the property is not used as the consumer's principal residence or as a second or vacation home, but the credit \nplan is nonetheless used for personal, family, or household purposes, the creditor may begin complying with the \n\n\n\nrules applicable to open-end (not home-secured) credit under Regulation Z. In this case, if the credit plan is \naccessible by credit card, the creditor must comply with the rules for open-end (not home-secured) credit card plans \nunder \u00a7 226.5a and associated sections in the regulation, in addition to the rules applicable to open-end credit \ngenerally.\n\niii. When a new open-end credit plan is opened, the creditor may attempt to ascertain the status of the property \nsecuring the plan, and comply accordingly with the appropriate set of rules. However, if the creditor is not able, or \nchooses not, to determine the status of the property, the creditor may comply with the rules for home-equity plans \nunder \u00a7 226.5b and associated sections of the regulation.\n\n5(a) Form of disclosures.\n\n5(a)(1) General.\n\n1. Clear and conspicuous standard. The \"clear and conspicuous\" standard generally requires that disclosures be in \na reasonably understandable form. Disclosures for credit card applications and solicitations under \u00a7 226.5a, \ndisclosures for home-equity plans required three business days after application under \u00a7 226.5b(b), highlighted \naccount-opening disclosures under \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and \u00a7 226.6(b)(1), highlighted disclosure on checks that access a \ncredit card under \u00a7 226.9(b)(3), highlighted change-in-terms disclosures under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B) and \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(2)(iii)(B), and highlighted disclosures when a rate is increased due to delinquency, default or otherwise as \n[for] a penalty under \u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(ii) and \u00a7 226.9(i)(4) must also be readily noticeable to the consumer to meet the \n\"clear and conspicuous\" standard.\n\n2. Clear and conspicuous--reasonably understandable form. Except where otherwise provided, the reasonably \nunderstandable form standard does not require that disclosures be segregated from other material or located in any \nparticular place on the disclosure statement, or that numerical amounts or percentages be in any particular type \nsize. For disclosures that are given orally, the standard requires that they be given at a speed and volume sufficient \nfor a consumer to hear and comprehend them. (See comment 5(b)(1)(ii)-1.) Except where otherwise provided, the \nstandard does not prohibit:\n\ni. Pluralizing required terminology (\"finance charge\" and \"annual percentage rate\").\n\nii. Adding to the required disclosures such items as contractual provisions, explanations of contract terms, state \ndisclosures, and translations.\n\niii. Sending promotional material with the required disclosures.\n\niv. Using commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations (such as \"mo.\" for \"month\" or \"Tx.\" for \n\"Texas\") in making any required disclosures.\n\nv. Using codes or symbols such as \"APR\" (for annual percentage rate), \"FC\" (for finance charge), or \"Cr\" (for credit \nbalance), so long as a legend or description of the code or symbol is provided on the disclosure statement.\n\n3. Clear and conspicuous--readily noticeable standard. To meet the readily noticeable standard, disclosures for \ncredit card applications and solicitations under \u00a7 226.5a, disclosures for home-equity plans required three business \ndays after application under \u00a7 226.5b(b), highlighted account-opening disclosures under \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and \u00a7 \n226.6(b)(1), highlighted disclosures on checks that access a credit card account under \u00a7 226.9(b)(3), highlighted \nchange-in-terms disclosures under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B) and \u00a7 226.9(c)(2)(iii)(B), and highlighted disclosures when a \nrate is increased due to delinquency, default or penalty pricing under \u00a7 226.9(g)(3)(ii) and \u00a7 226.9(i)(4) must be \ngiven in a minimum of 10-point font. (See special rule for font size requirements for the annual percentage rate for \npurchases in an open-end (not home-secured) plan under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a(b)(1) and 226.6(b)(2)(i), and for the annual \npercentage rate in a home-equity plan under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(c)(10) and 226.6(a)(2)(vi).)\n\n4. Integrated document. The creditor may make both the account-opening disclosures (\u00a7 226.6) and the periodic-\nstatement disclosures (\u00a7 226.7) on more than one page, and use both the front and the reverse sides, except where \n\n\n\notherwise indicated, so long as the pages constitute an integrated document. An integrated document would not \ninclude disclosure pages provided to the consumer at different times or disclosures interspersed on the same page \nwith promotional material. An integrated document would include, for example:\n\ni. Multiple pages provided in the same envelope that cover related material and are folded together, numbered \nconsecutively, or clearly labeled to show that they relate to one another; or\n\nii. A brochure that contains disclosures and explanatory material about a range of services the creditor offers, such \nas credit, checking account, and electronic fund transfer features.\n\n5. Disclosures covered. Disclosures that must meet the \"clear and conspicuous\" standard include all required \ncommunications under this subpart. For example, disclosures made by a person other than the card issuer, such as \ndisclosures of finance charges imposed at the time of honoring a consumer's credit card under \u00a7 226.9(d), and \nnotices, such as the correction notice required to be sent to the consumer under \u00a7 226.13(e), must also be clear \nand conspicuous.\n\nParagraph 5(a)(1)(ii)(A).\n\n1. Electronic disclosures. Disclosures that need not be provided in writing under \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) may be \nprovided in writing, orally, or in electronic form. If the consumer requests the service in electronic form, such as on \nthe creditor's Web site, the specified disclosures may be provided in electronic form without regard to the consumer \nconsent or other provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 \nU.S.C. 7001 et seq.).\n\nParagraph 5(a)(1)(iii).\n\n1. Disclosures not subject to E-Sign Act. See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) regarding disclosures (in \naddition to those specified under \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(iii)) that may be provided in electronic form without regard to the \nconsumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.\n\n5(a)(2) Terminology.\n\n[1. When disclosures must be more conspicuous. For home-equity plans subject to \u00a7 226.5b, the terms finance \ncharge and annual percentage rate, when required to be used with a number, must be disclosed more \nconspicuously than other required disclosures, except in the cases provided in \u00a7 226.5(a)(2)(ii). At the creditor's \noption, finance charge and annual percentage rate may also be disclosed more conspicuously than the other \nrequired disclosures even when the regulation does not so require. The following examples illustrate these rules:\n\ni. In disclosing the annual percentage rate as required by \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii), the term annual percentage rate is \nsubject to the more conspicuous rule.\n\nii. In disclosing the amount of the finance charge, required by \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(i), the term finance charge is subject to \nthe more conspicuous rule.\n\niii. Although neither finance charge nor annual percentage rate need be emphasized when used as part of general \ninformational material or in textual descriptions of other terms, emphasis is permissible in such cases. For example, \nwhen the terms appear as part of the explanations required under \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv), they may be \nequally conspicuous as the disclosures required under \u00a7\u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii) and 226.7(a)(7).\n\n2. Making disclosures more conspicuous. In disclosing the terms finance charge and annual percentage rate more \nconspicuously for home-equity plans subject to \u00a7 226.5b, only the words finance charge and annual percentage \nrate should be accentuated. For example, if the term total finance charge is used, only finance charge should be \nemphasized. The disclosures may be made more conspicuous by, for example:\n\ni. Capitalizing the words when other disclosures are printed in lower case.\n\n\n\nii. Putting them in bold print or a contrasting color.\n\niii. Underlining them.\n\niv. Setting them off with asterisks.\n\nv. Printing them in larger type.\n\n3. Disclosure of figures--exception to more conspicuous rule. For home-equity plans subject to \u00a7 226.5b, the terms \nannual percentage rate and finance charge need not be more conspicuous than figures (including, for example, \nnumbers, percentages, and dollar signs).]\n\n1. [4.] Consistent terminology. Language used in disclosures required in this subpart must be close enough in \nmeaning to enable the consumer to relate the different disclosures; however, the language need not be identical.\n\n5(b) Time of disclosures.\n\n5(b)(1) Account-opening disclosures.\n\n5(b)(1)(i) General rule.\n\n1. Disclosure before the first transaction. When disclosures must be furnished \"before the first transaction,\" \naccount-opening disclosures must be delivered before the consumer becomes obligated on the plan. Examples \ninclude:\n\ni. Purchases. The consumer makes the first purchase, such as when a consumer opens a credit plan and makes \npurchases contemporaneously at a retail store, except when the consumer places a telephone call to make the \npurchase and opens the plan contemporaneously (see commentary to \u00a7 226.5(b)(1)(iii) below).\n\nii. Advances. The consumer receives the first advance. If the consumer receives a cash advance check at the same \ntime the account-opening disclosures are provided, disclosures are still timely if the consumer can, after receiving \nthe disclosures, return the cash advance check to the creditor without obligation (for example, without paying \nfinance charges).\n\n2. Reactivation of suspended account. If an account is temporarily suspended (for example, for open-end (not \nhome-secured) plans, because the consumer has exceeded a credit limit, or because a credit card is reported lost \nor stolen) and then is reactivated, no new account-opening disclosures are required.\n\n3. Reopening closed account. If an account has been closed (for example, for open-end (not home-secured) plans, \ndue to inactivity, cancellation, or expiration) and then is reopened, new account-opening disclosures are required. \nNo new account-opening disclosures are required, however, when the account is closed merely to assign it a new \nnumber (for example, when a credit card is reported lost or stolen) and the \"new\" account then continues on the \nsame terms.\n\n4. Converting closed-end to open-end credit. If a closed-end credit transaction is converted to an open-end credit \naccount under a written agreement with the consumer, account-opening disclosures under \u00a7 226.6 must be given \nbefore the consumer becomes obligated on the open-end credit plan. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.17 on \nconverting open-end credit to closed-end credit.)\n\n5. Balance transfers. A creditor that solicits the transfer by a consumer of outstanding balances from an existing \naccount to a new open-end plan must furnish the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.6 so that the consumer has an \nopportunity, after receiving the disclosures, to contact the creditor before the balance is transferred and decline the \ntransfer. For example, assume a consumer responds to a card issuer's solicitation for a credit card account subject \nto \u00a7 226.5a that offers a range of balance transfer annual percentage rates, based on the consumer's \ncreditworthiness. If the creditor opens an account for the consumer, the creditor would comply with the timing rules \n\n\n\nof this section by providing the consumer with the annual percentage rate (along with the fees and other required \ndisclosures) that would apply to the balance transfer in time for the consumer to contact the creditor and withdraw \nthe request. A creditor that permits consumers to withdraw the request by telephone has met this timing standard if \nthe creditor does not affect the balance transfer until 10 days after the creditor has sent account-opening \ndisclosures to the consumer, assuming the consumer has not contacted the creditor to withdraw the request. Card \nissuers that are subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5a may establish procedures that comply with both \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a \nand 226.6 in a single disclosure statement.\n\n5(b)(1)(ii) Charges imposed as part of an open-end [(not home-secured)] plan.\n\n1. Disclosing charges before the fee is imposed. Creditors may disclose charges imposed as part of an open-end \n[(not home-secured)] plan orally or in writing at any time before a consumer agrees to pay the fee or becomes \nobligated for the charge, unless the charge is specified under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) or \u00a7 226.6(b)(2). (Charges imposed as \npart of an open-end [(not home-secured plan)] that are not specified under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2) or \u00a7 226.6(b)(2) may \nalternatively be disclosed in electronic form; see the commentary to \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(A).) Creditors must provide \nsuch disclosures at a time and in a manner such that a consumer would be likely to notice them. For example, if a \nconsumer telephones a creditor [card issuer] to discuss a particular service, a creditor would meet the standard if \nthe creditor clearly and conspicuously discloses the fee associated with the service that is the topic of the telephone \ncall orally to the consumer. Similarly, a creditor providing marketing materials in writing to a consumer about a \nparticular service would meet the standard if the creditor provided a clear and conspicuous written disclosure of the \nfee for that service in those same materials. A creditor that provides written materials to a consumer about a \nparticular service but provides a fee disclosure for another service not promoted in such materials would not meet \nthe standard. For example, if a creditor provided marketing materials promoting payment by Internet, but included \nthe fee for a replacement card on such materials with no explanation, the creditor would not be disclosing the fee at \na time and in a manner that the consumer would be likely to notice the fee.\n\n2. Relationship to rule prohibiting changes in home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject to \u00a7 \n226.5b are subject to the rules under \u00a7 226.5b(f) restricting changes in terms. Therefore, even though the rule in \u00a7 \n226.5(b)(1)(ii) permits certain charges to be disclosed at a time later than account opening, a home-equity plan \ncreditor would not be permitted to impose a charge for a feature or service previously not subject to a charge, or to \nincrease a charge for a feature or service previously subject to a lower charge, even if the absence of a charge, or \nthe lower charge, had not been previously disclosed to the consumer.\n\n5(b)(1)(iii) Telephone purchases.\n\n1. Return policies. In order for creditors to provide disclosures in accordance with the timing requirements of this \nparagraph, consumers must be permitted to return merchandise purchased at the time the plan was established \nwithout paying mailing or return-shipment costs. Creditors may impose costs to return subsequent purchases of \nmerchandise under the plan, or to return merchandise purchased by other means such as a credit card issued by \nanother creditor. A reasonable return policy would be of sufficient duration that the consumer is likely to have \nreceived the disclosures and had sufficient time to make a decision about the financing plan before his or her right \nto return the goods expires. Return policies need not provide a right to return goods if the consumer consumes or \ndamages the goods, or for installed appliances or fixtures, provided there is a reasonable repair or replacement \npolicy to cover defective goods or installations. If the consumer chooses to reject the financing plan, creditors \ncomply with the requirements of this paragraph by permitting the consumer to pay for the goods with another \nreasonable form of payment acceptable to the merchant and keep the goods although the creditor cannot require \nthe consumer to do so.\n\n5(b)(1)(iv) Membership fees.\n\n1. Membership fees. See \u00a7 226.5a(b)(2) and related commentary for guidance on fees for issuance or availability of \na credit or charge card.\n\n\n\n2. Rejecting the plan. If a consumer has paid or promised to pay a membership fee including an application fee \nexcludable from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(1) before receiving account-opening disclosures, the \nconsumer may, after receiving the disclosures, reject the plan and not be obligated for the membership fee, \napplication fee, or any other fee or charge. A consumer who has received the disclosures and uses the account, or \nmakes a payment on the account after receiving a billing statement, is deemed not to have rejected the plan.\n\n3. Using the account. A consumer uses an account by obtaining an extension of credit after receiving the account-\nopening disclosures, such as by making a purchase or obtaining an advance. A consumer does not \"use\" the \naccount by activating the account. A consumer also does not \"use\" the account when the creditor assesses fees on \nthe account (such as start-up fees or fees associated with credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension \nprograms agreed to as a part of the application and before the consumer receives account-opening disclosures). \nFor example, the consumer does not \"use\" the account when a creditor sends a billing statement with start-up fees, \nthere is no other activity on the account, the consumer does not pay the fees, and the creditor subsequently \nassesses a late fee or interest on the unpaid fee balances. A consumer also does not \"use\" the account by paying \nan application fee excludable from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(1) prior to receiving the account-opening \ndisclosures.\n\n4. Home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b are subject to \nthe requirements of \u00a7 226.5b[(g)] (d) and (e) regarding the collection and refundability of fees.\n\n5(b)(2) Periodic statements.\n\nParagraph 5(b)(2)(i).\n\n1. Periodic statements not required. Periodic statements need not be sent in the following cases:\n\ni. If the creditor adjusts an account balance so that at the end of the cycle the balance is less than $ 1--so long as \nno finance charge has been imposed on the account for that cycle.\n\nii. If a statement was returned as undeliverable. If a new address is provided, however, within a reasonable time \nbefore the creditor must send a statement, the creditor must resume sending statements. Receiving the address at \nleast 20 days before the end of a cycle would be a reasonable amount of time to prepare the statement for that \ncycle. For example, if an address is received 22 days before the end of the June cycle, the creditor must send the \nperiodic statement for the June cycle. (See \u00a7 226.13(a)(7).)\n\n2. Termination of draw privileges. When a consumer's ability to draw on an open-end account is terminated without \nbeing converted to closed-end credit under a written agreement, the creditor must continue to provide periodic \nstatements to those consumers entitled to receive them under \u00a7 226.5(b)(2)(i), for example, when the draw period \nof an open-end credit plan ends and consumers are paying off outstanding balances according to the account \nagreement or under the terms of a workout agreement that is not converted to a closed-end transaction. In addition, \ncreditors must continue to follow all of the other open-end credit requirements and procedures in subpart B.\n\n3. Uncollectible accounts. An account is deemed uncollectible for purposes of \u00a7 226.5(b)(2)(i) when a creditor has \nceased collection efforts, either directly or through a third party.\n\n4. Instituting collection proceedings. Creditors institute a delinquency collection proceeding by filing a court action or \ninitiating an adjudicatory process with a third party. Assigning a debt to a debt collector or other third party would \nnot constitute instituting a collection proceeding.\n\nParagraph 5(b)(2)(ii).\n\n1. 14-day rule. The 14-day rule for mailing or delivering periodic statements does not apply if charges (for example, \ntransaction or activity charges) are imposed regardless of the timing of a periodic statement. The 14-day rule does \napply, for example:\n\n\n\ni. If current debits retroactively become subject to finance charges when the balance is not paid in full by a specified \ndate.\n\nii. For open-end plans not subject to 12 CFR part 227, subpart C; 12 CFR part 535, subpart C; or 12 CFR part 706, \nsubpart C, if charges other than finance charges will accrue when the consumer does not make timely payments \n(for example, late payment charges or charges for exceeding a credit limit). (For consumer credit card accounts \nsubject to 12 CFR part 227, subpart C; 12 CFR part 535, subpart C; or 12 CFR part 706, subpart C, see 12 CFR \n227.22, 12 CFR 535.22, or 12 CFR 706.22, as applicable.)\n\n2. Deferred interest transactions. See comment 7(b)-1.iv.\n\nParagraph 5(b)(2)(iii).\n\n1. Computer malfunction. The exceptions identified in \u00a7 226.5(b)(2)(iii) of this section do not extend to the failure to \nprovide a periodic statement because of computer malfunction.\n\n2. Calling for periodic statements. When the consumer initiates a request, the creditor may permit, but may not \nrequire, consumers to pick up their periodic statements. If the consumer wishes to pick up the statement and the \nplan has a grace period, the statement must be made available in accordance with the 14-day rule.\n\n5(e) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates.\n\n1. Legal obligation. The disclosures should reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound at the time \nof giving the disclosures.\n\ni. The legal obligation is determined by applicable state or other law.\n\nii. The fact that a term or contract may later be deemed unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or other \ngrounds does not, by itself, mean that disclosures based on that term or contract did not reflect the legal obligation.\n\niii. The legal obligation normally is presumed to be contained in the contract that evidences the agreement. But this \nmay be rebutted if another agreement between the parties legally modifies that contract.\n\n2. Estimates--obtaining information. Disclosures may be estimated when the exact information is unknown at the \ntime disclosures are made. Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time \ndisclosures are made. The reasonably available standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise \ndue diligence in obtaining information. In using estimates, the creditor is not required to disclose the basis for the \nestimated figures, but may include such explanations as additional information. The creditor normally may rely on \nthe representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might look to insurance \ncompanies for the cost of insurance.\n\n3. Estimates--redisclosure. If the creditor makes estimated disclosures, redisclosure is not required for that \nconsumer, even though more accurate information becomes available before the first transaction. For example, in \nan open-end plan to be secured by real estate, the creditor may estimate the appraisal fees to be charged; such an \nestimate might reasonably be based on the prevailing market rates for similar appraisals. If the exact appraisal fee \nis determinable after the estimate is furnished but before the consumer receives the first advance under the plan, \nno new disclosure is necessary.\n\n5(d) Multiple creditors; multiple consumers.\n\n1. Multiple creditors. Under \u00a7 226.5(d):\n\ni. Creditors must choose which creditor [of them] will make the disclosures.\n\nii. A single, complete set of disclosures must be provided, rather than partial disclosures from several creditors.\n\n\n\niii. All disclosures for the open-end credit plan must be given, even if the disclosing creditor would not otherwise \nhave been obligated to make a particular disclosure.\n\n2. Multiple consumers. Disclosures may be made to either obligor on a joint account. Disclosure responsibilities are \nnot satisfied by giving disclosures to only a surety or guarantor for a principal obligor or to an authorized user. In \nrescindable transactions, however, separate disclosures must be given to each consumer who has the right to \nrescind under \u00a7 226.15.\n\n3. Card issuer and person extending credit not the same person. Section 127(c)(4)(D) of the Truth in Lending Act \n(15 U.S.C. 1637(c)(4)(D)) contains rules pertaining to charge card issuers with plans that allow access to an open-\nend credit plan that is maintained by a person other than the charge card issuer. These rules are not implemented \nin Regulation Z (although they were formerly implemented in \u00a7 226.5a(f)). However, the statutory provisions remain \nin effect and may be used by charge card issuers with plans meeting the specified criteria.\n\n5(e) Effect of subsequent events.\n\n1. Events causing inaccuracies. Inaccuracies in disclosures are not violations if attributable to events occurring after \ndisclosures are made. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the collateral \ninsured and the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make \nthe original disclosures inaccurate. The creditor may, however, be required to provide a new disclosure(s) under \u00a7 \n226.9(c).\n\n2. Use of inserts. When changes in a creditor's plan affect required disclosures, the creditor may use inserts with \noutdated disclosure forms. Any insert:\n\ni. Should clearly refer to the disclosure provision it replaces.\n\nii. Need not be physically attached or affixed to the basic disclosure statement.\n\niii. May be used only until the supply of outdated forms is exhausted.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.5b--Requirements for Home-equity Plans.\n\n1. Coverage. This section applies to all open-end credit plans secured by the consumer's \"dwelling,\" as defined in \u00a7 \n226.2(a)(19), and is not limited to plans secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. (See the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.3(a), which discusses whether transactions are consumer or business-purpose credit, for guidance on whether \na home-equity plan is subject to Regulation Z.)\n\n2. Changes to home-equity plans [entered into on or after November 7, 1989]. Section 226.9(c) applies if, by written \nagreement under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a home-equity plan [--entered into on or after \nNovember 7, 1989--] at or before its scheduled expiration, for example, by renewing a plan on different terms. A \nnew plan results, however, if the plan is renewed (with or without changes to the terms) after the scheduled \nexpiration. The new plan is subject to all open-end credit rules, including \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b, 226.6, and 226.15.\n\n[3. Transition rules and renewals of preexisting plans. The requirements of this section do not apply to home-equity \nplans entered into before November 7, 1989. The requirements of this section also do not apply if the original \nconsumer, on or after November 7, 1989, renews a plan entered into prior to that date (with or without changes to \nthe terms). If, on or after November 7, 1989, a security interest in the consumer's dwelling is added to a line of \ncredit entered into before that date, the substantive restrictions of this section apply for the remainder of the plan, \nbut no new disclosures are required under this section.\n\n4. Disclosure of repayment phase--applicability of requirements. Some plans provide in the initial agreement for a \nperiod during which no further draws may be taken and repayment of the amount borrowed is made. All of the \napplicable disclosures in this section must be given for the repayment phase. Thus, for example, a creditor must \n\n\n\nprovide payment information about the repayment phase as well as about the draw period, as required by \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(5). If the rate that will apply during the repayment phase is fixed at a known amount, the creditor must \nprovide an annual percentage rate under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(6) for that phase. If, however, a creditor uses an index to \ndetermine the rate that will apply at the time of conversion to the repayment phase--even if the rate will thereafter \nbe fixed--the creditor must provide the information in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12), as applicable.]\n\n3. [5.] Payment terms--applicability of closed-end provisions and substantive rules. All payment terms that are \nprovided for in the initial agreement are subject to the requirements of subpart B and not subpart C of the \nregulation. Payment terms that are subsequently added to the agreement may be subject to subpart B or to subpart \nC, depending on the circumstances. The following examples apply these general rules to different situations:\n\n(i) If the initial agreement provides for a repayment phase or for other payment terms such as options permitting \nconversion of part or all of the balance to a fixed rate during the draw period, these terms must be disclosed \npursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b and 226.6, and not under subpart C. Furthermore, the creditor must continue to provide \nperiodic statements under \u00a7 226.7 and comply with other provisions of subpart B (such as the substantive \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.5b(f)) throughout the plan, including the repayment phase.\n\n(ii) If the consumer and the creditor enter into an agreement during the draw period to repay all or part of the \nprincipal balance on different terms (for example, with a fixed rate of interest) and the amount of available credit will \nbe replenished as the principal balance is repaid, the creditor must continue to comply with subpart B. For example, \nthe creditor must continue to provide periodic statements and comply with the substantive requirements of \u00a7 \n226.5b(f) throughout the plan.\n\n(iii) If the consumer and creditor enter into an agreement during the draw period to repay all or part of the principal \nbalance and the amount of available credit will not be replenished as the principal balance is repaid, the creditor \nmust give closed-end credit disclosures pursuant to subpart C for that new agreement. In such cases, subpart B, \nincluding the substantive rules, does not apply to the closed-end credit transaction, although it will continue to apply \nto any remaining open-end credit available under the plan.\n\n4. [6.] Spreader clause. When a creditor holds a mortgage or deed of trust on the consumer's dwelling and that \nmortgage or deed of trust contains a spreader clause (also known as a dragnet or cross-collateralization clause), \nsubsequent occurrences such as the opening of an open-end plan are subject to the rules applicable to home-\nequity plans to the same degree as if a security interest were taken directly to secure the plan, unless the creditor \neffectively waives its security interest under the spreader clause with respect to the subsequent open-end credit \nextensions.\n\n5b(a) Home-equity Document Provided on or with the Application.\n\n5b(a)(1) In General.\n\n1. Mail and telephone applications. If an application is sent through the mail, the document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a) \nmust accompany the application. If an application is taken over the telephone, the document must be delivered or \nmailed not later than account opening or three business days following receipt of a consumer's application by the \ncreditor, whichever is earlier. If an application is mailed to the consumer following a telephone request, however, \nthe document must be sent along with the application.\n\n2. General purpose applications. The document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a) need not be provided when a general \npurpose application is given to a consumer unless (1) the application or materials accompanying it indicate that it \ncan be used to apply for a home-equity plan or (2) the application is provided in response to a consumer's specific \ninquiry about a home-equity plan. On the other hand, if a general purpose application is provided in response to a \nconsumer's specific inquiry only about credit other than a home-equity plan, the document need not be provided \neven if the application indicates it can be used for a home-equity plan, unless it is accompanied by promotional \ninformation about home-equity plans.\n\n\n\n3. Publicly-available applications. Some creditors make applications for home-equity plans, such as take-ones, \navailable without the need for a consumer to request them. These applications must be accompanied by the \ndocument required by \u00a7 226.5b(a), such as by attaching the document to the application form.\n\n4. Response cards. A creditor may solicit consumers for its home-equity plan by mailing a response card which the \nconsumer returns to the creditor to indicate interest in the plan. If the only action taken by the creditor upon receipt \nof the response card is to send the consumer an application form or to telephone the consumer to discuss the plan, \nthe creditor need not send the document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a) with the response card. See comment 5b(a)(1)-1 \ndiscussing mail and telephone applications.\n\n5. Denial or withdrawal of application. Section 226.5b(a)(1)(ii) provides that for telephone applications and \napplications received through an intermediary agent or broker, creditors must deliver or mail the document required \nby \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1)(i) to the consumer not later than account opening or three business days following receipt of a \nconsumer's application by the creditor, whichever is earlier. If the creditor determines within that three-day period \nthat an application will not be approved, the creditor need not provide the document. Similarly, if the consumer \nwithdraws the application within this three-day period, the creditor need not provide the document.\n\n6. Prominent location. i. When document not given in electronic form. The document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) \nmust be prominently located on or with the application. The document is deemed to be prominently located, for \nexample, if the document is on the same page as an application. If the document appears elsewhere, it is deemed \nto be prominently located if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the \ndocument and indicates that the document provides information about home-equity lines of credit.\n\nii. Form of electronic document provided on or with electronic applications. Generally, creditors must provide the \ndocument required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) in a prominent location on or with a blank application that is made available to \nthe consumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web site. (See comment 5b(a)(2)-1) Creditors \nhave flexibility in satisfying this requirement. Methods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are \nnot limited to, the following examples:\n\nA. The document could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears;\n\nB. The document could be located on the same Web page as the application (whether or not they appear on the \ninitial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the document and \nindicates the document provides information about home-equity lines of credit.\n\nC. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic document on or with the application as long as consumers cannot \nbypass the document before submitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the document, but the \nconsumer need not be required to scroll completely through the document; or\n\nD. The document could be located on the same web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the \ninitial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application.\n\nWhatever method is used, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the document.\n\n7. Intermediary agent or broker. In determining whether or not an application involves an intermediary agent or \nbroker as discussed in \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1)(ii), creditors should consult the provisions in comment 19(d)(3)-3.\n\n8. Definition of \"business day\". The general definition of \"business day\" in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the \ncreditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions--is used for \npurposes of \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1)(ii). See comment 2(a)(6)-1.\n\n9. As published. The document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) must be provided as published by the Board. A creditor \nmay not revise the document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1).\n\n5b(a)(2) Electronic Disclosures.\n\n\n\n1. When electronic disclosure must be given. Whether the document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) must be in \nelectronic form depends upon the following:\n\ni. If a consumer accesses a home-equity credit line application electronically (other than as described under ii. \nbelow), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosure required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) in \nelectronic form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to provide the \ndisclosure in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed a paper disclosure to the \nconsumer, this requirement would not be met.\n\nii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a home-equity credit line \napplication electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or kiosk located on the \npremises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the \ncreditor may provide the disclosure in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, \ndelivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.\n\n5b(a)(3) Duties of Third Parties.\n\n1. Duties of third parties. The duties under \u00a7 226.5b(a)(3) are those of the third party; the creditor is not responsible \nfor ensuring that a third party complies with those obligations.\n\n2. Effect of third party delivery of document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1). If a creditor determines that a third party has \nprovided a consumer with the document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1), the creditor need not give the consumer a \nsecond copy of the document.\n\n3. Telephone applications taken by third party. For telephone applications taken by a third party, the third party is \nnot required to provide the document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1). The document required by \u00a7 226.5b(a)(1) must be \nprovided by the creditor not later than account opening or three business days following receipt of the consumer's \napplication by the creditor, whichever is earlier, along with the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.5b(b).\n\n5b(b) Home-Equity Disclosures Provided No Later Than Account Opening or Three Business Days After \nApplication, Whichever is Earlier\n\n5b(b)(1) Timing.\n\n1. Denial or withdrawal of application. Section 226.5b(b)(1) provides that creditors must deliver or mail disclosures \nrequired by \u00a7 226.5b(b) to the consumer not later than account opening or three business days following receipt of \na consumer's application by the creditor, whichever is earlier. If the creditor determines within the three-day period \nthat an application will not be approved, the creditor need not provide the disclosures. Similarly, if the consumer \nwithdraws the application within this three-day period, the creditor need not provide the disclosures.\n\n2. Definition of \"business day\". The general definition of \"business day\" in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the \ncreditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions--is used for \npurposes of \u00a7 226.5b(b)(1). See comment 2(a)(6)-1.\n\n5b(b)(2) Form of disclosures; tabular format.\n\n1. Terminology. Section 226.5b(b)(2)(i) generally requires that the headings, content and format of the tabular \ndisclosures be substantially similar, but need not be identical, to the applicable tables in Appendix G-14 to part 226. \nSee \u00a7 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(b).\n\n2. Other format requirements. See \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) for formatting requirements applicable to disclosure of certain \npayment terms in the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b). See \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(1) for formatting requirements \napplicable to disclosure of variable rates in the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b). See comments 5b(c)(7)(ii)-1, \n\n\n\n5b(c)(9)(ii)-5, 5b(c)(14)-1 and 5b(c)(18)-2 for format requirements that apply to information that a creditor provides \nto a consumer upon request.\n\n3. Highlighting of disclosures. i. In general. See Samples G-14(C), G-14(D) and G-14(E) for guidance on providing \nthe disclosures described in \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(vi) in bold text.\n\nii. Periodic fees. Section 226.5b(b)(2)(vi)(D) provides that any periodic fee disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) \nthat is not an annualized amount must not be disclosed in bold. For example, if a creditor imposes a $ 10 monthly \nmaintenance fee for a HELOC account, the creditor must disclose in the table that there is a $ 10 monthly \nmaintenance fee, and that the fee is $ 120 on an annual basis. In this example, the $ 10 fee disclosure would not \nbe disclosed in bold, but the $ 120 annualized amount must be disclosed in bold. In addition, if a creditor must \ndisclose any annual fee in the table, the amount of the annual fee must be disclosed in bold.\n\niii. Format requirements under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). Section 226.5b(b)(2)(vi)(E) provides that if a creditor is required \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) to provide a disclosure in a format substantially similar to the format used in any of the \napplicable tables found in Samples G-14(C), 14(D) or 14(E), the creditor in making that disclosure must provide in \nbold text any terms and phrases that are shown in bold text with regard to that disclosure in the applicable tables. \nFor example, \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) provides that a creditor must distinguish payment terms applicable to the draw period \nfrom payment terms applicable to the repayment period, by using the applicable heading \"Borrowing Period\" for the \ndraw period and \"Repayment Period\" for the repayment period in a format substantially similar to the format used in \nany of the applicable tables found in Samples G-14(C) and G-14(E). Because the tables found in Samples G-14(C) \nand G-14(E) show the heading \"Borrowing Period\" and \"Repayment Period\" in bold text, a creditor must disclose \nthese headings in bold text. See \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i) and (c)(9)(iii)(D) for other instances in which a creditor may be \nrequired to provide disclosures in a format substantially similar to the format used in any of the applicable tables \nfound in Samples G-14(C), G-14(D) and G-14(E).\n\niv. Itemized list of fees to open the plan. The total amount of account-opening fees disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) \nmust be disclosed in bold text. The itemization of those fees also required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) \nmust not be disclosed in bold text.\n\n4. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to \u00a7 \n226.5b(b) disclosures.\n\n5b(b)(3) Disclosures Based on a Percentage.\n\n1. Transaction requirements. Section 226.5b(c)(16) requires a creditor to disclose in the table required under \u00a7 \n226.5b(b) any limitations on the number of extensions of credit and the amount of credit that may be obtained \nduring any time period, as well as any minimum outstanding balance and minimum draw requirements. If any \namount that must be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(16) is determined on the basis of a percentage of another \namount, the percentage used and the identification of the amount against which the percentage is applied may be \ndisclosed instead of the transaction amount.\n\n[5b(a) Form of Disclosures\n\n5b(a)(1) General.\n\n1. Written disclosures. The disclosures required under this section must be clear and conspicuous and in writing, \nbut need not be in a form the consumer can keep. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) for special rules when \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b(d) are given in a retainable form.)\n\n2. Disclosure of annual percentage rate--more conspicuous requirement. As provided in \u00a7 226.5(a)(2), when the \nterm annual percentage rate is required to be disclosed with a number, it must be more conspicuous than other \nrequired disclosures.\n\n\n\n3. Segregation of disclosures. While most of the disclosures must be grouped together and segregated from all \nunrelated information, the creditor is permitted to include information that explains or expands on the required \ndisclosures, including, for example:\n\n. Any prepayment penalty\n\n. How a substitute index may be chosen\n\n. Actions the creditor may take short of terminating and accelerating an outstanding balance\n\n. Renewal terms\n\n. Rebate of fees\n\nAn example of information that does not explain or expand on the required disclosures and thus cannot be included \nis the creditor's underwriting criteria, although the creditor could provide such information separately from the \nrequired disclosures.\n\n4. Method of providing disclosures. A creditor may provide a single disclosure form for all of its home-equity plans, \nas long as the disclosure describes all aspects of the plans. For example, if the creditor offers several payment \noptions, all such options must be disclosed. (See, however, the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12)(x) and \n(xi) for disclosure requirements relating to these provisions.) If any aspects of a plan are linked together, the creditor \nmust disclose clearly the relationship of the terms to each other. For example, if the consumer can only obtain a \nparticular payment option in conjunction with a certain variable-rate feature, this fact must be disclosed. A creditor \nhas the option of providing separate disclosure forms for multiple options or variations in features. For example, a \ncreditor that offers different payment options for the draw period may prepare separate disclosure forms for the two \npayment options. A creditor using this alternative, however, must include a statement on each disclosure form that \nthe consumer should ask about the creditor's other home-equity programs. (This disclosure is required only for \nthose programs available generally to the public. Thus, if the only other programs available are employee preferred-\nrate plans, for example, the creditor would not have to provide this statement.) A creditor that receives a request for \ninformation about other available programs must provide the additional disclosures as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n5. Form of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic applications. Creditors must provide the disclosures \nrequired by this section (including the brochure) on or with a blank application that is made available to the \nconsumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web site. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying this \nrequirement. Methods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are not limited to, the following \nexamples:\n\ni. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears;\n\nii. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application (whether or not they appear on the \ninitial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and \nindicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable;\n\niii. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on or with the application as long as consumers \ncannot bypass the disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the \ndisclosures, but the consumer need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or\n\niv. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the \ninitial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application.\n\nWhatever method is used, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the disclosures.\n\n5b(a)(2) Precedence of Certain Disclosures.\n\n\n\n1. Precedence rule. The list of conditions provided at the creditor's option under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(iii) need not precede \nthe other disclosures.\n\nParagraph 5b(a)(3).\n\n1. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic form depends upon the following:\n\ni. If a consumer accesses a home-equity credit line application electronically (other than as described under ii. \nbelow), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in electronic form (such as \nwith the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner \non or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the consumer, this requirement would \nnot be met.\n\nii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a home-equity credit line \napplication electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or kiosk located on the \npremises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the \ncreditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, \ndelivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.\n\n5b(b) Time of Disclosures\n\n1. Mail and telephone applications. If the creditor sends applications through the mail, the disclosures and a \nbrochure must accompany the application. If an application is taken over the telephone, the disclosures and \nbrochure may be delivered or mailed within three business days of taking the application. If an application is mailed \nto the consumer following a telephone request, however, the creditor also must send the disclosures and a \nbrochure along with the application.\n\n2. General purpose applications. The disclosures and a brochure need not be provided when a general purpose \napplication is given to a consumer unless (1) the application or materials accompanying it indicate that it can be \nused to apply for a home-equity plan or (2) the application is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry \nabout a home-equity plan. On the other hand, if a general purpose application is provided in response to a \nconsumer's specific inquiry only about credit other than a home-equity plan, the disclosures and brochure need not \nbe provided even if the application indicates it can be used for a home-equity plan, unless it is accompanied by \npromotional information about home-equity plans.\n\n3. Publicly-available applications. Some creditors make applications for home-equity plans, such as take-ones, \navailable without the need for a consumer to request them. These applications must be accompanied by the \ndisclosures and a brochure, such as by attaching the disclosures and brochure to the application form.\n\n4. Response cards. A creditor may solicit consumers for its home-equity plan by mailing a response card which the \nconsumer returns to the creditor to indicate interest in the plan. If the only action taken by the creditor upon receipt \nof the response card is to send the consumer an application form or to telephone the consumer to discuss the plan, \nthe creditor need not send the disclosures and brochure with the response card.\n\n5. Denial or withdrawal of application. In situations where footnote 10a permits the creditor a three-day delay in \nproviding disclosures and the brochure, if the creditor determines within that period that an application will not be \napproved, the creditor need not provide the consumer with the disclosures or brochure. Similarly, if the consumer \nwithdraws the application within this three-day period, the creditor need not provide the disclosures or brochure.\n\n6. Intermediary agent or broker. In determining whether or not an application involves an intermediary agent or \nbroker as discussed in footnote 10a, creditors should consult the provisions in comment 19(b)-3.\n\n5b(c) Duties of Third Parties\n\n\n\n1. Disclosure requirements. Although third parties who give applications to consumers for home-equity plans must \nprovide the brochure required under \u00a7 226.5b(e) in all cases, such persons need provide the disclosures required \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(d) only in certain instances. A third party has no duty to obtain disclosures about a creditor's home-\nequity plan or to create a set of disclosures based on what it knows about a creditor's plan. If, however, a creditor \nprovides the third party with disclosures along with its application form, the third party must give the disclosures to \nthe consumer with the application form. The duties under this section are those of the third party; the creditor is not \nresponsible for ensuring that a third party complies with those obligations. If an intermediary agent or broker takes \nan application over the telephone or receives an application contained in a magazine or other publication, footnote \n10a permits that person to mail the disclosures and brochure within three business days of receipt of the \napplication. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(h) about imposition of nonrefundable fees.)]\n\n5b[(d)] (c) Content of Disclosures\n\n1. Disclosures given as applicable. The disclosures required under this section generally need be made only as \napplicable. Thus, for example, if negative amortization cannot occur in a home-equity plan, a reference to it need \nnot be made. Nonetheless, there are exceptions to this general rule. Specifically, in certain circumstances, a \ncreditor must state that a balloon payment will not result for payment plans in which no balloon payment would \noccur, as set forth in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(3) and\n\n(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4). In addition, if there are no annual or other periodic limitations on changes in the annual percentage \nrate, a creditor must state that no annual limitation exists, as set forth in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(5).\n\n2. Duty to respond to requests for information. If the consumer, prior to the opening of a plan, requests information \ndescribed [as suggested] in the disclosures (such as additional information about fees applicable to the plan or the \nconditions under which the creditor may make take certain actions with respect to the plan [the current index value \nor margin]), the creditor must provide this information as soon as reasonably possible after the request. See \ncomments 5b(c)(7)(ii)-1, 5b(c)(9)(ii)-5, 5b(c)(14)-1 and 5b(c)(18)-2 for format requirements that apply to information \nthat a creditor provides to a consumer upon request.\n\n3. Disclosure of repayment phase--applicability of requirements. Some plans provide in the initial agreement for a \nperiod during which the consumer may make no further draws and must repay all or a portion of the amount \nborrowed. All of the applicable disclosures in this section must be given for the repayment phase. Thus, for \nexample, a creditor must provide payment information about the repayment phase as well as about the draw period, \nas required by \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). To the extent required disclosures are the same for the draw and repayment phase, \nthe creditor need not repeat such information, as long as it is clear that the information applies to both phases.\n\n4. Fixed-rate and -term payment plans during draw period. Home-equity plans typically offer a variable-rate feature \nduring the draw period. Specifically, withdrawals on a home-equity plan typically will access a general-revolving \nfeature to which a variable rate applies. Nonetheless, some home-equity plans also offer a fixed-rate and -term \npayment feature, where a consumer is permitted to repay all or part of the balance during the draw period at a fixed \nrate (rather than a variable rate) and over a specified time period. If a home-equity plan offers a variable-rate \nfeature and a fixed-rate and -term feature during the draw period, a creditor generally may not disclose in the table \nthe terms applicable to the fixed-rate and -term feature in making the disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(c), except as \nrequired under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(18). For example, the creditor would not be allowed to disclose in the table information \nabout the payment terms and the annual percentage rate applicable to the fixed-rate and -term payment feature, \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) and (c)(10), respectively. In this case, the creditor would only be allowed to disclose this \ninformation for the variable-rate feature; for the fixed-rate and -term feature, the creditor would be allowed to \ndisclose in the table only information specified in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(18). The creditor may, however, disclose additional \ninformation relating to the fixed-rate and -term feature outside of the table. See \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(v). If a home-equity \nplan does not offer a variable-rate feature during the draw period, but only offers fixed-rate and -term payment \nfeatures during the draw period, a creditor must disclose in the table information for the fixed-rate and -term \nfeatures when making the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.5b(c).\n\n\n\n5b(c)(1) Identification Information.\n\n1. Identification of creditor. The creditor making the disclosures must be identified. Use of the creditor's name is \nsufficient, but the creditor may also include an address and/or telephone number. In transactions with multiple \ncreditors, any one of them may make the disclosures; the one doing so must be identified.\n\n2. Multiple loan originators. In transactions with multiple loan originators, each loan originator's unique identifier \nmust be disclosed. For example, in a transaction where a mortgage broker meets the definition of a loan originator \nunder the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, Section 1503(3), 12 U.S.C. 5102(3), \nthe identifiers for the broker and for its employee originator meeting that definition must be disclosed.\n\n[5b(d)(1) Retention of Information.\n\n1. When disclosure not required. The creditor need not disclose that the consumer should make or otherwise retain \na copy of the disclosures if they are retainable-for example, if the disclosures are not part of an application that \nmust be returned to the creditor to apply for the plan.]\n\n5b(c)(4) [5b(d)(2).] Conditions for Disclosed Terms.\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(4)(i) [5b(d)(2)(i)]\n\n1. Guaranteed terms. [The requirement that the creditor disclose the time by which an application must be \nsubmitted to obtain the disclosed terms does not require the creditor to guarantee any terms.] If a creditor chooses \nnot to guarantee any terms, it must disclose that all of the terms are subject to change prior to opening the plan. \nThe creditor also is permitted to guarantee some terms and not others, but must indicate which terms are subject to \nchange.\n\n[2. Date for obtaining disclosed terms. The creditor may disclose either a specific date or a time period for obtaining \nthe disclosed terms. If the creditor discloses a time period, the consumer must be able to determine from the \ndisclosure the specific date by which an application must be submitted to obtain any guaranteed terms. For \nexample, the disclosure might read, \"To obtain the following terms, you must submit your application within 60 days \nafter the date appearing on this disclosure,\" provided the disclosure form also shows the date.]\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(4)(ii) [5b(d)(2)(ii)].\n\n1. Relation to other provisions. Creditors should consult the rules in \u00a7 226.5b(d) [\u00a7 226.5b(g)] regarding refund of \nfees when terms change.\n\n5b(c)(5) Refund of Fees Under \u00a7 226.5b(e).\n\n1. Relation to other provisions. Creditors should consult the rules in \u00a7 226.5b(e) regarding refund of fees if the \nconsumer rejects the plan within three business days of receiving the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.5b(b).\n\n5b(c)(7) [5b(d)(4)] Possible Actions by Creditor.\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(7)(i) [5b(d)(4)(i)].\n\n1. Fees imposed upon termination. This disclosure applies only to fees (such as penalty or prepayment fees) that \nthe creditor imposes if it terminates the plan prior to normal expiration. The disclosure does not apply to fees that \nare imposed either when the plan expires in accordance with the agreement or if the consumer terminates the plan \nprior to its scheduled maturity. In addition, the disclosure does not apply to fees associated with collection of the \ndebt, such as attorneys' fees and court costs, or to increases in the annual percentage rate linked to the consumer's \nfailure to make payments. The actual amount of the fee need not be disclosed.\n\n\n\n2. Changes to the plan [specified in the initial agreement]. If changes may occur pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i)-(v), a \ncreditor must state that the creditor can make changes to the plan. [certain changes will be implemented as \nspecified in the initial agreement].\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(7)(ii) [Paragraph 5b(d)(4)(iii)].\n\n1. Disclosure of conditions. A creditor may disclose the conditions under which a creditor may take certain actions \nas specified in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(7) either upon the consumer's request (prior to account opening) or with the disclosures \nrequired by \u00a7 226.5b(b). In making this disclosure, the creditor may provide a highlighted copy of the document that \ncontains such information, such as the contract or security agreement. The relevant items must be distinguished \nfrom the other information contained in the document. For example, the creditor may provide a cover sheet that \nspecifically points out which contract provisions contain the information, or may mark the relevant items on the \ndocument itself. As an alternative to disclosing the conditions in this manner, the creditor may simply describe the \nconditions using the language in \u00a7 [\u00a7 ] 226.5b(f)(2)(i)-[(iii)] (iv), [226.5b](f)(3)(i) (regarding freezing the line when the \nmaximum annual percentage rate is reached), and [226.5b](f)(3)(vi) or language that is substantially similar. [The \ncondition contained in \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iv) need not be stated.] In describing [specified] changes that may be \nimplemented during the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i)-(v), the creditor may provide a disclosure such as, \"We are \nallowed to make certain changes in the terms of the line, such as [Our agreement permits us to make certain] \nchanges [to the terms of the line] at specified times or upon the occurrence of specified events as set forth in the \ninitial agreement.\" See comment 5b(c)-2 regarding how soon after the consumer's request the creditor must \ndisclose this information to the consumer.\n\n[2. Form of disclosure. The list of conditions under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(4)(iii) may appear with the segregated disclosures or \napart from them. If the creditor elects to provide the list of conditions with the segregated disclosures, the list need \nnot comply with the precedence rule in \u00a7 226.5b(a)(2).]\n\n5b(c)(9) [5b(d)(5).] Payment Terms.\n\n1. Balloon payments. i. In general. Section 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and (iii) require disclosures of balloon payments. A \nballoon payment results if paying the minimum periodic payments does not fully amortize the outstanding balance \nby a specified date or time, and the consumer must repay the entire outstanding balance at such time. The creditor \nmust not make a disclosure about balloon payments if the final payment could not be more than twice the amount of \nother minimum payments under the plan. The balloon payment disclosures in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and (iii) do not apply \nin cases where repayment of the entire outstanding balance would occur only as a result of termination and \nacceleration.\n\nii. Terminology. In disclosing a balloon payment under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) and (iii), a creditor must disclose that a \nballoon payment \"may\" result if a balloon payment under a payment plan is possible, even if such a payment is \nuncertain or unlikely; a creditor must disclose that a balloon payment \"will\" result if a balloon payment will occur \nunder a payment plan, such as a payment plan with interest-only payments during the draw period and no \nrepayment period.\n\n2. Disclosing balloon payment when one payment plan is disclosed. If under the payment plan, paying only the \nminimum periodic payments may not repay any of the principal or may repay less than the outstanding balance by \nthe end of the plan, the creditor must disclose information about the balloon payment twice in the table--under \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A) and (c)(9)(iii)(C)(4). See the row \"Balloon Payment\" in the \"Borrowing and Repayment Terms\" \nsection of Sample G-14(D) for guidance on how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(A). See the \nfirst paragraph in the \"Sample Payments on a $ 80,000 Balance\" section of Sample G-14(D) for guidance on how \nto comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4).\n\n3. Disclosing balloon payments when two payment plans are disclosed. If under at least one of the payment plans, \npaying only the minimum periodic payments may not repay any of the principal or may repay less than the \noutstanding balance by the end of the plan, the creditor must disclose information about the balloon payment three \ntimes in the table--under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(1), (c)(9)(ii)(B)(3), and (c)(9)(iii)(C)(4). See the row \"Balloon Payment\" \n\n\n\nin the \"Borrowing and Repayment Terms\" section of Sample G-14(C) for guidance on how to comply with the \nrequirements in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(1). See the rows \"Plan A\" and \"Plan B\" in the \"Payment Plans\" section of \nSample G-14(C) for guidance on how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)(3). See the \"Plan A \nvs. Plan B\" part of the \"Plan Comparison: Sample Payments on an $ 80,000 Balance\" section of Sample G-14(C) \nfor guidance on how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(C)(4).\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(9)(i) [5b(d)(5)(i)]\n\n1. Length of the plan. [The combined length of the draw period and any repayment period need not be stated. If the \nlength of the repayment phase cannot be determined because, for example, it depends on the balance outstanding \nat the beginning of the repayment period, the creditor must state that the length are determined by the size of the \nbalance. If the length of the plan is indefinite (for example, because there is no time limit on the period during which \nthe consumer can take advances), the creditor must state that fact.] i. If a maturity date is set forth for the plan, the \nlength of the plan, the length of the draw period and the length of any repayment period are definite. The length of \nthe plan must be based on the maturity date of the plan, regardless of whether the outstanding balance will be paid \noff before or after the maturity date. For example, assume that a plan has a draw period of 10 years and a maturity \ndate of 20 years. If the outstanding balance on the plan is not paid off by the maturity date, the creditor will extend \nthe maturity date of the plan and require the consumer to make minimum payments until the outstanding balance is \nrepaid. In this example, the creditor must disclose the length of the plan as 20 years, the draw period as 10 years \nand the repayment period as 10 years, even though in some cases the maturity date of the plan may be extended \nin the future.\n\nii. If the plan does not have a maturity date and the length of the repayment period cannot be determined at the time \nthe disclosures required by \u00a7 226.5b(b) must be given because the length of the plan and the length of the \nrepayment period depend on the balance outstanding at the beginning of the repayment period or the balance at \nthe time of the last advance during the draw period, the creditor must state that the length of the plan and the length \nof the repayment period is determined by the size of the balance outstanding at the beginning of the repayment \nperiod or the balance at the time of the last advance during the draw period, as applicable. The following examples \nillustrate this rule:\n\nA. Assume the plan has no maturity date, the draw period is 10 years, and the minimum payment during the \nrepayment period is 1.5 percent of the outstanding balance at the time of the last advance during the draw period. \nIn this example, the creditor would disclose that the lengths of the plan and the repayment period are determined by \nthe size of the outstanding balance at the time of the last advance during the draw period.\n\nB. Assume the length of the draw period is 10 years and the length of the repayment period will be 15 years if the \nbalance at the beginning of the repayment period is less than $ 20,000 and 30 years if the balance is $ 20,000 or \nmore. In this example, the creditor must disclose that the length of the plan will be 25 or 40 years depending on the \noutstanding balance at the beginning of the repayment period. In addition, the creditor must disclose that the \nrepayment period will be 15 years if the balance is less than $ 20,000 and 30 years if the balance is $ 20,000 or \nmore. The creditor may not simply disclose that the repayment period is determined by the size of the balance. See \nSample G-14(E) for guidance on how to disclose this information.\n\niii. If the length of the plan is indefinite (for example, because there is no time limit on the period during which the \nconsumer can take advances), the creditor must state that fact.\n\n2. Renewal provisions. If, under the credit agreement, a creditor retains the right to review a line at the end of the \nspecified draw period and determine whether to renew or extend the draw period of the plan, the possibility of \nrenewal or extension--regardless of its likelihood--should be ignored for purposes of the disclosures. For example, if \nan agreement provides that the draw period is five years and that the creditor may renew the draw period for an \nadditional five years, the possibility of renewal should be ignored and the draw period should be considered five \nyears.\n\n\n\n3. Format. Under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(i), if the length of the plan is definite, a creditor must disclose the length of the plan, \nthe length of the draw period and the length of any repayment period in a format substantially similar to the format \nused in any of the applicable tables found in Samples G-14(C) and G-14(D). (See comment 5b(c)(9)(i)-1 for \nguidance on determining whether the length of the plan is definite.) Sample G-14(D) shows the format a creditor \nmust use for plans that have a definite length and have a draw period but no repayment period. Sample G-14(C) \nshows the format a creditor must use for plans that have a definite length and have a draw period and a repayment \nperiod. For example, in Sample G-14(C), the length of a plan is 20 years, and the length of the draw period and \nrepayment period are 10 years each. As shown in Sample G-14(C), the length of the plan must be disclosed as 20 \nyears, along with a statement indicating that this period is divided into two periods. In this example, the length of the \ndraw period must be disclosed as \"Years (1-10)\" and the length of the repayment period must be disclosed as \n\"Years (11-20).\" The length of the draw period and repayment period must be included with the headings \n\"Borrowing Period\" (for the draw period) and \"Repayment Period\" (for the repayment period), respectively, each \ntime these headings are used. See \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9) for when the headings must be used.\n\n4. Length of the plan and the length of the draw period are the same. If the length of the plan and the length of the \ndraw period are the same, a creditor will be deemed to satisfy the requirement to disclose the length of plan by \ndisclosing the length of the draw period.\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(9)(ii) [5b(d)(5)(ii)].\n\n1. Determination of the minimum periodic payment. This disclosure [must reflect] of how the minimum periodic \npayment is determined [, but] must [need only] describe only the principal and interest components of the payment. \nOther charges that may be part of the payment (as well as the balance computation method) must not be [may, but \nneed not, be] described under this provision. In addition, this disclosure must not include a description of any floor \npayment amount, where the payment will not go below this amount.\n\n2. Multiple payment plans. If a creditor only offers two payment plans (other than fixed-rate and -term payment \nplans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period), both of those payment options must \nbe disclosed in the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b). If a creditor offers more than two payment options (other than \nfixed-rate and -term payment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period), the \ncreditor pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B) must only disclose two of the payment plans in the table required by \u00a7 \n226.5b(b). The following would be considered two payment plans: The draw period is 10 years and the consumer \nhas the choice between two repayment periods--10 and 20 years. The two payment plans would be (1) a 10 year \ndraw period and a 10 year repayment period, and (2) a 10 year draw period and a 20 year repayment period.\n\n3. Statement about additional payment plans not disclosed in table. Section 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B) provides that if a \ncreditor offers more than the two payment plans described in the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b)(2)(i) (other than \nfixed-rate and -term payment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period), the \ncreditor must disclose that other payment plans are available, and the consumer should ask the creditor for \nadditional details about these other payment plans. This disclosure is required only if the creditor offers additional \npayment plans available to that consumer. If the only other payment plans available are employee preferred-rate \nplans, for example, the creditor must provide this statement only if the consumer would qualify for the employee \npreferred-rate plans.\n\n[2. Fixed rate and term payment options during draw period. If the home-equity plan permits the consumer to repay \nall or part of the balance during the draw period at a fixed rate (rather than a variable rate) and over a specified time \nperiod, this feature must be disclosed. To illustrate, a variable-rate plan may permit a consumer to elect during a \nten-year draw period to repay all or a portion of the balance over a three-year period at a fixed rate. The creditor \nmust disclose the rules relating to this feature including the period during which the option can be selected, the \nlength of time over which repayment can occur, any fees imposed for such a feature, and the specific rate or a \ndescription of the index and margin that will apply upon exercise of this choice. For example, the index and margin \ndisclosure might state: \"If you choose to convert any portion of your balance to a fixed rate, the rate will be the \nhighest prime rate published in the 'Wall Street Journal' that is in effect at the date of conversion plus a margin.\" If \n\n\n\nthe fixed rate is to be determined according to an index, it must be one that is outside the creditor's control and is \npublicly available in accordance with \u00a7 226.5b(f)(1). The effect of exercising the option should not be reflected \nelsewhere in the disclosures, such as in the historical example required in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xi).1\n\n(3] 4. Balloon payments. See comments 5b(c)(9)-1 through -3 for guidance on disclosing balloon payments under \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(ii). [In programs where the occurrence of a balloon payment is possible, the creditor must disclose the \npossibility of a balloon payment even if such a payment is uncertain or unlikely. In such cases, the disclosure might \nread, \"Your minimum payments may not be sufficient to fully repay the principal that is outstanding on your line. If \nthey are not, you will be required to pay the entire outstanding balance in a single payment.\" In programs where a \nballoon payment will occur, such as programs with interest-only payments during the draw period and no repayment \nperiod, the disclosures must state that fact. For example, the disclosure might read, \"Your minimum payments will \nnot repay the principal that is outstanding on your line. You will be required to pay the entire outstanding balance in \na single payment.\" In making this disclosure, the creditor is not required to use the term \"balloon payment.\" The \ncreditor also is not required to disclose the amount of the balloon payment. (See, however, the requirement under \u00a7 \n226.5b(d)(5)(iii).) The balloon payment disclosure does not apply in cases where repayment of the entire \noutstanding balance would occur only as a result of termination and acceleration. The creditor also need not make \na disclosure about balloon payments if the final payment could not be more than twice the amount of other \nminimum payments under the plan.]\n\n5. Consumer's request for additional information on other payment plans. If the creditor offers any other payment \nplans than the two payment plans disclosed in the table required under \u00a7 226.5b(b) (except for fixed-rate and -term \npayment plans unless those are the only payment plans offered during the draw period), and a consumer requests \nadditional information about this other plan prior to account opening, the creditor must disclose an additional table \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(b) to the consumer with the terms of the other payment plan described in the table. If the creditor \noffers multiple payment plans that were not disclosed in the table required under \u00a7 226.5b(b), only one payment \nplan may be disclosed on each additional table given to the consumer. For example, if a creditor offers two payment \nplans that were not disclosed in the table required under \u00a7 226.5b(b), the creditor must provide the consumer, upon \nrequest, two additional tables--one table for each payment plan. See comment 5b(c)-2 regarding how soon after \nthe consumer's request the creditor must disclose this information to the consumer.\n\n6. Reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse annuity or home-equity conversion mortgages, \nin addition to permitting the consumer to obtain advances, may involve the disbursement of monthly advances to \nthe consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrence of an event such as the consumer's death. Repayment of the \nreverse mortgage (generally a single payment of principal and accrued interest) may be required to be made at the \nend of the disbursements or, for example, upon the death of the consumer. In disclosing these plans, creditors must \napply the following rules, as applicable:\n\ni. If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for advances and disbursements but repayment is due only upon \noccurrence of a future event such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that disbursements will \nbe made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor must assume repayment will occur when disbursements end \n(or within a period following the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval between \ndisbursements). This assumption should be used even though repayment may occur before or after the \ndisbursements are scheduled to end. In such cases, the creditor may include a statement such as \"The disclosures \nassume that you will repay the line at the time the borrowing period and our payments to you end. As provided in \nyour agreement, your repayment may be required at a different time.\" The single payment should be considered \nthe \"minimum periodic payment\" and consequently would not be treated as a balloon payment. The examples of the \nminimum payment under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) should assume the consumer borrows the full credit line (as disclosed in \n\u00a7 226.5b(c)(17)) at the beginning of the draw period.\n\nii. If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period for advances or disbursements nor a specified repayment \ndate and these terms will be determined solely by reference to future events, including the consumer's death, the \ncreditor may assume that the draws and disbursements will end upon the consumer's death (estimated by using \nactuarial tables, for example) and that repayment will be required at the same time (or within a period following the \n\n\n\ndate of the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval for disbursements). Alternatively, the \ncreditor may base the disclosures upon another future event it estimates will be most likely to occur first. (If terms \nwill be determined by reference to future events which do not include the consumer's death, the creditor must base \nthe disclosures upon the occurrence of the event estimated to be most likely to occur first.)\n\niii. In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume that all draws and disbursements and accrued interest will \nbe paid by the consumer. For example, if the note has a non-recourse provision providing that the consumer is not \nobligated for an amount greater than the value of the house, the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full \namount to be drawn or disbursed will be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may include a statement such as \n\"The disclosures assume full repayment of the amount advanced plus accrued interest, although the amount you \nmay be required to pay is limited by your agreement.\"\n\niv. Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property will be shared \nbetween the consumer and the creditor. The creditor must disclose the appreciation feature, including describing \nhow the creditor's share will be determined, any limitations, and when the feature may be exercised.\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(9)(iii) [5b(d)(5)(iii)].\n\n1. Minimum periodic payment examples. A creditor must provide examples for each payment option disclosed in the \ntable pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii). In calculating the payment examples, a creditor must take into account any \nsignificant terms related to each payment option, such as any payment caps or payment floor amounts. (A creditor \nmust take payment floor amounts into account when calculating the payment examples even though the creditor \nmay not disclose that payment floor in the table when describing how minimum payments will be calculated. See \ncomment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-1.) For example, assume that under a payment plan, the monthly payment for the draw period \nwill be calculated as the interest accrued during that month, or $ 50, whichever is greater. In the table described in \u00a7 \n226.5b(b), a creditor must disclose that the minimum monthly payment during the draw period only covers interest. \nThe creditor must not disclose in the table the payment floor of $ 50. Nonetheless, the creditor must take into \naccount this $ 50 payment floor in calculating the disclosures shown as part of the payment examples. In disclosing \nthe payment examples, the creditor must assume that the consumer borrows the full credit line (as disclosed in \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(17)) at the beginning of the draw period and that this advance is reduced according to the terms of the \nplan. The creditor must not assume that an additional advance is taken at any time, including at the beginning of \nany repayment period. A creditor must assume that the annual percentage rate used to calculate each payment \nexample required by \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) will remain the same during the draw period and any repayment period as \nspecified in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(A)(3) even if that annual percentage rate is a variable rate under the plan. [may \nassume that the credit limit as well as the outstanding balance is $ 10,000 if such an assumption is relevant to \ncalculating payments. (If the creditor only offers lines of credit for less than $ 10,000, the creditor may assume an \noutstanding balance of $ 5,000 instead of $ 10,000 in making this disclosure.)] The examples should reflect the \npayment comprised only of principal and interest. The sample payments in the table showing the first minimum \nperiodic payment for the draw period and any repayment period, and the balance outstanding at the beginning of \nany repayment period, must be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. [Creditors may provide an additional example \nreflecting other charges that may be included in the payment, such as credit insurance premiums.] Creditors may \nassume that all months have an equal number of days, that payments are collected in whole cents, and that \npayments will fall on a business day even though they may be due on a non-business day. [For variable-rate plans, \nthe example must be based on the last rate in the historical example required in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xi), or a more \nrecent rate. In cases where the last rate shown in the historical example is different from the index value and \nmargin (for example, due to a rate cap), creditors should calculate the rate by using the index value and margin. A \ndiscounted rate may not be considered a more recent rate in calculating this payment example for either variable- \nor fixed-rate plans.]\n\n[2. Representative examples. In plans with multiple payment options within the draw period or within any repayment \nperiod, the creditor may provide representative examples as an alternative to providing examples for each payment \noption. The creditor may elect to provide representative payment examples based on three categories of payment \noptions. The first category consists of plans that permit minimum payment of only accrued finance charges (interest \n\n\n\nonly plans). The second category includes plans in which a fixed percentage or a fixed fraction of the outstanding \nbalance or credit limit (for example, 2% of the balance or 1/180th of the balance) is used to determine the minimum \npayment. The third category includes all other types of minimum payment options, such as a specified dollar \namount plus any accrued finance charges. Creditors may classify their minimum payment arrangements within one \nof these three categories even if other features exist, such as varying lengths of a draw or repayment period, \nrequired payment of past due amounts, late charges, and minimum dollar amounts. The creditor may use a single \nexample within each category to represent the payment options in that category. For example, if a creditor permits \nminimum payments of 1%, 2%, 3% or 4% of the outstanding balance, it may pick one of these four options and \nprovide the example required under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) for that option alone.\n\nThe example used to represent a category must be an option commonly chosen by consumers, or a typical or \nrepresentative example. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12) (x) and (xi) for a discussion of the use of \nrepresentative examples for making those disclosures. Creditors using a representative example within each \ncategory must use the same example for purposes of the disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12)(x) and \n(xi).) Creditors may use representative examples under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5) only with respect to the payment example \nrequired under paragraph (d)(5)(iii). Creditors must provide a full narrative description of all payment options under \n\u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(i) and (ii).\n\n3. Examples for draw and repayment periods. Separate examples must be given for the draw and repayment \nperiods unless the payments are determined the same way during both periods. In setting forth payment examples \nfor any repayment period under this section (and the historical example under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xi)), creditors should \nassume a $ 10,000 advance is taken at the beginning of the draw period and is reduced according to the terms of \nthe plan. Creditors should not assume an additional advance is taken at any time, including at the beginning of any \nrepayment period.]\n\n2. Balloon payments. See comments 5b(c)(9)-1 through -3 for guidance on disclosing balloon payments under \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(iii)(D).\n\n3. [4.] Reverse mortgages. See comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-6 for guidance on providing the payment examples required \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) for reverse mortgages. [Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse annuity or home-equity \nconversion mortgages, in addition to permitting the consumer to obtain advances, may involve the disbursement of \nmonthly advances to the consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrence of an event such as the consumer's \ndeath. Repayment of the reverse mortgage (generally a single payment of principal and accrued interest) may be \nrequired to be made at the end of the disbursements or, for example, upon the death of the consumer. In disclosing \nthese plans, creditors must apply the following rules, as applicable:\n\ni. If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for advances and disbursements but repayment is due only upon \noccurrence of a future event such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that disbursements will \nbe made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor must assume repayment will occur when disbursements end \n(or within a period following the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval between \ndisbursements). This assumption should be used even though repayment may occur before or after the \ndisbursements are scheduled to end. In such cases, the creditor may include a statement such as \"The disclosures \nassume that you will repay the line at the time the draw period and our payments to you end. As provided in your \nagreement, your repayment may be required at a different time.\" The single payment should be considered the \n\"minimum periodic payment\" and consequently would not be treated as a balloon payment. The example of the \nminimum payment under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) should assume a single $ 10,000 draw.\n\nii. If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period for advances or disbursements nor a specified repayment \ndate and these terms will be determined solely by reference to future events, including the consumer's death, the \ncreditor may assume that the draws and disbursements will end upon the consumer's death (estimated by using \nactuarial tables, for example) and that repayment will be required at the same time (or within a period following the \ndate of the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval for disbursements). Alternatively, the \ncreditor may base the disclosures upon another future event it estimates will be most likely to occur first. (If terms \n\n\n\nwill be determined by reference to future events which do not include the consumer's death, the creditor must base \nthe disclosures upon the occurrence of the event estimated to be most likely to occur first.)\n\niii. In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume that all draws and disbursements and accrued interest will \nbe paid by the consumer. For example, if the note has a non-recourse provision providing that the consumer is not \nobligated for an amount greater than the value of the house, the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full \namount to be drawn or disbursed will be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may include a statement such as \n\"The disclosures assume full repayment of the amount advanced plus accrued interest, although the amount you \nmay be required to pay is limited by your agreement.\"\n\niv. Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property will be shared \nbetween the consumer and the creditor. The creditor must disclose the appreciation feature, including describing \nhow the creditor's share will be determined, any limitations, and when the feature may be exercised.]\n\n5b(c)(10) [5b(d)(6)] Annual Percentage Rate.\n\n1. Rates disclosed. The only rates that may be disclosed in the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b) are annual percentage \nrates determined under \u00a7 226.14(b). Periodic rates must not be disclosed in the table.\n\n2. Rate changes set forth in initial agreement. This paragraph requires disclosure of the rate changes set forth in \nthe initial agreement, as discussed in \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i), that are applicable to the payment plans disclosed pursuant \nto \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). For example, this paragraph requires disclosure of preferred-rate provisions, where the rate will \nincrease upon the occurrence of some event, such as the borrower-employee leaving the creditor's employ or the \nconsumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor. The creditor must disclose the preferred rate that \napplies to the plan, and the rate that would apply if the event is triggered, such as the borrower-employee leaving \nthe creditor's employ or the consumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor. If the preferred rate and \nthe rate that would apply if the event is triggered are variable rates, the creditor must disclose those rates based on \nthe applicable index or formula, and disclose other information required by \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i).\n\n3. Rates applicable to payment plans disclosed. A creditor is only required to disclose the rates applicable to the \npayment plans that are disclosed in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9). If the creditor offers other payment plans than the ones \ndisclosed in the table required under \u00a7 226.5b(b), and a consumer requests additional information about those other \nplans, the creditor must disclose the annual percentage rates applicable to those other plans (as well as other \ninformation) when disclosing those other payment plans to the consumer. See comment 5b(c)(9)(ii)-5 and comment \n5b(c)(18)-2 for the information a creditor must provide to a consumer that requests additional information about \nother payment plans offered by the creditor.\n\n[1. Preferred-rate plans. If a creditor offers a preferential fixed-rate plan in which the rate will increase a specified \namount upon the occurrence of a specified event, the creditor must disclose the specific amount the rate will \nincrease.]\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(10)(i) Disclosures for Variable-rate Plans.\n\n1. Variable-rate accounts--definition. For purposes of \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i), a variable-rate account exists when rate \nchanges are part of the plan and are tied to an index or formula. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.6(a)(4)(ii)-1 for \nexamples of variable-rate plans.)\n\n2. Variable-rate accounts--fact that the rate varies and how the rate will be determined. In describing how the \napplicable rate will be determined, the creditor must identify in the table described in \u00a7 226.5b(b) the type of index \nused and the amount of any margin. In describing the index, a creditor may not include in the table details about the \nindex. For example, if a creditor uses a prime rate, the creditor must disclose the rate as a \"prime rate\" and may not \ndisclose in the table other details about the prime rate, such as the fact that it is the highest prime rate published in \nthe Wall Street Journal two business days before the closing date of the statement for each billing period. Except as \npermitted by \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(6), a creditor may not disclose in the table the current value of the index (such as \n\n\n\nthat the prime rate is currently 7.5 percent). See Samples G-14(C), G-14(D) and G-14(E) for guidance on how to \ndisclose the fact that the applicable rate varies and how it is determined.\n\n3. Rate during any repayment period. If a creditor uses an index to determine the rate that will apply at the time of \nconversion to the repayment phase--even if the rate will thereafter be fixed--the creditor must provide the \ninformation in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i), as applicable.\n\n4. Limitations on increases in rates. The creditor must disclose in the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b) any limitations \non increases in the annual percentage rate, including the minimum and maximum annual percentage rate that may \nbe imposed under each payment plan disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii). For example, a creditor must disclose any \nrate limitations that occur every two years, annually or on less than an annual basis. If the creditor bases its rate \nlimitation on 12 monthly billing cycles, such a limitation must be treated as an annual cap. Rate limitations imposed \non more or less than an annual basis must be stated in terms of a specific amount of time. For example, if the \ncreditor imposes rate limitations on only a semiannual basis, this must be expressed as a rate limitation for a six-\nmonth time period. If the creditor does not impose annual or other periodic limitations on rate increases, the fact \nmust be stated in the table described in \u00a7 226.5b(b).\n\n5. Maximum limitations on increases in rates. The maximum annual percentage rate that may be imposed under \neach payment option disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii) over the term of the plan (including the draw period and any \nrepayment period provided for in the initial agreement) must be provided in the table described in \u00a7 226.5b(b). If \nseparate overall limitations apply to rate increases resulting from events such as leaving the creditor's employ, \nthose limitations also must be stated. Limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings \nunder state or federal statutes or regulations.\n\n6. Sample forms. Samples G-14(C), G-14(D) and G-14(E) provide illustrative guidance on the variable-rate rules.\n\nParagraph 5b(c)(10)(ii) Introductory Initial Rate.\n\n1. Preferred rates. If a creditor offers a preferred rate that will increase a specified amount upon the occurrence of a \nspecified event other than the expiration of a specific time period, such as the borrower-employee leaving the \ncreditor's employ, the preferred rate is not an introductory rate under \u00a7 226.5b(C)(10)(ii), but must be disclosed in \naccordance with \u00a7 226.5b(C)(10). See comment 5b(C)(10)-2.\n\n2. Immediate proximity. i. In general. If the term \"introductory\" is in the same phrase as the introductory rate, it will \nbe deemed to be in immediate proximity of the listing. For example, a creditor that uses the phrase \"introductory \nAPR X percent\" has used the word \"introductory\" within the same phrase as the rate. (See. Samples G-14(C) and \nG-14(E) for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the expiration date of the introductory rate and \nthe rate that will apply after the introductory rate expires, if an introductory rate is disclosed in the table.)\n\nii. More than one introductory rate. If more than one introductory rate may apply to a particular balance in \nsucceeding periods, the term \"introductory\" need only be used to describe the first introductory rate. For example, if \na creditor offers an introductory rate of 8.99% on the plan for six months, and an introductory rate of 10.99% for the \nfollowing six months, the term \"introductory\" need only be used to describe the 8.99% rate.\n\n3. Rate that applies after introductory rate expires. If the initial rate is an introductory rate, the creditor must disclose \nthe introductory rate, how long the introductory rate will remain in effect, and the rate that would otherwise apply to \nthe plan. Where the rate that would otherwise apply is fixed, the creditor must disclose the rate that will apply after \nthe introductory rate expires. Where the rate that would otherwise apply is variable, the creditor must disclose the \nrate based on the applicable index or formula, and disclose the other variable-rate disclosures required under \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(10)(i).\n\n5b(c)(11) [5b(d)(7)] Fees Imposed by Creditor and Third Parties to Open the Plan.\n\n\n\n1. Applicability. Section 226.5b(c)(11) applies only to one-time fees imposed by the creditor or third parties to open \nthe plan. The fees referred to in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) include items such as application fees, points, appraisal or other \nproperty valuation fees, credit report fees, government agency fees, and attorneys' fees. Annual fees or other \nperiodic fees that may be imposed for the availability of the plan would not be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11), but \nmust be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12). A creditor must not state the amount of any property insurance premiums \nin the table, even in cases where property insurance is required by the creditor. [The fees referred to in section \n226.5b(d)(7) include items such as application fees, points, annual fees, transaction fees, fees to obtain checks to \naccess the plan, and fees imposed for converting to a repayment phase that is provided for in the original \nagreement. This disclosure includes any fees that are imposed by the creditor to use or maintain the plan, whether \nthe fees are kept by the creditor or a third party. For example, if a creditor requires an annual credit report on the \nconsumer and requires the consumer to pay this fee to the creditor or directly to the third party, the fee must be \nspecifically stated. Third party fees to open the plan that are initially paid by the consumer to the creditor may be \nincluded in this disclosure or in the disclosure under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(8).]\n\n2. Manner of describing itemized fees. Section 226.5b(d)(11) provides that if the dollar amount of a one-time \naccount opening fee is not known at the time the disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(b) are delivered or mailed, a creditor \nmust provide a range for such fee. If a range is shown, the highest amount of the fee in that range must assume \nthat the consumer will borrow the full credit line at account opening. The lowest amount of the fee in the range must \nbe the lowest amount of the fee that may be imposed. [Charges may be stated as an estimated dollar amount for \neach fee, or as a percentage of a typical or representative amount of credit. The creditor may provide a stepped fee \nschedule in which a fee will increase a specified amount at a specified date. (See the discussion contained in the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i).)]\n\n3. Fees not required to be disclosed. Fees that are not imposed to open [, use, or maintain] a plan, such as fees for \nresearching an account, photocopying, paying late, stopping payment, having a check returned, exceeding the \ncredit limit, or closing out an account, do not have to be disclosed under this section. Credit report and property \nvaluation [appraisal] fees imposed to investigate whether a condition permitting a freeze continues to exist--as \ndiscussed in 226.5b(g)(3)(iv) and accompanying commentary [the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)]--are not \nrequired to be disclosed under this section [or \u00a7 226.5b(d)(8)].\n\n4. Rebates of account opening fees [closing costs]. If one-time fees for account opening [closing costs] are imposed \nthey must be disclosed, regardless of whether such costs may be rebated later (for example, rebated to the extent \nof any interest paid during the first year of the plan).\n\n[5. Terms used in disclosure. Creditors need not use the terms finance charge or other charge in describing the \nfees imposed by the creditor under this section or those imposed by third parties, as applicable, under section \n226.5b(d)(8).]\n\n5. Disclosure of itemized list of fees to open a plan. A creditor will be deemed to provide the itemization of the \naccount-opening fees clearly and conspicuously if the creditor provides this information in a bullet format as shown \nin Samples G-14(C), G-14(D) and G-14(E).\n\n5(b)(c)(12) Fees Imposed by the Creditor for Availability of the Plan.\n\n1. Fee to obtain access devices. The fees referred to in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) include fees to obtain access devices, such \nas fees to obtain checks or credit cards to access the plan. For example, a fee to obtain checks or a credit card on \nthe account must be disclosed in the table as a fee for issuance or availability under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12). This fee must \nbe disclosed even if the fee is optional; that is, if the fee is charged only if the consumer requests checks or a credit \ncard.\n\n2. Fees kept by third party. The fees referred to in \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) include any fees that are imposed by the creditor \nfor the availability of the plan, whether the fees are kept by the creditor or a third party. For example, if a creditor \nrequires an annual credit report on the consumer and requires the consumer to pay this fee to the creditor or \ndirectly to the third party, the fee must be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12).\n\n\n\n3. Waived or reduced fees. If fees required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(12) are waived or reduced for a \nlimited time, the introductory fees or the fact of fee waivers may be provided in the table in addition to the required \nfees if the creditor also discloses how long the reduced fees or waivers will remain in effect.\n\n5b(c)(13) Fees Imposed by the Creditor for Early Termination of the Plan by the Consumer.\n\n1. Applicability. This disclosure applies to fees (such as penalty or prepayment fees) that the creditor imposes if the \nconsumer terminates the plan prior to its scheduled maturity. This disclosure includes waived account-opening fees \nfor the plan, if the creditor will impose those costs on the consumer if the consumer terminates the plan within a \ncertain amount of time after account opening. The disclosure does not apply to fees that the creditor may impose in \nlieu of termination under comment 5b(f)(2)-2. The disclosure also does not apply to fees that are imposed when the \nplan expires in accordance with the agreement or that are associated with collection of the debt if the creditor \nterminates the plan, such as attorneys' fees and court costs.\n\n5b(c)(14) Statement about Other Fees.\n\n1. Disclosure of additional information upon request. A creditor generally must include in the table required by \u00a7 \n226.5b(b) a statement that the consumer may receive, upon request, additional information about fees applicable to \nthe plan. Alternatively, a creditor may provide additional information about fees applicable to the plan along with the \ntable required by \u00a7 226.5b(b). In that case, the creditor must disclose in the table that is required by \u00a7 226.5b(b) that \nadditional information about fees applicable to the plan is enclosed with the table. In providing additional information \nabout fees to a consumer upon the consumer's request prior to account opening (or along with the table required \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(b)), a creditor must disclose the penalty and transaction fees that are required to be disclosed under \n\u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(x) through (xiv) and a statement that other fees may apply. A creditor must use a tabular format to \ndisclose the additional information about fees that is provided upon request or provided with the table required by \u00a7 \n226.5b(b). See comment 5b(c)-2 regarding how soon after the consumer's request the creditor must disclose this \ninformation to the consumer.-411\n\n[5b(d)(8) Fees Imposed by Third Parties to Open a Plan.\n\n1. Applicability. Section 226.5b(d)(8) applies only to fees imposed by third parties to open the plan. Thus, for \nexample, this section does not require disclosure of a fee imposed by a government agency at the end of a plan to \nrelease a security interest. Fees to be disclosed include appraisal, credit report, government agency, and attorneys' \nfees. In cases where property insurance is required by the creditor, the creditor either may disclose the amount of \nthe premium or may state that property insurance is required. For example, the disclosure might state, \"You must \ncarry insurance on the property that secures this plan.\"\n\n2. Itemization of third-party fees. In all cases creditors must state the total of third-party fees as a single dollar \namount or a range except that the total need not include costs for property insurance if the creditor discloses that \nsuch insurance is required. A creditor has two options with regard to providing the more detailed information about \nthird party fees. Creditors may provide a statement that the consumer may request more specific cost information \nabout third party fees from the creditor. As an alternative to including this statement, creditors may provide an \nitemization of such fees (by type and amount) with the early disclosures. Any itemization provided upon the \nconsumer's request need not include a disclosure about property insurance.\n\n3. Manner of describing fees. A good faith estimate of the amount of fees must be provided. Creditors may provide, \nbased on a typical or representative amount of credit, a range for such fees or state the dollar amount of such fees. \nFees may be expressed on a unit cost basis, for example, $ 5 per $ 1,000 of credit.\n\n4. Rebates of third party fees. Even if fees imposed by third parties may be rebated, they must be disclosed. (See \nthe commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7).)]\n\n5b(c)(15) 5b(d)(9)] Negative Amortization.\n\n\n\n1. Disclosure required. In transactions where the minimum payment will not or may not be sufficient to cover the \ninterest that accrues on the outstanding balance, the creditor must disclose that negative amortization will or may \noccur. This disclosure is required whether or not the unpaid interest is added to the outstanding balance upon which \ninterest is computed. A disclosure is not required merely because a loan calls for non-amortizing or partially \namortizing payments. A creditor will be deemed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b(c)(15) by providing the \nfollowing disclosure, as applicable: \"Your minimum payment may cover/ covers only part of the interest you owe \neach month and none of the principal. The unpaid interest will be added to your loan amount, which over time will \nincrease the total amount you are borrowing and cause you to lose equity in your home.\"\n\n5b(c)(16) [5b(d)(10)] Transaction Requirements.\n\n1. Applicability. A limitation on automated teller machine usage need not be disclosed under this paragraph unless \nthat is the only means by which the consumer can obtain funds.\n\n5b(c)(18) Statements About Fixed-Rate and -Term Payment Plans.\n\n1. Disclosure of fixed-rate and -term payment plans in the table. See comment 5b(c)-4 regarding disclosure of terms \nrelating to fixed-rate and -term payment plans during the draw period in the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b).\n\n2. Disclosure of additional information upon request. A creditor generally must disclose in the table required by \u00a7 \n226.5b(b) a statement that the consumer may receive, upon request, further details about the fixed-rate and -term \npayment plans. Alternatively, a creditor may provide additional detail about the fixed-rate and -term payment plans \nwith the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b). In that case, the creditor must state that information about the fixed-rate and \n-term payment plans are provided along with the table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b). In disclosing additional information \nabout the fixed-rate and -term payment plans upon a consumer's request prior to account opening (or along with \nthe table required by \u00a7 226.5b(b)), a creditor must disclose in the form of a table (1) the information described by \u00a7 \n226.5b(c) applicable to the fixed-rate and -term payment plans, and (2) any fees imposed related to the use of the \nfixed-rate and -term payment plans, such as fees to exercise the fixed-rate and -term payment plans or to convert a \nbalance under a fixed-rate and -term payment feature to a variable-rate feature under the HELOC plan. See \ncomment 5b(c)-2 regarding how soon after the consumer's request the creditor must disclose this information to the \nconsumer.\n\n5b(c)(19) Required Insurance, Debt Cancellation, or Debt Suspension Coverage.\n\n1. Content. See Samples G-14(D) and G-14(E) for guidance on how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(19).\n\n[5b(d)(12) Disclosures for Variable-Rate Plans.\n\n1. Variable-rate provisions. Sample forms in appendix G-14 provide illustrative guidance on the variable-rate rules.\n\nParagraph 5b(d)(12)(iv).\n\n1. Determination of annual percentage rate. If the creditor adjusts its index through the addition of a margin, the \ndisclosure might read, \"Your annual percentage rate is based on the index plus a margin.\" The creditor is not \nrequired to disclose a specific value for the margin.\n\nParagraph 5b(d)(12)(viii).\n\n1. Preferred-rate provisions. This paragraph requires disclosure of preferred-rate provisions, where the rate will \nincrease upon the occurrence of some event, such as the borrower-employee leaving the creditor's employ or the \nconsumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor.\n\n2. Provisions on conversion to fixed rates. The commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) discusses the disclosure \nrequirements for options permitting the consumer to convert from a variable rate to a fixed rate.\n\n\n\nParagraph 5b(d)(12)(ix).\n\n1. Periodic limitations on increases in rates. The creditor must disclose any annual limitations on increases in the \nannual percentage rate. If the creditor bases its rate limitation on 12 monthly billing cycles, such a limitation should \nbe treated as an annual cap. Rate limitations imposed on less than an annual basis must be stated in terms of a \nspecific amount of time. For example, if the creditor imposes rate limitations on only a semiannual basis, this must \nbe expressed as a rate limitation for a six-month time period. If the creditor does not impose periodic limitations \n(annual or shorter) on rate increases, the fact that there are no annual rate limitations must be stated.\n\n2. Maximum limitations on increases in rates. The maximum annual percentage rate that may be imposed under \neach payment option over the term of the plan (including the draw period and any repayment period provided for in \nthe initial agreement) must be provided. The creditor may disclose this rate as a specific number (for example 18%) \nor as a specific amount above the initial rate. For example, this disclosure might read, \"The maximum annual \npercentage rate that can apply to your line will be 5 percentage points above your initial rate.\" If the creditor states \nthe maximum rate as a specific amount above the initial rate, the creditor must include a statement that the \nconsumer should inquire about the rate limitations that are currently available. If an initial discount is not taken into \naccount in applying maximum rate limitations, that fact must be disclosed. If separate overall limitations apply to \nrate increases resulting from events such as the exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option or leaving the creditor's \nemploy, those limitations also must be stated. Limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate \nceilings under state or federal statutes or regulations.\n\n3. Form of disclosures. The creditor need not disclose each periodic or maximum rate limitation that is currently \navailable. Instead, the creditor may disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodic and maximum rate \nlimitations that may be applicable to the creditor's home-equity plans. Creditors using this alternative must include a \nstatement that the consumer should inquire about the rate limitations that are currently available.\n\nParagraph 5b(d)(12)(x).\n\n1. Maximum rate payment example. In calculating the payment creditors should assume the maximum rate is in \neffect. Any discounted or premium initial rates or periodic rate limitations should be ignored for purposes of this \ndisclosure. If a range is used to disclose the maximum cap under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), the highest rate in the range \nmust be used for the disclosure under this paragraph. As an alternative to making disclosures based on each \npayment option, the creditor may choose a representative example within the three categories of payment options \nupon which to base this disclosure. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5).) However, separate examples must be \nprovided for the draw period and for any repayment period unless the payment is determined the same way in both \nperiods. Creditors should calculate the example for the repayment period based on an assumed $ 10,000 balance. \n(See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5) for a discussion of the circumstances in which a creditor may use a lower \noutstanding balance.)\n\n2. Time the maximum rate could be reached. In stating the date or time when the maximum rate could be reached, \ncreditors should assume the rate increases as rapidly as possible under the plan. In calculating the date or time, \ncreditors should factor in any discounted or premium initial rates and periodic rate limitations. This disclosure must \nbe provided for the draw phase and any repayment phase. Creditors should assume the index and margin shown \nin the last year of the historical example (or a more recent rate) is in effect at the beginning of each phase.\n\nParagraph 5b(d)(12)(xi).\n\n1. Index movement. Index values and annual percentage rates must be shown for the entire 15 years of the \nhistorical example and must be based on the most recent 15 years. The example must be updated annually to \nreflect the most recent 15 years of index values as soon as reasonably possible after the new index value becomes \navailable. If the values for an index have not been available for 15 years, a creditor need only go back as far as the \nvalues have been available and may start the historical example at the year for which values are first available.\n\n\n\n2. Selection of index values. The historical example must reflect the method of choosing index values for the plan. \nFor example, if an average of index values is used in the plan, averages must be used in the example, but if an \nindex value as of a particular date is used, a single index value must be shown. The creditor is required to assume \none date (or one period, if an average is used) within a year on which to base the history of index values. The \ncreditor may choose to use index values as of any date or period as long as the index value as of this date or period \nis used for each year in the example. Only one index value per year need be shown, even if the plan provides for \nadjustments to the annual percentage rate or payment more than once in a year. In such cases, the creditor can \nassume that the index rate remained constant for the full year for the purpose of calculating the annual percentage \nrate and payment.\n\n3. Selection of margin. A value for the margin must be assumed in order to prepare the example. A creditor may \nselect a representative margin that it has used with the index during the six months preceding preparation of the \ndisclosures and state that the margin is one that it has used recently. The margin selected may be used until the \ncreditor annually updates the disclosure form to reflect the most recent 15 years of index values.\n\n4. Amount of discount or premium. In reflecting any discounted or premium initial rate, the creditor may select a \ndiscount or premium that it has used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and should \ndisclose that the discount or premium is one that the creditor has used recently. The discount or premium should be \nreflected in the example for as long as it is in effect. The creditor may assume that a discount or premium that \nwould have been in effect for any part of a year was in effect for the full year for purposes of reflecting it in the \nhistorical example.\n\n5. Rate limitations. Limitations on both periodic and maximum rates must be reflected in the historical example. If \nranges of rate limitations are provided under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), the highest rates provided in those ranges must be \nused in the example. Rate limitations that may apply more often than annually should be treated as if they were \nannual limitations. For example, if a creditor imposes a 1% cap every six months, this should be reflected in the \nexample as if it were a 2% annual cap.\n\n6. Assumed advances. The creditor should assume that the $ 10,000 balance is an advance taken at the beginning \nof the first billing cycle and is reduced according to the terms of the plan, and that the consumer takes no \nsubsequent draws. As discussed in the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5), creditors should not assume an additional \nadvance is taken at the beginning of any repayment period. If applicable, the creditor may assume the $ 10,000 is \nboth the advance and the credit limit. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5) for a discussion of the circumstances \nin which a creditor may use a lower outstanding balance.)\n\n7. Representative payment options. The creditor need not provide an historical example for all of its various \npayment options, but may select a representative payment option within each of the three categories of payments \nupon which to base its disclosure. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5).)\n\n8. Payment information. The payment figures in the historical example must reflect all significant program terms. \nFor example, features such as rate and payment caps, a discounted initial rate, negative amortization, and rate \ncarryover must be taken into account in calculating the payment figures if these would have applied to the plan. The \nhistorical example should include payments for as much of the length of the plan as would occur during a 15-year \nperiod. For example:\n\n. If the draw period is 10 years and the repayment period is 15 years, the example should illustrate the entire 10-\nyear draw period and the first 5 years of the repayment period.\n\n. If the length of the draw period is 15 years and there is a 15-year repayment phase, the historical example must \nreflect the payments for the 15-year draw period and would not show any of the repayment period. No additional \nhistorical example would be required to reflect payments for the repayment period.\n\n\n\n. If the length of the plan is less than 15 years, payments in the historical example need only be shown for the \nnumber of years in the term. In such cases, however, the creditor must show the index values, margin and annual \npercentage rates and continue to reflect all significant plan terms such as rate limitations for the entire 15 years.\n\nA creditor need show only a single payment per year in the example, even though payments may vary during a \nyear. The calculations should be based on the actual payment computation formula, although the creditor may \nassume that all months have an equal number of days. The creditor may assume that payments are made on the \nlast day of the billing cycle, the billing date or the payment due date, but must be consistent in the manner in which \nthe period used to illustrate payment information is selected. Information about balloon payments and remaining \nbalance may, but need not, be reflected in the example.\n\n9. Disclosures for repayment period. The historical example must reflect all features of the repayment period, \nincluding the appropriate index values, margin, rate limitations, length of the repayment period, and payments. For \nexample, if different indices are used during the draw and repayment periods, the index values for that portion of \nthe 15 years that reflect the repayment period must be the values for the appropriate index.\n\n10. Reverse mortgages. The historical example for reverse mortgages should reflect 15 years of index values and \nannual percentage rates, but the payment column should be blank until the year that the single payment will be \nmade, assuming that payment is estimated to occur within 15 years. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5) for a \ndiscussion of reverse mortgages.)\n\n5b(e) Brochure\n\n1. Substitutes. A brochure is a suitable substitute for the Board's home-equity brochure if it is, at a minimum, \ncomparable to the Board's brochure in substance and comprehensiveness. Creditors are permitted to provide more \ndetailed information than is contained in the Board's brochure.\n\n2. Effect of third-party delivery of brochure. If a creditor determines that a third party has provided a consumer with \nthe required brochure pursuant to section 226.5b(c), the creditor need not give the consumer a second brochure.]\n\n5b[(g)] (d) Refund of Fees\n\n1. Refund of fees required. If any disclosed term, including any term provided upon request pursuant to section \n226.5b (c) [(d)], changes between the time the early disclosures are provided to the consumer and the time the plan \nis opened, and the consumer [as a result] decides to not enter into the plan, a creditor must refund all fees paid by \nthe consumer [in connection with the application]. All fees, including credit-report fees and appraisal fees, must be \nrefunded whether such fees are paid to the creditor or directly to third parties. A consumer is entitled to a refund of \nfees under these circumstances whether or not terms are guaranteed by the creditor under section 226.5b(c)(4)(i) \n[(d)(2)(i)].\n\n2. Variable-rate plans. The right to a refund of fees does not apply to changes in the annual percentage rate \nresulting from fluctuations in the index value in a variable-rate plan. Also, if the maximum annual percentage rate is \n[expressed as] an amount over the initial rate, the right to refund of fees would not apply to changes in the cap \nresulting from fluctuations in the index value.\n\n3. Changes in terms. If a term, such as a fee [the maximum rate], is stated as a range in the early disclosures \nrequired under \u00a7 226.5b(b), and the term ultimately applicable to the plan falls within that range, a change does not \noccur for purposes of this section. If, however, no range is used and the term is changed (for example, a rate cap of \n6 rather than 5 percentage points over the initial rate), the change would permit the consumer to obtain a refund of \nfees. If a fee imposed by the creditor is stated in the early disclosures as an estimate and the fee changes, the \nconsumer could elect to not enter into the agreement and would be entitled to a refund of fees. [On the other hand, \nif fees imposed by third parties are disclosed as estimates and those fees change, the consumer is not entitled to a \n\n\n\nrefund of fees paid in connection with the application. Creditors must, however, use the best information reasonably \navailable in providing disclosures about such fees.]\n\n4. Timing of refunds and relation to other provisions. The refund of fees must be made as soon as reasonably \npossible after the creditor is notified, after a term has changed, that the consumer is not entering into the plan \n[because of the changed term,] or that the consumer wants a refund of fees. The fact that an application fee may be \nrefunded to some applicants under this provision does not render such fees finance charges under section \n226.4(c)(1) of the regulation.\n\n5b[(h)] (e) Imposition of Nonrefundable Fees\n\n1. Collection of fees after consumer receives disclosures. A fee may be collected after the consumer receives the \ndisclosures required under this section [and brochure] and before the expiration of three business days, although \nthe fee must be refunded if, within three business days of receiving the required information, the consumer decides \nnot to enter into the agreement. In such a case, the consumer must be notified that the fee is refundable for three \nbusiness days. The notice must be clear and conspicuous and in writing, and must [may] be included with the \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b[(d)] (b) [or as an attachment to them]. If disclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b(b) \n[and brochure] are mailed to the consumer, \u00a7 226.5b(e) [footnote 10d] of the regulation provides that a \nnonrefundable fee may not be imposed until six business days after the mailing.\n\n2. Collection of fees before consumer receives disclosures. An application fee may be collected before the \nconsumer receives the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b(b) [and brochure] (for example, when an application \ncontained in a magazine is mailed in with an application fee) provided that [it] the fee remains refundable until three \nbusiness days after the consumer receives the section 226.5b (b) disclosures. No other fees except a refundable \nmembership fee may be collected until after the consumer receives the disclosures required under section 226.5b \n(b).\n\n3. Relation to other provisions. A fee collected before disclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b(b) are provided may \nbecome nonrefundable except that, under section 226.5b[(g)] (d), it must be refunded if a term changes and the \nconsumer elects not to enter into the plan [because of a change in terms]. (Of course, all fees must be refunded if \nthe consumer later rescinds under section 226.15.)\n\n4. Definition of \"Business Day\". For purposes \u00a7 226.5b(e), the more precise definition of business day (meaning all \ncalendar days except Sundays and specified federal holidays) under \u00a7 226.2(a)(6) applies. See comment 2(a)(6)-2.\n\n5b(f) Limitations on home-equity plans.\n\nParagraph 5b(f)(2)(ii).\n\n1. Under this paragraph, a creditor may not terminate and accelerate a home-equity plan, or take the lesser actions \nof permanently suspending advances or reducing the credit limit, imposing a penalty rate of interest, or adding or \nincreasing a fee (as permitted under comment 5b(f)(2)-2, unless the consumer's required minimum payment is not \nreceived by the creditor within 30 days after the due date for that payment. This paragraph does not prohibit a \ncreditor from imposing a late-payment fee disclosed in the agreement, or from temporarily suspending advances or \nreducing the credit limit for a \"default of any material obligation\" (as permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C)), for a \ndelinquency of 30 days or fewer.\n\n2. A creditor may not take any action under this paragraph unless the creditor complies with notice requirements \nunder \u00a7 226.9(j)(3), which requires notice of the action taken and the reasons for the action and, if applicable, notice \nof an increased annual percentage rate (under \u00a7 226.9(i)(1)) or notice of any other change in terms, such as the \naddition or increase of a fee (under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)). This section does not override any state or other law that \nrequires a right to cure notice, or otherwise places a duty on the creditor before it can terminate a plan and \naccelerate the balance.\n\n\n\n[1. Failure to meet repayment terms. A creditor may terminate a plan and accelerate the balance when the \nconsumer fails to meet the repayment terms provided for in the agreement. However, a creditor may terminate and \naccelerate under this provision only if the consumer actually fails to make payments. For example, a creditor may \nnot terminate and accelerate if the consumer, in error, sends a payment to the wrong location, such as a branch \nrather than the main office of the creditor. If a consumer files for or is placed in bankruptcy, the creditor may \nterminate and accelerate under this provision if the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms of the agreement. \nThis section does not override any state or other law that requires a right to cure notice, or otherwise places a duty \non the creditor before it can terminate a plan and accelerate the balance.]\n\n* * * *\n\nParagraph 5b(f)(2)(iv)\n\n1. \"Federal law\" under this provision is limited to any federal statute, its implementing regulation, and official \ninterpretations issued by the regulatory agency with authority to implement the statute or regulation.\n\n* * * *\n\nParagraph 5b(f)(3).\n\n1. Scope of provision. In general, a creditor may not change the terms of a plan after it is opened. For example, a \ncreditor may not increase any fee or impose a new fee once the plan has been opened, even if the fee is charged \nby a third party, such as a credit reporting agency, for a service. The change-of-terms prohibition applies to all \nfeatures of a plan, not only those required to be disclosed under this section. [For example, this provision applies to \ncharges imposed for late payment, although this fee is not required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(7).]\n\n2. [Charges not covered] Certain tax and insurance charges. [There are three charges not covered by this \nprovision.] A creditor may pass on increases in taxes since such charges are imposed by a governmental body and \nare beyond the control of the creditor. In addition, a creditor may pass on increases in premiums for property \ninsurance that are excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(d)(2), since such insurance provides a benefit to \nthe consumer independent of the use of the line and is often maintained notwithstanding the line. A creditor also \nmay pass on increases in premiums for credit insurance that are excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(1), since the insurance is voluntary and provides a benefit to the consumer.\n\n3. Certain default-related charges. This provision does not prohibit a creditor from passing on to the consumer bona \nfide and reasonable costs incurred by the creditor for collection activity after default, to protect the creditor's interest \nin the property securing the plan, or to foreclose on the securing property. These costs might include, among \nothers, attorneys' fees, court costs, property repairs, payment of overdue taxes, or paying sums secured by a lien \nwith priority over the lien securing the home-equity plan. The requirement that these costs be \"bona fide and \nreasonable\" means that the creditor must actually incur the costs and that the amount of the costs must be \nreasonably related to the services related to debt collection, collateral protection or foreclosure. A creditor may pass \nthese costs on to the consumer only if the creditor incurs these costs due to the consumer's default on an obligation \nunder the agreement for the plan.\n\nParagraph 5b(f)(3)(i).\n\n1. Changes provided for in agreement. A creditor may provide in the initial agreement that further advances may be \nprohibited or the credit line reduced during any period in which the maximum annual percentage rate is reached. A \ncreditor may provide for other specific changes to take place upon the occurrence of specific events. Both the \ntriggering event and the resulting modification must be stated with specificity. For example, in home-equity plans for \nemployees, the agreement could provide that a specified higher rate or margin will apply if the borrower's \nemployment with the creditor ends, or upon the occurrence of some other triggering event. However, the agreement \nwould not be permitted to provide for a rate or margin higher than the one that would have been available to the \nconsumer in the absence of special circumstances such as employment with the creditor (unless the triggering \nevent is a circumstance that would permit the rate to be increased as a penalty under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) and comment \n\n\n\n5b(f)(2)-2)). A contract could contain a stepped-rate or stepped-fee schedule providing for specified changes in the \nrate or the fees on certain dates or after a specified period of time. A creditor also may provide in the initial \nagreement that it will be entitled to a share of the appreciation in the value of the property as long as the specific \nappreciation share and the specific circumstances which require the payment of it are set forth. A contract may \npermit a consumer to switch among minimum-payment options during the plan.\n\n* * * *\n\nParagraph 5b(f)(3)(iv).\n\n1. Beneficial changes. After a plan is opened, a creditor may make changes that unequivocally benefit the \nconsumer. Under this provision, a creditor may offer more options to consumers, as long as existing options remain. \nFor example, a creditor may offer the consumer the option of making lower monthly payments or could increase the \ncredit limit. Similarly, a creditor wishing to extend the length of the plan on the same terms may do so. Creditors are \npermitted to temporarily reduce the rate or fees charged during the plan (though change-in-terms notice would \n[may] be required under \u00a7 226.9(c) (1) when the rate or fees are returned to their original level unless these \nfeatures are explained on the account-opening disclosure statement required under \u00a7 226.6 (including an \nexplanation of the terms upon resumption). Also, as long as the 45-day advance notice timing requirement of \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1) is met, notice of the increase in the rate or fees may be included with a notice to the consumer that the \nrate or fees are being reduced. Creditors also may offer an additional means of access to the line, even if fees are \nassociated with using the device, provided the consumer retains the ability to use prior access devices on the \noriginal terms.\n\nParagraph 5b(f)(3)(v).\n\n1. Insignificant changes. A creditor is permitted to make insignificant changes after a plan is opened. This rule \naccommodates operational and similar problems, such as changing the address of the creditor for purposes of \nsending payments. It does not permit a creditor to change a term such as a fee charged for late payments.\n\n2. Examples of insignificant changes. Creditors may make minor changes to features such as the billing cycle date, \nthe payment due date (as long as the consumer does not have a diminished grace period if one is provided), and \nthe day of the month on which index values are measured to determine changes to the rate for variable-rate plans. \nA creditor also may change its rounding practice in accordance with the tolerance rules set forth in \u00a7 226.14 (for \nexample, stating an exact APR is 14.3333 percent as 14.3 percent, even if it had previously been stated as 14.33 \npercent.) A creditor may change the balance computation method it uses only if the change produces an \ninsignificant difference in the finance charge paid by the consumer. For example, a creditor may switch from using \nthe average-daily-balance method (including new transactions) to the daily balance method (including new \ntransactions). A creditor may also eliminate a means of access to the line, as long as one or more access devices \navailable at account opening remain available to the consumer on the original terms. For example, a creditor could \neliminate the option of accessing a plan via credit card, but only if the creditor originally offered access to the plan \nvia check or a credit card, and the option of accessing the account via check remains, based on the terms in the \ninitial agreement. A creditor may not change the original terms on which an existing access device is available \nunder this provision, although such change may be permitted as a \"beneficial change\" under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iv).\n\nParagraph 5b(f)(3)(vi).\n\n1. Suspension of credit or reduction of credit limit. A creditor may prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce \nthe credit limit in the circumstances specified in this section of the regulation. In addition, as discussed under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(i), a creditor may contractually reserve the right to take such actions when the maximum annual \npercentage rate is reached. A creditor may not take these actions under other circumstances, unless the creditor \nwould be permitted to terminate the line and accelerate the balance as described in section 226.5b(f)(2). The \ncreditor's right to reduce the credit limit does not permit reducing the limit below the amount of the outstanding \nbalance if this would require the consumer to make a higher payment.\n\n\n\n[2. Temporary nature of suspension or reduction. Creditors are permitted to prohibit additional extensions of credit \nor reduce the credit limit only while one of the designated circumstances exists. When the circumstance justifying \nthe creditor's action ceases to exist, credit privileges must be reinstated, assuming that no other circumstance \npermitting such action exists at that time.]\n\n[3. Imposition of fees. If not prohibited by state law, a creditor may collect only bona fide and reasonable appraisal \nand credit-report fees if such fees are actually incurred in investigating whether the condition permitting the freeze \ncontinues to exist. A creditor may not, in any circumstances, charge a fee to reinstate a credit line that has been \nsuspended or reduced once the condition has been determined not to exist.]\n\n[4. Reinstatement of credit privileges. Creditors are responsible for ensuring that credit privileges are restored as \nsoon as reasonably possible after the condition that permitted the creditor's action ceases to exist. One way a \ncreditor can meet this responsibility is to monitor the line on an ongoing basis to determine when the condition \nceases to exist. The creditor must investigate the condition frequently enough to assure itself that the condition \npermitting the freeze continues to exist. The frequency with which the creditor must investigate to determine \nwhether a condition continues to exist depends upon the specific condition permitting the freeze. As an alternative \nto such monitoring, the creditor may shift the duty to the consumer to request reinstatement of credit privileges by \nproviding a notice in accordance with \u00a7 226.9(c)(3). A creditor may require a reinstatement request to be in writing if \nit notifies the consumer of this requirement on the notice provided under \u00a7 226.9(c)(3). Once the consumer requests \nreinstatement, the creditor must promptly investigate to determine whether the condition allowing the freeze \ncontinues to exist. Under this alternative, the creditor has a duty to investigate only upon the consumer's request.]\n\n[5.] 2. Suspension of credit privileges following request by consumer. A creditor may honor a specific request by a \nconsumer to suspend credit privileges or reduce the credit limit. If the consumer later requests that the creditor \nreinstate credit privileges, the creditor must do so provided no other circumstance justifying a suspension or credit \nlimit reduction exists at that time. If a circumstance justifying a suspension or credit limit reduction exists at that time \nand the creditor therefore does not reinstate credit privileges, the creditor must comply with the notice requirements \nof \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) or (j)(3), as applicable. If two or more consumers are obligated under a plan and each has the ability \nto take advances, the agreement may permit any of the consumers to direct the creditor not to make further \nadvances or to reduce the credit limit. A creditor may require that all persons obligated under a plan request \nreinstatement.\n\n[6.] 4. Significant decline defined--safe harbors. What constitutes a significant decline for purposes of \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) will vary according to individual circumstances. At a minimum, this means that compliance with \nthis provision requires the creditor to assess the value of the property based on specific characteristics of the \nproperty. For plans with a combined loan-to-value ratio at origination of 90 percent or higher, a five (5) percent \nreduction in the property value would constitute a significant decline under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A). For plans with a \ncombined loan-to-value ratio at origination of under 90 percent, a decline in value would be significant under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) if the value of the dwelling declines such that the initial difference between the credit limit and the \navailable equity (based on the property's [appraised] value for purposes of the plan) is reduced, by 50 percent. For \nexample, assume that a house with a first mortgage of $ 50,000 is [appraised] valued at origination at $ 100,000 \nand the credit limit is $ 30,000. The difference between the credit limit and the available equity is $ 20,000, half of \nwhich is $ 10,000. The creditor could prohibit further advances or reduce the credit limit if the value of the property \ndeclines from $ 100,000 to $ 90,000. [This provision does not require a creditor to obtain an appraisal before \nsuspending credit privileges, although a significant decline must occur before suspension can occur.]\n\n5. Property valuation tools. Section 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) does not require a creditor to obtain an appraisal before \nsuspending credit privileges or reducing the credit limit, although a significant decline must occur before a creditor \nsuspends advances or reduces the credit limit. If not prohibited by state law, property valuation methods other than \nan appraisal that may be appropriate to use under this provision include, but are not limited to, automated valuation \nmodels, tax assessment valuations, and broker price opinions. Any property valuation method must, however, \nconsider specific characteristics of the property, such as square footage and number of rooms, and not merely \nestimate the value based on property values or re-sale prices generally in a particular geographic area.\n\n\n\n[7.] 6. Material change in financial circumstances. Two conditions must be met for \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) to apply. \nFirst, there must be a \"material change\" in the consumer's financial circumstances[, such as a significant decrease \nin the consumer's income]. Ways in which this first condition may be met include, but are not limited to, \ndemonstration of a significant decrease in the consumer's income, or credit report information showing late \npayments or nonpayments on the part of the consumer, such as delinquencies, defaults, or derogatory collections \nor public records related to the consumer's failure to pay other obligations according to their terms. Second, as a \nresult of this change, the creditor must have a reasonable belief that the consumer will be unable to fulfill the \npayment obligations of the plan. In all cases, the creditor must have a basis to support the creditor's reasonable \nbelief that the consumer will be unable to fulfill the repayment obligations of the plan. A creditor may[, but does not \nhave to,] rely on, for example, the consumer's failure to pay other debts, such as significant delinquencies, defaults, \nor derogatory collections or public records [specific evidence (such as the failure to pay other debts)] in concluding \nthat the second part of the test has been met. However, late payments of 30 days or fewer, by themselves, would \nnot be sufficient to satisfy the second part of the test. The payment failures that may serve as evidence under either \nprong of the two-part test must have occurred within a reasonable time from the date of the creditor's review of the \nconsumer's credit performance. In all cases, a payment failure will be deemed to have occurred within a reasonable \ntime from the date of the creditor's review if it occurred within six months of the creditor's suspending advances or \nreducing the credit limit, and the consumer has not brought the account or other obligation current as of the time of \nthe review. A creditor may prohibit further advances or reduce the credit limit under this section if a consumer files \nfor or is placed in bankruptcy.\n\n[8.] 7. Default of a material obligation. Creditors must [may] specify events that would qualify as a default of a \nmaterial obligation under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C). For example, a creditor may provide that default of a material \nobligation will exist if the consumer moves out of the dwelling or permits an intervening lien to be filed that would \ntake priority over future advances made by the creditor.\n\n[9.] 8. Government limits on the annual percentage rate. Under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D), a creditor may prohibit further \nadvances or reduce the credit limit if, for example, a state usury law is enacted which prohibits a creditor from \nimposing the agreed-upon annual percentage rate.\n\n9. Suspensions and credit limit reductions required by federal law. \"Federal law\" under this provision is limited to \nany federal statute, its implementing regulation, and official interpretations issued by the regulatory agency with \nauthority to implement the statute or regulation. A creditor may prohibit either a single advance or multiple \nadvances, depending on what the applicable federal law requires.\n\n5b(g) Reinstatement of Credit Privileges.\n\n1. Temporary nature of suspension or reduction. Creditors are permitted to prohibit additional extensions of credit or \nreduce the credit limit under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi) only while one of the designated circumstances exists. \nWhen the circumstance justifying the creditor's action ceases to exist, the creditor must reinstate the consumer's \ncredit privileges, assuming that no other circumstance permitting the creditor's action exists at that time.\n\n2. Imposition of fees to reinstate a credit line. A creditor may not, in any circumstances, charge a fee to reinstate a \ncredit line that has been suspended or reduced under paragraphs 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi) once [the] no condition \npermitting the suspension or reduction [has been determined not to] exists.\n\nParagraph 5b(g)(1).\n\n1. Creditor responsibility for restoring credit privileges. Creditors are responsible for ensuring that credit privileges \nare restored as soon as reasonably possible after the condition that permitted the creditor's action ceases to exist \nand no other condition permitting a freeze or credit limit reduction exists at that time. One way in which a creditor \ncan meet this obligation is to monitor the line on an ongoing basis to determine when the condition permitting the \nfreeze or credit limit reduction ceases to exist. The creditor must investigate the condition frequently enough to \nassure itself that the condition permitting the freeze or credit limit reduction continues to exist. The frequency with \nwhich the creditor must investigate to determine whether a condition continues to exist depends upon the specific \n\n\n\ncondition permitting the freeze. As an alternative to [such] ongoing monitoring, the creditor may shift the duty to the \nconsumer to request reinstatement of credit privileges. [A creditor may require a reinstatement request to be in \nwriting if it notifies the consumer of this requirement on the notice provided under \u00a7 226.9(c)(3). Once the consumer \nrequests reinstatement, the creditor must promptly investigate to determine whether the condition allowing the \nfreeze continues to exist. Under this alternative, the creditor has a duty to investigate only upon the consumer's \nrequest.]\n\nParagraph 5b(g)(2)(i).\n\n1. Disclosure of consumer obligation to request reinstatement. The creditor may shift the duty to the consumer to \nrequest reinstatement if, pursuant to \u00a7 226.9(j)(1), the creditor discloses that the consumer must request \nreinstatement.\n\nParagraph 5b(g)(2)(ii).\n\n1. Creditor responsibility to investigate reinstatement requests. Once the consumer requests reinstatement, the \ncreditor must promptly investigate to determine whether the condition allowing the [freeze continues to] suspension \nor credit limit reduction exists. The investigation should verify that the information on which the creditor relied to \ntake action in fact pertained to the specific property securing the affected plan (as with a property valuation) or to \nthe specific consumer (as with a credit report). To investigate whether a significant decline in property value exists \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A), the creditor should reassess the value of the property securing the line based on an \nupdated property valuation meeting the standards in comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-5. To investigate whether a material \nchange in the consumer's financial circumstances exists under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B), the creditor should obtain and \nevaluate information sufficient to assess whether the original finding on which action was based was accurate or, if \naccurate, remains current.\n\nParagraph 5b(g)(3).\n\n1. Duty to provide documentation of property value. The creditor has a duty to provide to the consumer, upon \nrequest, a copy of documentation supporting the property value on which the creditor relied to suspend advances or \nreduce the credit limit due to a significant decline in the value of the property securing the line under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(vi)(A), or to continue suspension or reduction of an account due to a significant decline in the property \nvalue under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(vi)(A).\n\n2. Appropriate documentation of property value. Appropriate documentation supporting the property value on which \nthe action was based under this paragraph would include, as applicable, a copy of the appraisal report or a copy of \nany written evidence of an automated valuation model, tax assessment value, broker price opinion, or other \nvaluation method used that clearly and conspicuously shows the property value specific to the subject property and \nfactors considered to obtain the value.\n\n* * * *\n\n[5b(g)] 5b[(d)]\n\n* * * *\n\n[5b(h)] 5b[(e)]\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.6--Account-opening Disclosures.\n\n6(a) Rules affecting home-equity plans.\n\n1. Fixed-rate and -term payment plans during draw period. Under some home-equity plans, a creditor will permit the \nconsumer to repay all or part of the balance during the draw period at a fixed rate (rather than a variable rate) and \nover a specified time period. To illustrate, a variable-rate plan may permit a consumer to elect during a ten-year \n\n\n\ndraw period to repay all or a portion of the balance over a three-year period at a fixed rate. A creditor generally may \nnot disclose the terms applicable to this feature in the account-opening table required under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), except \nas required under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xix). A creditor must, however, disclose fixed-rate and -term payment features in \nthe account-opening table if they are the only payment plans offered during the draw period of the plan. (See \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2).) Even though a creditor generally may not disclose the terms of fixed-rate and -term payment plans in \nthe account-opening table, the creditor must disclose information about these payment plans as required by \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5). For example, a creditor must disclose fee and rate information related to these \nfeatures under \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) and (a)(4), and information about payment and other terms related to these features \nunder \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(v).\n\n2. Disclosures for the repayment period. The creditor must provide the disclosures under \u00a7 226.6 for both the draw \nand repayment phases when giving the disclosures under \u00a7 226.6. To the extent required disclosures are the same \nfor the draw and repayment phases, the creditor need not repeat such information, as long as it is clear that the \ninformation applies to both phases.\n\n6(a)(1) Form of disclosures; tabular format.\n\n1. Relation to tabular disclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b(b). The commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(b) and (c) regarding \nformat and content requirements are also applicable to disclosures required by \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), except for the \nfollowing:\n\ni. A creditor may not disclose above the account-opening table a statement that the consumer has applied for a \nhome-equity line of credit.\n\nii. A creditor may not disclose below the account-opening table an identification of any disclosed term that is subject \nto change prior to opening the plan.\n\niii. A creditor may not disclose in the account-opening table a statement about the right to a refund of fees pursuant \nto \u00a7 226.5b(d) and (e).\n\niv. A creditor must disclose the account number as part of the identification information required by \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2)(i)(A).\n\nv. With respect to the statements about the conditions under which the creditor may take certain actions, such as \nterminating the plan, a creditor must indicate in the account-opening table that information about the conditions is \nprovided in the account-opening disclosures or agreement, as applicable.\n\nvi. A creditor must disclose in the account-opening table the payment terms applicable to the plan that will apply to \nthe consumer at account opening (and may not disclose payment terms for two possible payment plans as allowed \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(ii)(B)).\n\nviii. A creditor must disclose in the account-opening table the total of all one-time fees imposed by the creditor and \nthird parties to open the plan, and may not disclose the highest amount of possible fees as allowed under \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(11). In addition, a creditor must disclose in the account-opening table an itemization of all one-time fees \nimposed by the creditor and third parties to open the plan, and may not disclose a range for those fees, as \notherwise allowed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11). A creditor also must include in the account-opening table a cross-\nreference from the disclosure of the total of one-time fees for opening an account, indicating that the itemization of \nthe fees is located elsewhere in the table.\n\nix. A creditor must include in the account-opening table the following fees (that are not required to be disclosed in \nthe table under \u00a7 226.5b(b)): Late-payment fees; over-the-limit fees; transaction charges; returned-payment fees; \nand fees for failure to comply with transaction limitations.\n\n\n\nx. A creditor must include in the account-opening table a statement that other fees are located elsewhere in the \ntable, and a statement that information about other fees is included in the account-opening disclosures or \nagreement, as applicable.\n\nxi. A creditor must include in the account-opening table a statement that information about the fixed-rate and -term \npayment plans is disclosed in the account-opening disclosures or agreement, as applicable.\n\nxii. A creditor must include below the account-opening table an explanation of whether or not a grace period exists \nfor all features on the account.\n\nxiii. A creditor must include below the account-opening table the name of the balance computation method used for \neach feature of the account and state that an explanation of the balance computation method(s) is provided in the \naccount-opening disclosures or agreement, as applicable.\n\nxiv. A creditor must state below the account-opening table that consumers' billing rights are provided in the account-\nopening disclosures or agreement, as applicable.\n\nxv. A creditor may not disclose below the account-opening table a statement that the consumer may be entitled to a \nrefund of all fees paid if the consumer decides not to open the plan; and a cross reference to the \"Fees\" section in \nthe table described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.\n\nxvi. A creditor must disclose below the account-opening table a statement that the consumer should confirm that \nthe terms disclosed in the table are the same terms for which the consumer applied.\n\nxvii. The applicable forms providing safe harbors for account-opening tables are under Appendix G-15 to part 226.\n\n2. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to \u00a7 \n226.6(a) disclosures.\n\n3. Terminology. Section 226.6(a)(1)(i) generally requires that the headings, content and format of the tabular \ndisclosures be substantially similar, but need not be identical, to the applicable tables in appendix G-15 to part 226; \nbut see \u00a7 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 226.6(a).\n\n6(a)(2) Required disclosures for account-opening table for home-equity plans.\n\n1. Fixed-rate and -term payment plans. See comment 6(a)-1 for guidance on disclosing information related to fixed-\nrate and -term payment plans.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(2)(vii) Fees imposed by the creditor and third parties to open the plan.\n\n1. Manner of disclosure. A creditor must disclose in the account-opening table the total of all one-time fees imposed \nby the creditor and third parties to open the plan, and may not disclose the highest amount of possible fees as \nallowed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) for the disclosure table required under \u00a7 226.5b(b). In addition, a creditor must \ndisclose in the account-opening table an itemization of all one-time fees imposed by the creditor and third parties to \nopen the plan, and may not disclose a range for those fees, as otherwise allowed under \u00a7 226.5b(c)(11) for the \ndisclosure table required under \u00a7 226.5b(b).\n\nParagraph 6(a)(2)(x) Late-payment fee.\n\n1. Applicability. The disclosure of the fee for a late payment includes only those fees that will be imposed for actual, \nunanticipated late payments. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.4(c)(2) for additional guidance on late-payment fees. \nSee Samples G-15(B), G-15(C) and G-15(D) for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the late-\npayment fee.)\n\nParagraph 6(a)(2)(xi) Over-the-limit fee.\n\n\n\n1. Applicability. The disclosure of fees for exceeding a credit limit does not include fees for other types of default or \nfor services related to exceeding the limit. For example, no disclosure is required of fees for reinstating credit \nprivileges or fees for the dishonor of checks on an account that, if paid, would cause the credit limit to be exceeded. \n(But see \u00a7 226.9(j)(2) for limitations on these fees.) See Samples G-15(B), G-15(C), and G-15(D) for guidance on \nhow to disclose clearly and conspicuously the over-the-limit fee.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(2)(xii) Transaction charges.\n\n1. Charges imposed by person other than creditor. Charges imposed by a third party, such as a seller of goods, \nshall not be disclosed in the table under this section; the third party would be responsible for disclosing the charge \nunder \u00a7 226.9(d)(1).\n\n2. Foreign transaction fees. A transaction charge imposed by the creditor for use of the home-equity plan includes \nany fee imposed by the creditor for transactions in a foreign currency or that take place outside the United States or \nwith a foreign merchant. (See comment 4(a)-4 for guidance on when a foreign transaction fee is considered \ncharged by the creditor.) See Sample G-15(D) for guidance on how to disclose a foreign transaction fee for use of a \ncredit card where the same foreign transaction fee applies for purchases and cash advances in a foreign currency, \nor that take place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(2)(xxi) Grace period.\n\n1. Grace period. Creditors must state any conditions on the applicability of the grace period. A creditor that offers a \ngrace period on all types of transactions for the account and conditions the grace period on the consumer paying \nhis or her outstanding balance in full by the due date each billing cycle, or on the consumer paying the outstanding \nbalance in full by the due date in the previous and/or the current billing cycle(s) will be deemed to meet these \nrequirements by providing the following disclosure, as applicable: \"Your due date is [at least]  days after the close \nof each billing cycle. We will not charge you interest on your account if you pay your entire balance by the due date \neach month.\"\n\n2. No grace period. Creditors may use the following language to describe that no grace period is offered, as \napplicable: \"We will begin charging interest on [applicable transactions] on the date the transaction is posted to \nyour account.\"\n\nParagraph 6(b)(2)(xxii) Balance computation method.\n\n1. Form of disclosure. In cases where the creditor uses a balance computation method that is identified by name in \nthe regulation, the creditor must disclose below the table only the name of the method. In cases where the creditor \nuses a balance computation method that is not identified by name in the regulation, the disclosure below the table \nmust clearly explain the method in as much detail as set forth in the descriptions of balance computation methods in \n\u00a7 226.5a(g). The explanation need not be as detailed as that required for the disclosures under \u00a7 226.6(a)(4)(i)(D). \n(See the commentary to \u00a7 226.5a(g) for guidance on particular methods.)\n\n2. Content. See Samples G-15(B), G-15(C) and G-15(D) for guidance on how to disclose the balance computation \nmethod where the same method is used for all features on the account.\n\n6(a)(3) Disclosure of charges imposed as part of home-equity plans [6(a)(1) Finance charge.]\n\n1. Fixed-rate and -term payment plans. See comment 6(a)-1 for guidance on disclosing information related to fixed-\nrate and -term payment plans.\n\n[Paragraph 6(a)(1)(i).]\n\n2. [1.] When finance charges accrue. Creditors are not required to disclose a specific date when a cost that is a \nfinance charge under \u00a7 226.4 [finance charges] will begin to accrue. [Creditors may provide a general explanation \n\n\n\nsuch as that the consumer has 30 days from the closing date to pay the new balance before finance charges will \naccrue on the account.]\n\n3. [2.] Grace periods. In disclosing in the account agreement or disclosure statement whether or not a grace period \nexists, the creditor need not use [\"free period,\" \"free-ride period,\" \"grace period\" or] any [other] particular descriptive \nphrase or term. However, the descriptive phrase or term must be sufficiently similar to the disclosures provided \npursuant to \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(xxi) to satisfy a creditor's duty to provide consistent terminology under \u00a7 226.5(a)(2). [For \nexample, a statement that \"the finance charge begins on the date the transaction is posted to your account\" \nadequately discloses that no grace period exists. In the same fashion, a statement that \"finance charges will be \nimposed on any new purchases only if they are not paid in full within 25 days after the close of the billing cycle\" \nindicates that a grace period exists in the interim.]\n\n4. No finance charge imposed below certain balance. Creditors are not required to disclose under \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) the \nfact that no finance charge is imposed when the outstanding balance is less than a certain amount or the balance \nbelow which no finance charge will be imposed.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(3)(ii).\n\n1. Failure to use the plan as agreed. Late-payment fees, over-the-limit fees, and fees for payments returned unpaid \nare examples of charges resulting from consumers' failure to use the plan as agreed.\n\n2. Examples of fees that affect the plan. Examples of charges the payment, or nonpayment, of which affects the \nconsumer's account are:\n\ni. Access to the plan. Fees for using a credit card at the creditor's ATM to obtain a cash advance, fees to obtain \nadditional checks or credit cards including replacements for lost or stolen cards, fees to expedite delivery of checks \nor credit cards or other credit devices, application and membership fees, and annual or other participation fees \nidentified in \u00a7 226.4(c)(4).\n\nii. Amount of credit extended. Fees for increasing the credit limit on the account, whether at the consumer's request \nor unilaterally by the creditor.\n\niii. Timing or method of billing or payment. Fees to pay by telephone or via the Internet.\n\n3. Threshold test. If the creditor is unsure whether a particular charge is a cost imposed as part of the plan, the \ncreditor may at its option consider such charges as a cost imposed as part of the plan for purposes of the Truth in \nLending Act.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(3)(iii)(B).\n\n1. Fees for package of services. A fee to join a credit union is an example of a fee for a package of services that is \nnot imposed as part of the plan, even if the consumer must join the credit union to apply for credit. In contrast, a \nmembership fee is an example of a fee for a package of services that is considered to be imposed as part of a plan \nwhere the primary benefit of membership in the organization is the opportunity to apply for credit, and the other \nbenefits offered (such as a newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely incidental to the credit feature.\n\n6(a)(4) Disclosure of rates for home-equity plans.\n\n1. Fixed-rate and -term payment plans. See comment 6(a)-1 for guidance on disclosing information related to fixed-\nrate and -term payment plans.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(4)(1)(B). [Paragraph 6(a)(1)(ii)]\n\n1. Range of balances. Creditors are not required to disclose the range of balances [The range of balances \ndisclosure is inapplicable]:\n\n\n\ni. If only one periodic interest rate may be applied to the entire account balance.\n\nii. If only one periodic interest rate may be applied to the entire balance for a feature (for example, cash advances), \neven though the balance for another feature (purchases) may be subject to two rates (a 1.5% monthly periodic \ninterest rate on purchase balances of $ 0-$ 500, and a 1% periodic interest rate for balances above $ 500). In this \nexample, the creditor must give a range of balances disclosure for the purchase feature.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(4)(i)(D).\n\n1. Explanation of balance computation method. Creditors do not provide a sufficient explanation of a balance \ncomputation method by using a shorthand phrase such as \"previous balance method\" or the name of a balance \ncomputation method listed in \u00a7 226.5a(g). (See Model Clauses G-1 in appendix G to part 226. See \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2)(xxii) regarding balance computation descriptions required to be disclosed below the account-opening \ntable required by \u00a7 226.6(a)(1).)\n\n2. Allocation of payments. Creditors may, but need not, explain how payments and other credits are allocated to \noutstanding balances.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(4)(ii) Variable-rate accounts.\n\n1. [2.] Variable-rate disclosures-coverage.\n\ni. Examples. This section covers open-end credit plans under which rate changes are specifically set forth in the \naccount agreement and are tied to an index or formula. A creditor would use variable-rate disclosures for plans \ninvolving rate changes such as the following:\n\nA. Rate changes that are tied to Treasury bill rates [the rate the creditor pays on its six-month certificates of \ndeposit].\n\nB. Rate changes that are tied to the prime rate [Treasury bill rates].\n\nC. Rate changes that are tied to the Federal Reserve discount rate. [changes in the creditor's commercial lending \nrate.]\n\nii. The following is an example of open-end plans that permit the rate to change and are not considered variable \nrate: Rate changes that are triggered by a specific event such as and [An] open-end credit plan in which the \nemployee receives a lower rate contingent upon employment, and the rate increases upon termination of \nemployment. [(that is, with the rate to be increased upon termination of employment) is not a variable-rate plan.]\n\n[3. Variable-rate plan--rate(s) in effect. In disclosing the rate(s) in effect at the time of the account-opening \ndisclosures (as is required by \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii)), the creditor may use an insert showing the current rate; may give \nthe rate as of a specified date and then update the disclosure from time to time, for example, each calendar month; \nor may disclose an estimated rate under \u00a7 226.5(c).\n\n4. Variable-rate plan--additional disclosures required. In addition to disclosing the rates in effect at the time of the \naccount-opening disclosures, the disclosures under \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii) also must be made.\n\n5. Variable-rate plan--index. The index to be used must be clearly identified; the creditor need not give, however, an \nexplanation of how the index is determined or provide instructions for obtaining it.]\n\n2. [6.] Variable-rate plan--circumstances for increase.\n\ni. The following are examples that comply with the requirement to disclose circumstances under which the rate(s) \nmay increase: [Circumstances under which the rate(s) may increase include, for example:]\n\nA. \"The Treasury bill rate increases.\" [An increase in the Treasury bill rate.]\n\n\n\nB. \"The prime rate increases.\" [An increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate.]\n\nii. Disclosing the frequency with which the rate may increase includes disclosing when the increase will take effect; \nfor example: [The creditor must disclose when the increase will take effect; for example:]\n\nA. \"An increase will take effect on the day that the Treasury bill rate increases.\" [or]\n\nB. \"An increase in the prime rate [Federal Reserve discount rate] will take effect on the first day of the creditor's \nbilling cycle.\"\n\n3. [7.] Variable-rate plan--limitations on increase. In disclosing any limitations on rate increases, limitations such as \nthe maximum increase per year or the maximum increase over the duration of the plan must be disclosed. [When \nthere are no limitations, the creditor may, but need not, disclose that fact. (A maximum interest rate must be \nincluded in dwelling-secured open-end credit plans under which the interest rate may be changed. See \u00a7 226.30 \nand the commentary to that section.)] Legal limits such as usury or rate ceilings under State or Federal statutes or \nregulations need not be disclosed. Examples of limitations that must be disclosed include:\n\ni. \"The rate on the plan will not exceed 25% annual percentage rate.\"\n\nii. \"Not more than 1/2% increase in the annual percentage rate per year will occur.\"\n\n4. [8.] Variable-rate plan--effects of increase. Examples of effects of rate increases that must be disclosed include:\n\ni. Any requirement for additional collateral if the annual percentage rate increases beyond a specified rate.\n\nii. Any increase in the scheduled minimum periodic payment amount.\n\n[9. Variable-rate plan--change-in-terms notice not required. No notice of a change in terms is required for a rate \nincrease under a variable-rate plan as defined in comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-2.]\n\n5. [10.] Discounted variable-rate plans. In some variable-rate plans, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is \nnot determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate is \nlower than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula.\n\ni. For example, a creditor may calculate interest rates according to a formula using the six-month Treasury bill rate \nplus a 2 percent margin. If the current Treasury bill rate is 10 percent, the creditor may forgo the 2 percent spread \nand charge only 10 percent for a limited time, instead of setting an initial rate of 12 percent, or the creditor may \ndisregard the index or formula and set the initial rate at 9 percent.\n\nii. When creditors disclose in the account-opening disclosures an [use an] initial rate that is not calculated using the \nindex or formula for later rate adjustments, the [account-opening] disclosure [statement] should reflect:\n\nA. The initial rate (expressed as a periodic rate and a corresponding annual percentage rate), together with a \nstatement of how long the initial rate will remain in effect;\n\nB. The current rate that would have been applied using the index or formula (also expressed as a periodic rate and \na corresponding annual percentage rate); and\n\nC. The other variable-rate information required in \u00a7 226.6(a)(4)(ii). [\u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii).]\n\nParagraph 6(a)(4)(iii) Rate changes not due to index or formula.\n\n1. Events that cause the initial rate to change.\n\ni. Changes based on expiration of time period. If the initial rate will change at the expiration of a time period, \ncreditors must identify the expiration date and the fact that the initial rate will end at that time.\n\n\n\nii. Changes based on specified contract terms. If the account agreement provides that the creditor may change the \ninitial rate upon the occurrence of specified event or events, the creditor must identify the event or events. \nExamples include imposing a penalty rate in lieu of terminating the account, as allowed under comment 5b(f)(2)-2, \nor the termination of an employee preferred rate when the employment relationship is terminated.\n\n2. Rate that will apply after initial rate changes.\n\ni. Increased margins. If the initial rate is based on an index and the rate may increase due to a change in the margin \napplied to the index, the creditor must disclose the increased margin. If more than one margin could apply, the \ncreditor may disclose the highest margin.\n\nii. Risk-based pricing. In some plans, the amount of the rate change depends on how the creditor weighs the \noccurrence of events specified in the account agreement that authorize the creditor to change rates, as well as \nother factors. For example, a creditor may specify that a penalty rate may apply in lieu of termination of the account, \nas allowed under comment 5b(f)(2)-2. In these cases, a creditor must state the increased rate that may apply. At \nthe creditor's option, the creditor may state the possible rates as a range, or state only the highest rate that could be \nassessed. The creditor must disclose the period for which the increased rate will remain in effect, such as \"until you \nmake three timely payments,\" or if there is no limitation, the fact that the increased rate may remain indefinitely.\n\n3. Effect of rate change on balances. Creditors must disclose information to consumers about the balance to which \nthe new rate will apply and the balance to which the current rate at the time of the change will apply.\n\n[iii. In disclosing the current periodic and annual percentage rates that would be applied using the index or formula, \nthe creditor may use any of the disclosure options described in comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-3.\n\n11. Increased penalty rates. If the initial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or more specific events, \nsuch as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the creditor must disclose the initial \nrate and the increased penalty rate that may apply. If the penalty rate is based on an index and an increased \nmargin, the issuer must disclose the index and the margin. The creditor must also disclose the specific event or \nevents that may result in the increased rate, such as \"22% APR, if 60 days late.\" If the penalty rate cannot be \ndetermined at the time disclosures are given, the creditor must provide an explanation of the specific event or \nevents that may result in the increased rate. At the creditor's option, the creditor may disclose the period for which \nthe increased rate will remain in effect, such as \"until you make three timely payments.\" The creditor need not \ndisclose an increased rate that is imposed when credit privileges are permanently terminated.\n\nParagraph 6(a)(1)(iii).\n\n1. Explanation of balance computation method. A shorthand phrase such as \"previous balance method\" does not \nsuffice in explaining the balance computation method. (See Model Clauses G-1 [and G-1(A)] to part 226.)\n\n2. Allocation of payments. Creditors may, but need not, explain how payments and other credits are allocated to \noutstanding balances. For example, the creditor need not disclose that payments are applied to late charges, \noverdue balances, and finance charges before being applied to the principal balance; or in a multifeatured plan, that \npayments are applied first to finance charges, then to purchases, and then to cash advances. (See comment 7-1 for \ndefinition of multifeatured plan.)\n\nParagraph 6(a)(1)(iv).\n\n1. Finance charges. In addition to disclosing the periodic rate(s) under \u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii), creditors must disclose any \nother type of finance charge that may be imposed, such as minimum, fixed, transaction, and activity charges; \nrequired insurance; or appraisal or credit report fees (unless excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(7)). \nCreditors are not required to disclose the fact that no finance charge is imposed when the outstanding balance is \nless than a certain amount or the balance below which no finance charge will be imposed.\n\n6(a)(2) Other charges.\n\n\n\n1. General; examples of other charges. Under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), significant charges related to the plan (that are not \nfinance charges) must also be disclosed. For example:\n\ni. Late-payment and over-the-credit-limit charges.\n\nii. Fees for providing documentary evidence of transactions requested under \u00a7 226.13 (billing error resolution).\n\niii. Charges imposed in connection with residential mortgage transactions or real estate transactions such as title, \nappraisal, and credit-report fees (see \u00a7 226.4(c)(7)).\n\niv. A tax imposed on the credit transaction by a state or other governmental body, such as a documentary stamp tax \non cash advances (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.4(a)).\n\nv. A membership or participation fee for a package of services that includes an open-end credit feature, unless the \nfee is required whether or not the open-end credit feature is included. For example, a membership fee to join a \ncredit union is not an \"other charge,\" even if membership is required to apply for credit. For example, if the primary \nbenefit of membership in an organization is the opportunity to apply for a credit card, and the other benefits offered \n(such as a newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely incidental to the credit feature, the membership \nfee would be disclosed as an \"other charge.\"\n\nvi. Charges imposed for the termination of an open-end credit plan.\n\n2. Exclusions. The following are examples of charges that are not \"other charges\"\n\ni. Fees charged for documentary evidence of transactions for income tax purposes.\n\nii. Amounts payable by a consumer for collection activity after default; attorney's fees, whether or not automatically \nimposed; foreclosure costs; post-judgment interest rates imposed by law; and reinstatement or reissuance fees.\n\niii. Premiums for voluntary credit life or disability insurance, or for property insurance, that are not part of the finance \ncharge.\n\niv. Application fees under \u00a7 226.4(c)(1).\n\nv. A monthly service charge for a checking account with overdraft protection that is applied to all checking accounts, \nwhether or not a credit feature is attached.\n\nvi. Charges for submitting as payment a check that is later returned unpaid (See commentary to \u00a7 226.4(c)(2)).\n\nvii. Charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's \nATM in a shared or interchange system. (See also comment 7(a)(2)-2.)\n\nviii. Taxes and filing or notary fees excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(e).\n\nix. A fee to expedite delivery of a credit card, either at account opening or during the life of the account, provided \ndelivery of the card is also available by standard mail service (or other means at least as fast) without paying a fee \nfor delivery.\n\nx. A fee charged for arranging a single payment on the credit account, upon the consumer's request (regardless of \nhow frequently the consumer requests the service), if the credit plan provides that the consumer may make \npayments on the account by another reasonable means, such as by standard mail service, without paying a fee to \nthe creditor.]\n\n6(a)(5) Additional disclosures for home-equity plans. [6(a)(3) Home-equity plan information.]\n\nParagraph 6(a)(5)(i) Voluntary credit insurance, debt cancellation or debt suspension.\n\n\n\n1. Timing. Under \u00a7 226.4(d), disclosures required to exclude the cost of voluntary credit insurance or debt \ncancellation or debt suspension coverage from the finance charge must be provided before the consumer agrees to \nthe purchase of the insurance or coverage. Creditors comply with \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(i) if they provide those disclosures \nin accordance with \u00a7 226.4(d). For example, if the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.4(d) are provided at application, \ncreditors need not repeat those disclosures at account opening.\n\n[1. Additional disclosures required. For home-equity plans, creditors must provide several of the disclosures set \nforth in \u00a7 226.5b(d) along with the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.6. Creditors also must disclose a list of the \nconditions that permit the creditor to terminate the plan, freeze or reduce the credit limit, and implement specified \nmodifications to the original terms. (See comment 5b(d)(4)(iii)-1.)\n\n2. Form of disclosures. The home-equity disclosures provided under this section must be in a form the consumer \ncan keep, and are governed by \u00a7 226.5(a)(1). The segregation standard set forth in \u00a7 226.5b(a) does not apply to \nhome-equity disclosures provided under \u00a7 226.6.\n\n3. Disclosure of payment and variable-rate examples. i. The payment-example disclosure in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and \nthe variable-rate information in \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi), and (d)(12)(xii) need not be provided with \nthe disclosures under \u00a7 226.6 if the disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(d) were provided in a form the consumer could \nkeep; and the disclosures of the payment example under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), the maximum-payment example under \n\u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(x) and the historical table under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(12)(xi) included a representative payment example for \nthe category of payment options the consumer has chosen.\n\nii. For example, if a creditor offers three payment options (one for each of the categories described in the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)), describes all three options in its early disclosures, and provides all of the \ndisclosures in a retainable form, that creditor need not provide the \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) or (d)(12) disclosures again \nwhen the account is opened. If the creditor showed only one of the three options in the early disclosures (which \nwould be the case with a separate disclosure form rather than a combined form, as discussed under \u00a7 226.5b(a)), \nthe disclosures under \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), (d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi) and (d)(12)(xii) must be given to any \nconsumer who chooses one of the other two options. If the \u00a7 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12) disclosures are provided \nwith the second set of disclosures, they need not be transaction-specific, but may be based on a representative \nexample of the category of payment option chosen.\n\n4. Disclosures for the repayment period. The creditor must provide disclosures about both the draw and repayment \nphases when giving the disclosures under \u00a7 226.6. Specifically, the creditor must make the disclosures in \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3), state the corresponding annual percentage rate, and provide the variable-rate information required in \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(1)(ii) for the repayment phase. To the extent the corresponding annual percentage rate, the information in \n\u00a7 226.6(a)(1)(ii), and any other required disclosures are the same for the draw and repayment phase, the creditor \nneed not repeat such information, as long as it is clear that the information applies to both phases.]\n\nParagraph 6(a)(5)(ii) [6(a)(4)] Security interests.\n\n1. General. Creditors are not required to use specific terms to describe a security interest, or to explain the type of \nsecurity or the creditor's rights with respect to the collateral.\n\n2. Identification of property. Creditors sufficiently identify collateral by type by stating, for example, your home. \n[motor vehicle or household appliances. (Creditors should be aware, however, that the federal credit practices rules, \nas well as some state laws, prohibit certain security interests in household goods.)] The creditor may, at its option, \nprovide a more specific identification (for example, the address of property securing the line of credit. [a model and \nserial number.)]\n\n3. Spreader clause. If collateral for preexisting credit with the creditor will secure the plan being opened, the creditor \nmust disclose that fact. (Such security interests may be known as \"spreader\" or \"dragnet\" clauses, or as \"cross-\ncollateralization\" clauses.) The creditor need not specifically identify the collateral; a reminder such as \"collateral \n\n\n\nsecuring other loans with us may also secure this loan\" is sufficient. At the creditor's option, a more specific \ndescription of the property involved may be given.\n\n[4. Additional collateral. If collateral is required when advances reach a certain amount, the creditor should disclose \nthe information available at the time of the account-opening disclosures. For example, if the creditor knows that a \nsecurity interest will be taken in household goods if the consumer's balance exceeds $ 1,000, the creditor should \ndisclose accordingly. If the creditor knows that security will be required if the consumer's balance exceeds $ 1,000, \nbut the creditor does not know what security will be required, the creditor must disclose on the initial disclosure \nstatement that security will be required if the balance exceeds $ 1,000, and the creditor must provide a change-in-\nterms notice under \u00a7 226.9(c) at the time the security is taken. (See comment 6(a)(4)-2.)\n\n5. Collateral from third party. Security interests taken in connection with the plan must be disclosed, whether the \ncollateral is owned by the consumer or a third party.]\n\nParagraph 6(a)(5) (iii) Statement of billing rights.\n\n1. Model forms. See the commentary to Model Forms G-3 and G-4 [G-3, G-3(A), G-4, and G-4(A)].\n\nParagraph 6(a)(5)(iv) Possible creditor actions.\n\n1. Disclosure. Creditors must disclose under \u00a7 226.6(a)(5)(iv) a list of the conditions that permit the creditor to \nterminate the plan, freeze or reduce the credit limit, and implement specified modifications to the original terms. \n(See comment 5b(c)(7)(i).)\n\nParagraph 6(a)(5)(v) Additional information on fixed-rate and -term payment plans.\n\n1. Fixed-rate and -term payment plans. See comment 6(a)-1 for guidance on disclosing information related to fixed-\nrate and -term payment plans.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.7-Periodic Statement.\n\n7(a) Rules affecting home-equity plans.\n\n7(a)(1) Previous balance.\n\n1. Credit balances. If the previous balance is a credit balance, it must be disclosed in such a way so as to inform the \nconsumer that it is a credit balance, rather than a debit balance.\n\n2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the previous balance may be disclosed either as an aggregate \nbalance for the account or as separate balances for each feature (for example, a previous balance for purchases \nand a previous balance for cash advances). If separate balances are disclosed, a total previous balance is optional.\n\n3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some open-end credit plans provide that the amount of the \nfinance charge that has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, \nrather than being separately added to each statement and reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, \nthe previous balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.\n\n7(a)(2) Identification of transactions.\n\n1. Multifeatured plans. [In identifying transactions under \u00a7 226.7(a)(2) for multifeatured plans, creditors may, for \nexample, choose to arrange transactions by feature (such as disclosing sale transactions separately from cash \nadvance transactions) or in some other clear manner, such as by arranging the transactions in general \nchronological order.] Creditors may, but are not required to, arrange transactions by feature (such as disclosing \npurchase transactions separately from cash advance transactions). Pursuant to \u00a7 226.7(a)(6), however, creditors \n\n\n\nmust group all fees and all interest separately from transactions and may not disclose any fees or interest charges \nwith transactions.\n\n2. Automated teller machine (ATM) charges imposed by other institutions in shared or interchange systems. A \ncharge imposed on the cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's \nATM in a shared or interchange system, and included by the terminal-operating institution in the amount of the \ntransaction, need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.\n\n7(a)(3) Credits.\n\n1. Identification--sufficiency. The creditor need not describe each credit by type (returned merchandise, rebate of \nfinance charge, etc.)--\"credit\" would suffice--except if the creditor is using the periodic statement to satisfy the \nbilling-error correction notice requirement. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.13(e) and (f).) Credits may be \ndistinguished from transactions in any way that is clear and conspicuous, for example, by use of debit and credit \ncolumns or by use of plus signs and/or minus signs.\n\n2. Format. A creditor may list credits relating to credit extensions made to the consumer under the plan (such as \npayments or rebates[, etc.]) together with other types of credits (such as deposits to a checking account), as long as \nthe entries are identified so as to inform the consumer which type of credit each entry represents.\n\n3. Date. If only one date is disclosed (that is, the crediting date as required by the regulation), no further \nidentification of that date is necessary. More than one date may be disclosed for a single entry, as long as it is clear \nwhich date represents the date on which credit was given.\n\n4. Totals. A total of amounts credited during the billing cycle is not required.\n\n7(a)(4) Periodic rates.\n\n1. Disclosure of periodic interest rates--whether or not actually applied. Except as provided in \u00a7 226.7(a)(4)(ii), any \nperiodic interest rate that may be used to compute finance charges [(and its corresponding annual percentage \nrate)], expressed as and labeled \"Annual Percentage Rate,\" must be disclosed whether or not it is applied during \nthe billing cycle. For example:\n\ni. If the consumer's account has both a purchase feature and a cash advance feature, the creditor must disclose the \nannual percentage rate for each, even if the consumer only makes purchases (or cash advances) on the account \nduring the billing cycle.\n\nii. If the annual percentage rate varies (such as when it is tied to a particular index), the creditor must disclose each \nannual percentage rate in effect during the cycle for which the statement was issued.\n\n2. Disclosure of periodic interest rates required only if imposition possible. [With regard to the periodic rate \ndisclosure (and its corresponding annual percentage rate), only rates] With regard to disclosure of periodic rates \n(expressed as annual percentage rates), only annual percentage rates that could have been imposed during the \nbilling cycle reflected on the periodic statement need to be disclosed. For example:\n\ni. If the creditor is changing annual percentage rates effective during the next billing cycle (because of a variable-\nrate plan), the annual percentage rates required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) are only those in effect during \nthe billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement. For example, if the annual percentage [monthly] rate applied \nduring May was [1.5] 8.0%, but the creditor will increase the rate to [1.8%] 11.0% effective June 1, [1.5%] 8.0% \n[(and its corresponding annual percentage rate)] is the only required disclosure under \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) for the periodic \nstatement reflecting the May account activity.\n\nii. If annual percentage rates applicable to a particular type of transaction changed after a certain date and the old \nrate is only being applied to transactions that took place prior to that date, the creditor need not continue to disclose \nthe old rate for those consumers that have no outstanding balances to which that rate could be applied.\n\n\n\n3. Multiple rates--same transaction. If two or more periodic rates are applied to the same balance for the same type \nof transaction (for example, if the [finance] interest charge consists of a monthly periodic interest rate of 1.5% \napplied to the outstanding balance and a required credit life insurance component calculated at 0.1% per month on \nthe same outstanding balance), creditors must disclose the periodic interest rate, expressed as an 18% annual \npercentage rate and the range of balances to which it is applicable. Costs attributable to the credit life insurance \ncomponent must be disclosed as a fee under \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(iii). (See comment 7(a)(6)-2.) [the creditor may do either \nof the following:\n\ni. Disclose each periodic rate, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding annual \npercentage rate for each. (For example, 1.5% monthly, 18% annual percentage rate; 0.1% monthly, 1.2% annual \npercentage rate.)\n\nii. Disclose one composite periodic rate (that is, 1.6% per month) along with the applicable range of balances and \nthe corresponding annual percentage rate.\n\n4. Corresponding annual percentage rate. In disclosing the annual percentage rate that corresponds to each \nperiodic rate, the creditor may use \"corresponding annual percentage rate,\" \"nominal annual percentage rate,\" \n\"corresponding nominal annual percentage rate,\" or similar phrases.\n\n5. Rate same as actual annual percentage rate. When the corresponding rate is the same as the annual percentage \nrate disclosed under \u00a7 226.7(a)(7), the creditor need disclose only one annual percentage rate, but must use the \nphrase \"annual percentage rate.\"]\n\n4. Fees. Creditors that identify fees in accordance with \u00a7 226.7(a)(6)(iii) need not identify the periodic rate at which \na fee would accrue if the fee remains unpaid. For example, assume a fee is imposed for a late payment in the \nprevious cycle and that the fee, unpaid, would be included in the purchases balance and accrue interest at the rate \nfor purchases. The creditor need not separately disclose that the purchase rate applies to the portion of the \npurchases balance attributable to the unpaid fee.\n\n[6] 5. Range of balances. See comment 6(a)(4)(i)(B)-1 [6(a)(1)(ii)-1]. A creditor is not required to adjust the range of \nbalances disclosure to reflect the balance below which only a minimum charge applies.\n\n7(a)(5) Balance on which finance charge computed.\n\n[1. Limitation to periodic rates. Section 226.7(a)(5) only requires disclosure of the balance(s) to which a periodic \nrate was applied and does not apply to balances on which other kinds of finance charges (such as transaction \ncharges) were imposed. For example, if a consumer obtains a $ 1,500 cash advance subject to both a 1% \ntransaction fee and a 1% monthly periodic rate, the creditor need only disclose the balance subject to the monthly \nrate (which might include portions of earlier cash advances not paid off in previous cycles).]\n\n[2] 1. Split rates applied to balance ranges. If split rates were applied to a balance because different portions of the \nbalance fall within two or more balance ranges, the creditor need not separately disclose the portions of the balance \nsubject to such different rates since the range of balances to which the rates apply has been separately disclosed. \nFor example, a creditor could disclose a balance of $ 700 for purchases even though a monthly periodic rate of \n1.5% applied to the first $ 500, and a monthly periodic rate of 1% to the remainder. This option to disclose a \ncombined balance does not apply when the [finance] interest charge is computed by applying the split rates to each \nday's balance (in contrast, for example, to applying the rates to the average daily balance). In that case, the \nbalances must be disclosed using any of the options that are available if two or more daily rates are imposed. (See \ncomment 7(a)(5)-4.)\n\n[3] 2. Monthly rate on average daily balance. Creditors may apply a monthly periodic rate to an average daily \nbalance.\n\n\n\n[4] 3. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the creditor must disclose a separate balance (or balances, as \napplicable) to which a periodic rate was applied for each feature or group of features subject to different periodic \nrates or different balance computation methods. Separate balances are not required, however, merely because a \ngrace period is available for some features but not others. A total balance for the entire plan is optional. This does \nnot affect how many balances the creditor must disclose--or may disclose--within each feature. (See, for example, \ncomments 7(a)(5)-4 and 7(a)(4)-5.)\n\n[5] 4. Daily rate on daily balances. i. If the finance charge is computed on the balance each day by application of \none or more daily periodic interest rates, the balance on which the [finance] interest charge was computed may be \ndisclosed in any of the following ways for each feature:\n\nii. If a single daily periodic interest rate is imposed, the balance to which it is applicable may be stated as:\n\nA. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.\n\nB. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance in the account changes.\n\nC. The sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle.\n\nD. The average daily balance during the billing cycle, in which case the creditor [shall] may, at its option, explain \nthat the average daily balance is or can be multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle and the periodic rate \napplied to the product to determine the amount of [the finance charge] interest.\n\niii. If two or more daily periodic interest rates may be imposed, the balances to which the rates are applicable may \nbe stated as:\n\nA. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.\n\nB. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance in the account changes.\n\nC. Two or more average daily balances, each applicable to the daily periodic interest rates imposed for the time that \nthose rates were in effect. [, as long as the creditor] The creditor may, at its option, explain[s] that [the finance \ncharge] interest is or may be determined by [(1)] multiplying each of the average balances by the number of days in \nthe billing cycle (or if the daily rate varied during the cycle, by multiplying by the number of days the applicable rate \nwas in effect), [(2)] multiplying each of the results by the applicable daily periodic rate, and [(3)] adding these \nproducts together.\n\n[6. Explanation of balance computation method. See the commentary to 6(a)(1)(iii).]\n\n[7] 5. Information to compute balance. In connection with disclosing the [finance] interest charge balance, the \ncreditor need not give the consumer all of the information necessary to compute the balance if that information is \nnot otherwise required to be disclosed. For example, if current purchases are included from the date they are \nposted to the account, the posting date need not be disclosed.\n\n[8] 6. Non-deduction of credits. The creditor need not specifically identify the total dollar amount of credits not \ndeducted in computing the finance charge balance. Disclosure of the amount of credits not, deducted is \naccomplished by, listing the credits (\u00a7 226.7(a)(3)) and indicating which credits will not be deducted in determining \nthe balance (for example, \"credits after the 15th of the month are not deducted in computing the [finance] interest \ncharge.\").\n\n[9] 7. Use of one balance computation method explanation when multiple balances disclosed. Sometimes the \ncreditor will disclose more than one balance to which a periodic rate was applied, even though each balance was \ncomputed using the same balance computation method. For example, if a plan involves purchases and cash \nadvances that are subject to different rates, more than one balance must be disclosed, even though the same \ncomputation method is used for determining the balance for each feature. In these cases, one explanation or a \n\n\n\nsingle identification of the name (as permitted under \u00a7 226.7(a)(5)) of the balance computation method is sufficient. \nSometimes the creditor separately discloses the portions of the balance that are subject to different rates because \ndifferent portions of the balance fall within two or more balance ranges, even when a combined balance disclosure \nwould be permitted under comment 7(a)(5)-2. In these cases, one explanation or a single identification of the name \n(as permitted under \u00a7 226.7(a)(5)) of the balance computation method is also sufficient (assuming, of course, that \nall portions of the balance were computed using the same method).\n\n[7(a)(6) Amount of finance charge and other charges.\n\nParagraph 7(a)(6)(i).\n\n1. Total. A total finance charge amount for the plan is not required.\n\n2. Itemization--types of finance charges. Each type of finance charge (such as periodic rates, transaction charges, \nand minimum charges) imposed during the cycle must be separately itemized; for example, disclosure of only a \ncombined finance charge attributable to both a minimum charge and transaction charges would not be permissible. \nFinance charges of the same type may be disclosed, however, individually or as a total. For example, five \ntransaction charges of $ 1 may be listed separately or as $ 5.]\n\n3. Itemization--different periodic rates. Whether different periodic rates are applicable to different types of \ntransactions or to different balance ranges, the creditor may give the finance charge attributable to each rate or may \ngive a total finance charge amount. For example, if a creditor charges 1.5% per month on the first $ 500 of a \nbalance and 1% per month on amounts over $ 500, the creditor may itemize the two components ($ 7.50 and $ \n1.00) of the $ 8.50 charge, or may disclose $ 8.50.\n\n4. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, in disclosing the amount of the finance charge attributable to the \napplication of periodic rates no total periodic rate disclosure for the entire plan need be given.\n\n5. Finance charges not added to account. A finance charge that is not included in the new balance because it is \npayable to a third party (such as required life insurance) must still be shown on the periodic statement as a finance \ncharge.\n\n6. Finance charges other than periodic rates. See comment 6(a)(1)(iv)-1 for examples.\n\n7. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some plans provide that the amount of the finance charge \nthat has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being \nseparately added to each statement and therefore reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, no \ndisclosure is required of finance charges that have accrued since the last payment.\n\n8. Start-up fees. Points, loan fees, and similar finance charges relating to the opening of the account that are paid \nprior to the issuance of the first periodic statement need not be disclosed on the periodic statement. If, however, \nthese charges are financed as part of the plan, including charges that are paid out of the first advance, the charges \nmust be disclosed as part of the finance charge on the first periodic statement. However, they need not be factored \ninto the annual percentage rate. (See \u00a7 226.14(c)(3).)\n\nParagraph 7(a)(6)(ii).\n\n1. Identification. In identifying any other charges actually imposed during the billing cycle, the type is adequately \ndescribed as late charge or membership fee, for example. Similarly, closing costs or settlement costs, for example, \nmay be used to describe charges imposed in connection with real estate transactions that are excluded from the \nfinance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(7), if the same term (such as closing costs) was used in the initial disclosures and \nif the creditor chose to itemize and individually disclose the costs included in that term. Even though the taxes and \nfiling or notary fees excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(e) are not required to be disclosed as other \ncharges under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), these charges may be included in the amount shown as closing costs or settlement \n\n\n\ncosts on the periodic statement, if the charges were itemized and disclosed as part of the closing costs or \nsettlement costs on the initial disclosure statement. (See comment 6(a)(2)-1 for examples of other charges.)\n\n2. Date. The date of imposing or debiting other charges need not be disclosed.\n\n3. Total. Disclosure of the total amount of other charges is optional.\n\n4. Itemization--types of other charges. Each type of other charge (such as late-payment charges, over-the-credit-\nlimit charges, and membership fees) imposed during the cycle must be separately itemized; for example, disclosure \nof only a total of other charges attributable to both an over-the-credit-limit charge and a late-payment charge would \nnot be permissible. Other charges of the same type may be disclosed, however, individually or as a total. For \nexample, three fees of $ 3 for providing copies related to the resolution of a billing error could be listed separately or \nas $ 9.\n\n7(a)(7) Annual percentage rate.\n\n1. Plans subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b. For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b, \ncreditors are not required to disclose an effective annual percentage rate. Creditors that state an annualized rate in \naddition to the corresponding annual percentage rate required by \u00a7 226.7(a)(4) must calculate that rate in \naccordance with \u00a7 226.14(c).\n\n2. Labels. Creditors that choose to disclose an annual percentage rate calculated under \u00a7 226.14(c) and label the \nfigure as \"annual percentage rate\" must label the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate as the \n\"corresponding APR,\" \"nominal APR,\" or a similar phrase as provided in comment 7(a)(4)-4. Creditors also comply \nwith the label requirement if the rate calculated under \u00a7 226.14(c) is described as the \"effective APR\" or something \nsimilar. For those creditors, the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate could be labeled \"annual percentage \nrate,\" consistent with the requirement under \u00a7 226.7(b)(4). If the two rates represent different values, creditors must \nlabel the rates differently to meet the clear and conspicuous standard under \u00a7 226.5(a)(1).]\n\n7(a)(6) Charges imposed.\n\n1. Examples of charges. See commentary to \u00a7 226.6(a)(3).\n\n2. Fees. Costs attributable to periodic rates other than interest charges shall be disclosed as a fee. For example, if \na consumer obtains credit life insurance that is calculated at 0.1% per month on an outstanding balance and a \nmonthly interest rate of 1.5% applies to the same balance, the creditor must disclose the dollar cost attributable to \ninterest as an \"interest charge\" and the credit insurance cost as a \"fee.\"\n\n3. Total fees for calendar year to date.\n\ni. Monthly statements. Some creditors send monthly statements but the statement periods do not coincide with the \ncalendar month. For creditors sending monthly statements, the following comply with the requirement to provide \ncalendar year-to-date totals.\n\nA. A creditor may disclose a calendar-year-to-date total at the end of the calendar year by aggregating fees for 12 \nmonthly cycles, starting with the period that begins during January and finishing with the period that begins during \nDecember. For example, if statement periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering \nDecember 10, 2011, through January 9, 2012, may disclose the year-to-date total for fees imposed from January \n10, 2011, through January 9, 2012. Alternatively, the creditor could provide a statement for the cycle ending \nJanuary 9, 2012, showing the year-to-date total for fees imposed January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011.\n\nB. A creditor may disclose a calendar-year-to-date total at the end of the calendar year by aggregating fees for 12 \nmonthly cycles, starting with the period that begins during December and finishing with the period that begins during \nNovember. For example, if statement periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering \n\n\n\nNovember 10, 2011, through December 9, 2011, may disclose the year-to-date total for fees imposed from \nDecember 10, 2010, through December 9, 2011.\n\nii. Quarterly statements. Creditors issuing quarterly statements may apply the guidance set forth for monthly \nstatements to comply with the requirement to provide calendar year-to-date totals on quarterly statements.\n\n4. Minimum charge in lieu of interest. A minimum charge imposed if a charge would otherwise have been \ndetermined by applying a periodic rate to a balance except for the fact that such charge is smaller than the \nminimum must be disclosed as a fee. For example, assume a creditor imposes a minimum charge of $ 1.50 in lieu \nof interest if the calculated interest for a billing period is less than that minimum charge. If the interest calculated on \na consumer's account for a particular billing period is 50 cents, the minimum charge of $ 1.50 would apply. In this \ncase, the entire $ 1.50 would be disclosed as a fee; the periodic statement would reflect the $ 1.50 as a fee, and $ 0 \nin interest.\n\n5. Adjustments to year-to-date totals. In some cases, a creditor may provide a statement for the current period \nreflecting that fees or interest charges imposed during a previous period were waived or reversed and credited to \nthe account. Creditors may, but are not required to, reflect the adjustment in the year-to-date totals. If an adjustment \nis made, creditors are not required to provide an explanation about the reason for the adjustment. Such \nadjustments would not affect the total fees or interest charges imposed for the current statement period.\n\n6. Acquired accounts. An institution that acquires an account or plan must include, as applicable, fees and charges \nimposed on the account or plan prior to the acquisition in the aggregate disclosures provided under \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) \nfor the acquired account or plan. Alternatively, the institution may provide separate totals reflecting activity prior and \nsubsequent to the account or plan acquisition. For example, a creditor that acquires an account or plan on August \n12 of a given calendar year may provide one total for the period from January 1 to August 11 and a separate total \nfor the period beginning on August 12.\n\n7. Account replacement. A creditor that replaces a consumer's plan with another home equity line of credit plan with \nthe consumer must include, as applicable, fees and charges imposed for that portion of the calendar year prior to \nthe replacement in the aggregate disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 226.7(a)(6) for the new plan. For example, \nassume a consumer has incurred $ 125 in fees for the calendar year to date for a plan, which is then replaced by a \nhome equity line of credit plan also provided by the creditor. In this case, the creditor must reflect the $ 125 in fees \nincurred prior to the replacement in the calendar year-to-date totals provided for the new home equity line of credit \nplan. Alternatively, the institution may provide two separate totals reflecting activity prior and subsequent to the \nreplacement of the plan.\n\n7(a)(7) Change-in-terms and increased penalty rate summary.\n\n1. Location of summary tables. If a change-in-terms notice required by \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) is provided on or with a \nperiodic statement, a tabular summary of key changes must appear on the front of any page of the statement. \nSimilarly, if a notice of a rate increase due to delinquency or default or as a penalty required by \u00a7 226.9(i) is \nprovided on or with a periodic statement, information required to be provided about the increase, presented in a \ntable, must appear on the front of any page of the statement.\n\n7(a)(8) Grace period.\n\n1. Terminology. [Although the creditor is required to indicate any time period the consumer may have to pay the \nbalance outstanding without incurring additional finance charges, no specific wording is required, so long as the \nlanguage used is consistent with that used on the account-opening disclosure statement. For example, \"To avoid \nadditional finance charges, pay the new balance before \" would suffice.] In describing the grace period, the \nlanguage used must be consistent with that used on the account-opening disclosure statement. (See \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.5(a)(2)(i) and 226.6(a)(2)(xxi))\n\n7(a)(9) Address for notice of billing errors.\n\n\n\n1. Terminology. The periodic statement should indicate the general purpose for the address for billing-error \ninquiries, although a detailed explanation or particular wording is not required.\n\n2. Telephone number. A telephone number, e-mail address, or Web site location may be included, but the mailing \naddress for billing-error inquiries, which is the required disclosure, must be clear and conspicuous. The address is \ndeemed to be clear and conspicuous if a precautionary instruction is included that telephoning or notifying the \ncreditor by e-mail or Web site will not preserve the consumer's billing rights, unless the creditor has agreed to treat \nbilling error notices provided by electronic means as written notices, in which case the precautionary instruction is \nrequired only for telephoning.\n\n7(a)(10) Closing date of billing cycle; new balance.\n\n1. Credit balances. See comment 7(a)(1)-1.\n\n2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the new balance may be disclosed for each feature or for the plan as \na whole. If separate new balances are disclosed, a total new balance is optional.\n\n3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some plans, provide that the amount of the finance charge \nthat has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being \nseparately added to each statement and therefore reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the new \nbalance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.9--Subsequent Disclosure Requirements.\n\n* * * *\n\n9(c) Change in terms.\n\n9(c)(1) Rules affecting home-equity plans.\n\n1. Changes initially disclosed. Except as provided in \u00a7 226.9(i), no [No] notice of a change in terms need be given if \nthe specific change is set forth initially, such as[:] a rate increase[s] under a properly disclosed variable-rate plan[, a \nrate increase that occurs when an employee has been under a preferential rate agreement and terminates \nemployment, or an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain \nbalance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified \nminimum]. The rules in \u00a7 226.5b(f) relating to home-equity plans limit the ability of a creditor to change the terms of \nsuch plans.\n\n2. State law issues. Examples of issues not addressed by \u00a7 226.9(c) because they are controlled by state or other \napplicable law include:\n\ni. The types of changes a creditor may make. (But see \u00a7 226.5b(f).)\n\nii. How changed terms affect existing balances, such as when a periodic rate is changed and the consumer does \nnot pay off the entire existing balance before the new rate takes effect.\n\n3. Change in billing cycle. Whenever the creditor changes the consumer's billing cycle, it must give a change-in-\nterms notice if the change [either] affects any of the terms required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(a) [or increases \nthe minimum payment], unless an exception under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)[(ii)] (iv) applies[; for example, the creditor must \ngive advance notice if the creditor initially disclosed a 25-day grace period on purchases and the consumer will \nhave fewer days during the billing cycle change].\n\n9(c)(1)(i) Written notice required.\n\n\n\n1. Affected consumers. Change-in-terms notices need only go to those consumers who may be affected by the \nchange. [For example, a change in the periodic rate for check overdraft credit need not be disclosed to consumers \nwho do not have that feature on their accounts.] For example, a change in the balance computation method, from \naverage-daily-balance to daily-balance (permissible under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(v) as an \"insignificant change\") need not \nbe disclosed to consumers for whose accounts the balance computation method will not change. If a single credit \naccount involves multiple consumers that may be affected by the change, the creditor should refer to \u00a7 226.5(d) to \ndetermine the number of notices that must be given.\n\n2. Timing--effective date of change. The rule that the notice of the change in terms be provided at least [15] 45 days \nbefore the change takes effect permits mid-cycle changes when there is clearly no retroactive effect, such as [the \nimposition of a transaction fee] increasing the credit limit or extending the length of the plan. Any change in the \nbalance computation method, in contrast, would need to be disclosed at least [15] 45 days prior to the billing cycle \nin which the change is to be implemented.\n\n3. Timing--advance notice not required. Advance notice of [15] 45 days is not necessary--that is, a notice of change \nin terms is required, but it may be mailed or delivered as late as the effective date of the change [--in two \ncircumstances:\n\ni. If there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance charge attributable to the consumer's delinquency or \ndefault.\n\nii. If] if the consumer agrees to the particular change. This provision is intended solely for use in the unusual \ninstance [when a consumer substitutes collateral or when the creditor can advance additional credit only if a change \nrelatively unique to that consumer is made, such as the consumer's providing additional security or] when the \nconsumer and the creditor specifically agree to the change in writing before the effective date of the change, as \npermitted under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), such as on paying an increased minimum payment amount. [Therefore, the \nfollowing are not \"agreements\" between the consumer and the creditor for purposes of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i): The \nconsumer's general acceptance of the creditor's contract reservation of the right to change terms; the consumer's \nuse of the account (which might imply acceptance of its terms under state law); and the consumer's acceptance of \na unilateral term change that is not particular to that consumer, but rather is of general applicability to consumers \nwith that type of account.]\n\n4. Form of change-in-terms notice. Except if the tabular format requirement under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii) applies, a [A] \ncomplete new set of the initial disclosures containing the changed term complies with \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i) if the change \nis highlighted in some way on the disclosure statement, or if the disclosure statement is accompanied by a letter or \nsome other insert that indicates or draws attention to the term change.\n\n[5. Security interest change--form of notice. A copy of the security agreement that describes the collateral securing \nthe consumer's account may be used as the notice, when the term change is the addition of a security interest or \nthe addition or substitution of collateral.]\n\n5 [6]. Changes to home-equity plans[entered into on or after November 7, 1989]. Section 226.9(c)(1) applies when, \nby written agreement under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a home-equity plan [--entered into on \nor after November 7, 1989--] at or before its scheduled expiration, for example, by renewing a plan on terms \ndifferent from those of the original plan. In disclosing the change:\n\ni. If the index is changed, the maximum annual percentage rate is increased (to the limited extent permitted by \u00a7 \n226.30), or a variable-rate feature is added to a fixed-rate plan, the creditor must include the disclosures required by \n\u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) and (c)(10)(i)(A)(6), unless these disclosures are unchanged from those given earlier.\n\nii. If the minimum payment requirement is changed, the creditor must include the disclosures required by \u00a7 \n226.5b(c)(9)(iii) (and, in variable-rate plans, the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.5b(c)(10)(i)(A)(6)). [unless the \ndisclosures given earlier contained representative examples covering the new minimum payment requirement. (See \nthe commentary to \u00a7 226.5b(c)(9)(iii) and (c)(10)(i)(A)(6) for a discussion of representative examples.)]\n\n\n\niii. When the terms are changed pursuant to a written agreement as described in \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), the advance-\nnotice requirement does not apply.\n\n9(c)(1)(ii) Charges not covered by \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2).\n\n1. Applicability. Generally, if a creditor increases any component of a charge, or introduces a new charge (assuming \nin either case that such action is permitted under \u00a7 226.5b(f)), that is imposed as part of the plan under \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(3) but is not required to be disclosed as part of the account-opening summary table under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2), \nthe creditor may either, at its option, provide at least 45 days' written advance notice before the change becomes \neffective to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i), or provide notice orally or in writing, or electronically if \nthe consumer requests the service electronically, of the amount of the charge to an affected consumer before the \nconsumer agrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge, at a time and in a manner that a consumer would be \nlikely to notice the disclosure. (See the commentary under \u00a7 226.5(a)(1)(iii) regarding disclosure of such changes in \nelectronic form.) For example, a fee for expedited delivery of a credit card is a charge imposed as part of the plan \nunder \u00a7 226.6(a)(3) but is not required to be disclosed in the account-opening summary table under \u00a7 226.6(a)(2). If \na creditor adds expedited delivery of a credit card as a new service, the new service and the accompanying fee \nwould be permissible under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iv) as a beneficial change. In these circumstances, the creditor may \nprovide written advance notice of the change to affected consumers at least 45 days before the change becomes \neffective. Alternatively, the creditor may provide oral or written notice, or electronic notice if the consumer requests \nthe service electronically, of the amount of the charge to an affected consumer before the consumer agrees to or \nbecomes obligated to pay the charge, at a time and in a manner that the consumer would be likely to notice the \ndisclosure. (See comment 5(b)(1)(ii)-1 for examples of disclosures given at a time and in a manner that the \nconsumer would be likely to notice them.)\n\n9(c)(1)(iii) Disclosure requirements.\n\n9(c)(1)(iii)(A) Changes to terms described in account-opening table.\n\n1. Changing margin for calculating a variable rate. If a creditor is changing a margin used to calculate a variable \nrate, the creditor must disclose the amount of the new rate (as calculated using the new margin) in the table \ndescribed in \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(B), and include a reminder that the rate is a variable rate. For example, if a creditor is \nchanging the margin for a variable rate that uses the prime rate as an index, the creditor must disclose in the table \nthe new rate (as calculated using the new margin) and indicate that the rate varies with the market based on the \nprime rate. (See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n2. Changing index for calculating a variable rate. If the creditor is changing the index pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(ii), \nthe creditor must disclose the amount of the new rate (as calculated using the new index) and indicate that the rate \nvaries and the how the rate is determined, as explained in \u00a7 226.6(a)(2)(vi)(A). For example, if a creditor is \nchanging from using a prime rate to using the LIBOR in calculating a variable rate, the creditor would disclose in the \ntable the new rate (using the new index) and indicate that the rate varies with the market based on the LIBOR.\n\n3. Changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate. If a creditor is changing from a variable rate to a non-\nvariable rate, the creditor must disclose the amount of the new rate (that is, the non-variable rate) in the table. (See \n\u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n4. Changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate. If a creditor is changing from a non-variable rate to a \nvariable rate, the creditor must disclose the amount of the new rate (the variable rate using the index and margin), \nand indicate that the rate varies with the market based on the index used, such as the prime rate or the LIBOR. \n(See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n5. Changes in the penalty rate, the triggers for the penalty rate, or how long the penalty rate applies. If a creditor is \nchanging the amount of the penalty rate, the creditor must also redisclose the triggers for the penalty rate and the \ninformation about how long the penalty rate applies even if those terms are not changing. Likewise, if a creditor is \nchanging the triggers for the penalty rate, the creditor must redisclose the amount of the penalty rate and \n\n\n\ninformation about how long the penalty rate applies. If a creditor is changing how long the penalty rate applies, the \ncreditor must redisclose the amount of the penalty rate and the triggers for the penalty rate, even if they are not \nchanging. (See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n6. Changes in fees. If a creditor is changing part of how a fee that is disclosed in a tabular format under \u00a7 \n226.6(a)(2) is determined, the creditor must redisclose all relevant information related to that fee regardless of \nwhether this other information is changing. For example, if a creditor currently charges a cash advance fee of \n\"Either $ 5 or 3% of the transaction amount, whichever is greater. (Max: $ 100),\" and the creditor is only changing \nthe minimum dollar amount from $ 5 to $ 10, the issuer must redisclose the other information related to how the fee \nis determined. The creditor in this example would disclose the following: \"Either $ 10 or 3% of the transaction \namount, whichever is greater. (Max: $ 100).\" (See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n7. Combining a notice described in \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii) with a notice described in \u00a7 226.9(i). If a creditor is required to \nprovide a notice described in \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii) and a notice described in \u00a7 226.9(i) to a consumer, the creditor may \ncombine the two notices. This would occur if penalty pricing has been triggered, and other terms are changing on \nthe consumer's account at the same time. (See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n8. Content. Sample G-25 contains an example of how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii) when the \nfollowing terms are being changed: (i) the balance computation method is being changed from average-daily-\nbalance to daily-balance; and (ii) the credit limit is being increased.\n\n9. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A)(1).\n\n10. Terminology. See \u00a7 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to disclosures required under \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A)(1).\n\n11. Opt-out disclosure. If a consumer has a right to opt out of one change (such as an increase in the credit limit), \nbut not another being made at the same time (such as a change in the balance computation method), the notice \nshould indicate that the consumer has \"the right to opt out of some of these changes,\" and refer to additional \ninformation specifying which change the opt-out right applies to.\n\n[9(c)(1)(iii) Notice to restrict credit.\n\n1. Written request for reinstatement. If a creditor requires the request for reinstatement of credit privileges to be in \nwriting, the notice under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii) must state that fact.\n\n2. Notice not required. A creditor need not provide a notice under this paragraph if, pursuant to the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(2), a creditor freezes a line or reduces a credit line rather than terminating a plan and accelerating the \nbalance.]\n\n9(c)(1) (iv) [(ii)] Notice not required.\n\n1. Changes not requiring notice. The following are examples of changes that do not require a change-in-terms \nnotice:\n\n[i. A change in the consumer's credit limit.]\n\ni. [ii.] A change in the name of the home equity credit [credit card or credit card] plan.\n\nii. [iii.] The substitution of one insurer for another.\n\n[iv. A termination or suspension of credit privileges. (But see \u00a7 226.5b(f).)]\n\niii [v.] Changes arising merely by operation of law[; for example, if the creditor's security interest in a consumer's car \nautomatically extends to the proceeds when the consumer sells the car].\n\n\n\niv. Suspension of credit privileges, reduction of a credit limit under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(f)(2), 226.5b(f)(3)(i), or \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi), or termination of an account under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) do not require notice under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of \nthis section, but must be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section.\n\n2. Skip features. If a home-equity plan allows consumers to skip or reduce one or more payments during the year, \nor involves temporary reductions in finance charges (permissible as beneficial changes under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(iv)), no \nnotice of the change in terms is required either prior to the reduction or upon resumption of the higher rates or \npayments if these features are explained on the account-opening opening [initial] disclosure statement (including an \nexplanation of the terms upon resumption). [For example, a merchant may allow consumers to skip the December \npayment to encourage holiday shopping, or a teachers' credit union may not require payments during summer \nvacation.] Otherwise, the creditor must give notice prior to resuming the original schedule or rate, even though no \nnotice is required prior to the reduction. The change-in-terms notice may be combined with the notice offering the \nreduction. For example, the periodic statement reflecting the reduction or skip feature may also be used to notify the \nconsumer of the resumption of the original schedule or rate, either by stating explicitly when the higher payment or \ncharges resume, or by indicating the duration of the skip option. Language such as \"You may skip your October \npayment,\" or \"We will waive your finance charges for January,\" may serve as the change-in-terms notice. However, \na creditor offering a temporary reduction in an interest rate must provide a notice in accordance with the timing \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(i) and the content and format requirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) prior to \nresuming the original rate.\n\n3. Changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate. If a creditor is changing a rate applicable to a consumer's \naccount from a variable rate to a non-variable rate, the creditor must provide a notice as otherwise required under \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1) even if the variable rate at the time of the change is higher than the non-variable rate. (See comment \n9(c)(1)(iii)(A)-3.) (See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n4. Changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate. If a creditor is changing a rate applicable to a consumer's \naccount from a non-variable rate to a variable rate, the creditor must provide a notice as otherwise required under \u00a7 \n226.9(c)(1) even if the non-variable rate is higher than the variable rate at the time of the change. (See comment \n9(c)(1)(iii)(A)-4.) (See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n* * * *\n\n9(g) Increase in rates due to delinquency or default or as a penalty--rules affecting open-end (not home-secured) \nplans.\n* * * *\n\n9(i) Increase in rates due to delinquency or default or as a penalty--rules affecting home-equity plans.\n\n1. Affected consumers. If a single credit account involves multiple consumers that may be affected by the change, \nthe creditor should refer to \u00a7 226.5(d) to determine the number of notices that must be given.\n\n2. Combining a notice described in \u00a7 226.9(i)(1) with a notice described in \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). If a creditor is required to \nprovide notices pursuant to both \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) and (i)(1) to a consumer, the creditor may combine the two notices. \nThis would occur when penalty pricing has been triggered, and other terms are changing on the consumer's \naccount at the same time. (See \u00a7 226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n3. Content. Model Clause G-26 contains an example of how to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 226.9(i)(3)(i) \nwhen the rate on a consumer's account is being increased to a penalty rate as described in \u00a7 226.9(i)(1)(ii). (See \u00a7 \n226.5b(f) for restrictions on a creditor's right to change terms.)\n\n4. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.9(i).\n\n5. Terminology. See \u00a7 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to disclosures required under \u00a7 226.9(i).\n\n* * * *\n\n\n\n9(j) Notices of Action Taken for Home-equity Plans\n\nParagraph 9(j)(1)\n\n1. Statement of action taken. The notice under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) must state the specific action taken, such as whether \nthe creditor suspended advances or reduced the credit limit. If the creditor reduced the credit limit, the notice must \nstate the new credit limit. The statement of action taken under this section must include the date the action taken \nwas effective.\n\n2. Statement of specific reasons for action taken. A creditor must disclose the principal reasons for prohibiting \nadditional extensions of credit or reducing the credit limit for a home-equity plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi). \nIn addition to any information specified in comments 9(j)(1)-3, -4, and -5, as applicable, compliance with this \nprovision requires stating the reason under the regulation permitting the action, such as that the maximum annual \npercentage has been reached, the property securing the plan has declined significantly, or the consumer's financial \ncircumstances have materially changed.\n\n3. Disclosure of specific reasons for action taken based on a significant decline in property value. When a creditor \nprohibits credit extensions or reduces a credit limit because the value of the property securing the plan has \nsignificantly declined under \u00a7 226. 5b(f)(3)(vi)(A), compliance with the requirement to disclose the specific reasons \nfor the action taken is met by disclosing--\n\ni. the value of the property obtained by the creditor;\n\nii. the type of valuation method used to obtain the property value; and\n\niii. a statement that the consumer has a right to a copy of documentation. supporting the property value on which \nthe action was based.\n\n4. Disclosure of specific reasons for action taken based on a material change in the consumer's financial \ncircumstances. When a creditor prohibits credit extensions or reduces a credit limit because the consumer's \nfinancial circumstances have materially changed such that the creditor has a reasonable belief that the consumer \nwill be unable to meet the repayment obligations of the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B), compliance with the \nrequirement to disclose the specific reasons for the action taken is met by disclosing the type of information \nconcerning the consumer's financial circumstances on which the creditor relied, such as information about the \nconsumer's income, credit report information, or some other indicia of the consumer's financial circumstances, as \napplicable.\n\n5. Specific reasons in other cases. When a creditor takes action due to a consumer's default of a material obligation \nunder \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C), compliance with the requirement to disclose the specific reasons for the action taken is \nmet by disclosing the material obligation under the agreement on which the consumer defaulted. When a creditor \ntakes action under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D) through (G), the creditor need disclose only the regulatory reason for the \naction. For example, if action was taken because a federal law required the action (pursuant to proposed \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(G)), the creditor need disclose only that the line action was taken because federal law required the \naction.\n\n6. Method of request for reinstatement. If a creditor requires the consumer to request reinstatement of credit \nprivileges under \u00a7 226.5b(g)(1)(ii), the notice under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) must state the method or methods by which the \nconsumer may request reinstatement. For example, if a creditor requires the request for reinstatement of credit \nprivileges to be in writing, the notice under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) must state that fact. The notice must also state the address \nto which the consumer should send the written request.\n\n7. Timing of notice. The creditor must mail or deliver the notice required under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) within three business \ndays after the action is taken. The general definition of \"business day\" in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the \n\n\n\ncreditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions--is used for \npurposes of \u00a7 226.9(j)(1). See comment 2(a)(6)-1.\n\nParagraph 9(j)(2)\n\n1. Imposition of fees. If a creditor reduces the credit limit under \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(vi), the creditor may not \ncharge the consumer a fee for exceeding the new credit limit until after the consumer has received notice of the \naction taken under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1). Similarly, if a creditor suspends future advances on the account, the creditor may \nnot charge the consumer a fee for any advances that the creditor denies until after the consumer has received \nnotice of the action taken under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1). These limitations apply to fees disclosed in the original agreement for \nthe plan. Imposing denied advance fees or over-the-limit fees not disclosed in the original agreement would be \npermitted only if an exception to the general limitations on changing home-equity plan terms under \u00a7 226.5b(f) \napplies.\n\n2. Receipt of notice. For purposes of when a creditor may impose a fee for a denied advance or exceeding the \ncredit limit after suspending advances on a line or reducing the credit limit, the consumer will be deemed to have \nreceived a notice required under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) mailed by the creditor after midnight on the third business day \nfollowing mailing of the notice. The more precise definition of business day (meaning all calendar days except \nSundays and specified federal holidays) applies. See comment 2(a)(6)-2.\n\nParagraph 9(j)(3)\n\n1. Statement of action taken. The notice under \u00a7 226.9(j)(3) must disclose whether the creditor has terminated the \nplan and is accelerating the balance, and, if so, the date on which payment of the balance is due. If, pursuant to \ncomment 5b(f)(2)-2, the creditor has suspended advances or reduced the credit limit, the notice must state this fact. \nIf the creditor is reducing the credit limit, the notice must disclose the new credit limit. In all cases, the notice must \ninclude the date on which the action taken was effective.\n\n2. Statement of specific reasons for action taken.\n\ni. A creditor must disclose the principal reasons for action taken on a home-equity plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2). In \naddition to any information specified in comments 9(j)(3)-2.ii, as applicable, compliance with the requirement to \ndisclose the specific reasons for the action requires stating the reason under the regulation permitting the action, \nsuch as that the consumer failed to make a required minimum payment within 30 days after the due date for that \npayment (pursuant to \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii)).\n\nii. When a creditor takes action due to fraud or material misrepresentation by the consumer under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(i), \nthe creditor need only disclose that the action was taken due to either, as applicable, fraud or misrepresentation by \nthe consumer; the creditor is not required to specify in the notice the nature of the fraud or misrepresentation. When \na creditor takes action due to the consumer's action or inaction that adversely affects the creditor's interest in the \nproperty securing the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iii), the creditor should include in the notice the consumer's action or \ninaction that jeopardizes the creditor's interest in the property securing the account, such as failing to pay property \ntaxes or allowing a new superior lien on the property.\n\n3. Timing of notice. The creditor must mail or deliver the notice required under \u00a7 226.9(j)(3) within three business \ndays after the action is taken. The general definition of \"business day\" in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the \ncreditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions--is used for \npurposes of \u00a7 226.9(j)(3). See comment 2(a)(6)-1.\n\nParagraph 9(j)(4)\n\n1. Notice of action taken under 226.5b(f)(2) other than termination and acceleration, suspension, and reduction. If, \npursuant to comment 5b(f)(2)-2, a creditor takes action under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) other than termination and \n\n\n\nacceleration, suspension of advances, or reduction of the credit limit, such as imposing fees or raising the interest \nrate applicable to the account, the creditor must comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) (for fee \nchanges) or (i) (for rate changes), as applicable.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.14 Determination of Annual Percentage Rate.\n\n14(a) General rule.\n\n1. Tolerance. The tolerance of 1/8th of 1 percentage point above or below the annual percentage rate applies to \nany required disclosure of the annual percentage rate. The disclosure of the annual percentage rate is required in \n\u00a7\u00a7 226.5a, 226.5b, 226.6, 226.7, 226.9, 226.15, 226.16, and 226.26.\n\n2. Rounding. The regulation does not require that the annual percentage rate be calculated to any particular \nnumber of decimal places; rounding is permissible within the 1/8th of 1 percent tolerance. For example, an exact \nannual percentage rate of 14.33333% may be stated as 14.33% or as 14.3%, or even as 14 1/4%; but it could not \nbe stated as 14.2% or 14%, since each varies by more than the permitted tolerance.\n\n3. Periodic rates. No explicit tolerance exists for any periodic rate as such; a disclosed periodic rate may vary from \nprecise accuracy (for example, due to rounding) only to the extent that its annualized equivalent is within the \ntolerance permitted by \u00a7 226.14(a). Further, a periodic rate need not be calculated to any particular number of \ndecimal places.\n\n4. Finance charges. The regulation does not prohibit creditors from assessing finance charges on balances that \ninclude prior, unpaid finance charges; state or other applicable law may do so, however.\n\n5. Good faith reliance on faulty calculation tools. The regulation relieves a creditor of liability for an error in the \nannual percentage rate or finance charge that resulted from a corresponding error in a calculation tool used in good \nfaith by the creditor. Whether or not the creditor's use of the tool was in good faith must be determined on a case-\nby-case basis, but the creditor must in any case have taken reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the tool, \nincluding any instructions, before using it. Generally, the safe harbor from liability is available only for errors directly \nattributable to the calculation tool itself, including software programs; it is not intended to absolve a creditor of \nliability for its own errors, or for errors arising from improper use of the tool, from incorrect data entry, or from \nmisapplication of the law.\n\n14(b) Annual percentage rate--in general.\n\n1. Corresponding annual percentage rate computation. For [purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 226.5a, 226.5b, 226.6, 226.7(a)(4) or \n(b)(4), 226.9, 226.15, 226.16, and 226.26,] open-end credit under Subpart B of Regulation Z, the annual \npercentage rate is determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of periods in the year. [This \ncomputation reflects the fact that, in such disclosures, the rate (known as the corresponding annual percentage \nrate) is prospective and does not involve any particular finance charge or periodic balance.]\n\n[14(c) Optional effective annual percentage rate for periodic statements for creditors offering open-end plans \nsubject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b.\n\n1. General rule. The periodic statement may reflect (under \u00a7 226.7(a)(7)) the annualized equivalent of the rate \nactually applied during a particular cycle; this rate may differ from the corresponding annual percentage rate \nbecause of the inclusion of, for example, fixed, minimum, or transaction charges. Sections 226.14(c)(1) through \n(c)(4) state the computation rules for the effective rate.\n\n2. Charges related to opening, renewing, or continuing an account. Sections 226.14(c)(2) and (c)(3) exclude from \nthe calculation of the effective annual percentage rate finance charges that are imposed during the billing cycle \nsuch as a loan fee, points, or similar charge that relates to opening, renewing, or continuing an account. The \n\n\n\ncharges involved here do not relate to a specific transaction or to specific activity on the account, but relate solely to \nthe opening, renewing, or continuing of the account. For example, an annual fee to renew an open-end credit \naccount that is a percentage of the credit limit on the account, or that is charged only to consumers that have not \nused their credit card for a certain dollar amount in transactions during the preceding year, would not be included in \nthe calculation of the annual percentage rate, even though the fee may not be excluded from the finance charge \nunder \u00a7 226.4(c)(4). (See comment 4(c)(4)-2.) This rule applies even if the loan fee, points, or similar charges are \nbilled on a subsequent periodic statement or withheld from the proceeds of the first advance on the account.\n\n3. Classification of charges. If the finance charge includes a charge not due to the application of a periodic rate, the \ncreditor must use the annual percentage rate computation method that corresponds to the type of charge imposed. \nIf the charge is tied to a specific transaction (for example, 3 percent of the amount of each transaction), then the \nmethod in \u00a7 226.14(c)(3) must be used. If a fixed or minimum charge is applied, that is, one not tied to any specific \ntransaction, then the formula in \u00a7 226.14(c)(2) is appropriate.\n\n4. Small finance charges. Section 226.14(c)(4) gives the creditor an alternative to \u00a7 226.14(c)(2) and (c)(3) if small \nfinance charges (50 cents or less) are involved; that is, if the finance charge includes minimum or fixed fees not due \nto the application of a periodic rate and the total finance charge for the cycle does not exceed 50 cents. For \nexample, while a monthly activity fee of 50 cents on a balance of $ 20 would produce an annual percentage rate of \n30 percent under the rule in \u00a7 226.14(c)(2), the creditor may disclose an annual percentage rate of 18 percent if the \nperiodic rate generally applicable to all balances is 1 1/2 percent per month.\n\n5. Prior-cycle adjustments. i. The annual percentage rate reflects the finance charges imposed during the billing \ncycle. However, finance charges imposed during the billing cycle may relate to activity in a prior cycle. Examples of \ncircumstances when this may occur are:\n\nA. A cash advance occurs on the last day of a billing cycle on an account that uses the transaction date to figure \nfinance charges, and it is impracticable to post the transaction until the following cycle.\n\nB. An adjustment to the finance charge is made following the resolution of a billing error dispute.\n\nC. A consumer fails to pay the purchase balance under a deferred payment feature by the payment due date, and \nfinance charges are imposed from the date of purchase.\n\nii. Finance charges relating to activity in prior cycles should be reflected on the periodic statement as follows:\n\nA. If a finance charge imposed in the current billing cycle is attributable to periodic rates applicable to prior billing \ncycles (such as when a deferred payment balance was not paid in full by the payment due date and finance \ncharges from the date of purchase are now being debited to the account, or when a cash advance occurs on the \nlast day of a billing cycle on an account that uses the transaction date to figure finance charges and it is \nimpracticable to post the transaction until the following cycle), and the creditor uses the quotient method to calculate \nthe annual percentage rate, the numerator would include the amount of any transaction charges plus any other \nfinance charges posted during the billing cycle. At the creditor's option, balances relating to the finance charge \nadjustment may be included in the denominator if permitted by the legal obligation, if it was impracticable to post the \ntransaction in the previous cycle because of timing, or if the adjustment is covered by comment 14(c)-5.ii.B.\n\nB. If a finance charge that is posted to the account relates to activity for which a finance charge was debited or \ncredited to the account in a previous billing cycle (for example, if the finance charge relates to an adjustment such \nas the resolution of a billing error dispute, or an unintentional posting error, or a payment by check that was later \nreturned unpaid for insufficient funds or other reasons), the creditor shall at its option:\n\n1. Calculate the annual percentage rate in accordance with ii.A. of this paragraph, or\n\n\n\n2. Disclose the finance charge adjustment on the periodic statement and calculate the annual percentage rate for \nthe current billing cycle without including the finance charge adjustment in the numerator and balances associated \nwith the finance charge adjustment in the denominator.\n\n14(c)(1) Solely periodic rates imposed.\n\n1. Periodic rates. Section 226.14(c)(1) applies if the only finance charge imposed is due to the application of a \nperiodic rate to a balance. The creditor may compute the annual percentage rate either:\n\ni. By multiplying each periodic rate by the number of periods in the year; or\n\nii. By the \"quotient\" method. This method refers to a composite annual percentage rate when different periodic rates \napply to different balances. For example, a particular plan may involve a periodic rate of 1 1/2 percent on balances \nup to $ 500, and 1 percent on balances over $ 500. If, in a given cycle, the consumer has a balance of $ 800, the \nfinance charge would consist of $ 7.50 (500 x .015) plus $ 3.00 (300 x .01), for a total finance charge of $ 10.50. \nThe annual percentage rate for this period may be disclosed either as 18% on $ 500 and 12 percent on $ 300, or as \n15.75 percent on a balance of $ 800 (the quotient of $ 10.50 divided by $ 800, multiplied by 12).\n\n14(c)(2) Minimum or fixed charge, but not transaction charge, imposed.\n\n1. Certain charges not based on periodic rates. Section 226.14(c)(2) specifies use of the quotient method to \ndetermine the annual percentage rate if the finance charge imposed includes a certain charge not due to the \napplication of a periodic rate (other than a charge relating to a specific transaction). For example, if the creditor \nimposes a minimum $ 1 finance charge on all balances below $ 50, and the consumer's balance was $ 40 in a \nparticular cycle, the creditor would disclose an annual percentage rate of 30 percent (1/40 x 12).\n\n2. No balance. If there is no balance to which the finance charge is applicable, an annual percentage rate cannot be \ndetermined under \u00a7 226.14(c)(2). This could occur not only when minimum charges are imposed on an account \nwith no balance, but also when a periodic rate is applied to advances from the date of the transaction. For example, \nif on May 19 the consumer pays the new balance in full from a statement dated May 1, and has no further \ntransactions reflected on the June 1 statement, that statement would reflect a finance charge with no account \nbalance.\n\n14(c)(3) Transaction charge imposed.\n\n1. Transaction charges. i. Section 226.14(c)(3) transaction charges include, for example:\n\nA. A loan fee of $ 10 imposed on a particular advance.\n\nB. A charge of 3 percent of the amount of each transaction.\n\nii. The reference to avoiding duplication in the computation requires that the amounts of transactions on which \ntransaction charges were imposed not be included both in the amount of total balances and in the \"other amounts \non which a finance charge was imposed\" figure. In a multifeatured plan, creditors may consider each bona fide \nfeature separately in the calculation of the denominator. A creditor has considerable flexibility in defining features \nfor open-end plans, as long as the creditor has a reasonable basis for the distinctions. For further explanation and \nexamples of how to determine the components of this formula, see Appendix F to part 226.\n\n2. Daily rate with specific transaction charge. Section 226.14(c)(3) sets forth an acceptable method for calculating \nthe annual percentage rate if the finance charge results from a charge relating to a specific transaction and the \napplication of a daily periodic rate. This section includes the requirement that the creditor follow the rules in \nAppendix F to part 226 in calculating the annual percentage rate, especially the provision in the introductory section \nof Appendix F which addresses the daily rate/transaction charge situation by providing that the \"average of daily \nbalances\" shall be used instead of the \"sum of the balances.\"\n\n\n\n14(d) Calculations where daily periodic rate applied.\n\n1. Quotient method. Section 226.14(d) addresses use of a daily periodic rate(s) to determine some or all of the \nfinance charge and use of the quotient method to determine the annual percentage rate. Since the quotient formula \nin \u00a7 226.14(c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) cannot be used when a daily rate is being applied to a series of daily balances, \u00a7 \n226.14(d) provides two alternative ways to calculate the annual percentage rate--either of which satisfies the \nprovisions of \u00a7 226.7(a)(7).\n\n2. Daily rate with specific transaction charge. If the finance charge results from a charge relating to a specific \ntransaction and the application of a daily periodic rate, see comment 14(c)(3)-2 for guidance on an appropriate \ncalculation method.)\n\n* * * *\n\nAppendix F [--Optional Annual Percentage Rate Computations for Creditors Offering Open-End Plans \nSubject to the Requirements of \u00a7 226.5b]\n\n[Reserved]\n\n[1.

Permissible changes. Although use of the model forms and clauses is not required, creditors using them properly \nwill be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to those disclosures. Creditors may make certain \nchanges in the format or content of the forms and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a \ntransaction or a plan without losing the act's protection from liability. [, except] However, formatting changes may \nnot be made to the following model forms, model clauses, and samples in Appendices G and H: G-2[(A)], G-3[(A)], \nG-4[(A)], G-10(A)-(E), G-14(A)-(E), G-15(A)-(D), G-17(A)-(D), G-18(A) (except as permitted pursuant to \u00a7 \n226.7(b)(2)), G-18(B)-(C), G-19, G-20, [and] G-21, G-22(A)-(B), G-23(A)-(B), G-24(A) (except as permitted pursuant \nto \u00a7 226.7(a)(2)), G-25, and G-26; and H-4(B) through H-4(L), H-17(A) through (D), H-19(A)-(I), and H-20 through \nH-22. The rearrangement of the model forms and clauses may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, \nclarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses. Creditors making revisions with that effect will lose their \nprotection from civil liability. Except as otherwise specifically required, acceptable changes include, for example:\n\ni. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in referring to the borrower.\n\nii. Using \"borrower\" and \"creditor\" instead of pronouns.\n\niii. Rearranging the sequences of the disclosures.\n\niv. Not using bold type for headings.\n\nv. Incorporating certain state \"plain English\" requirements.\n\nvi. Deleting inapplicable disclosures by whiting out, blocking out, filling in \"N/A\" (not applicable) or \"0,\" crossing out, \nleaving blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable items. (This should permit use of \nmultipurpose standard forms for transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling.)\n\n[vii. Using a vertical, rather than a horizontal, format for the boxes in the closed-end disclosures.]\n\n* * * *\n\n\n\nAppendix G-Open-End Model Forms and Clauses\n\n1. Model[s] G-1 [and G-1(A)]. The model disclosures in G-1 [and G-1(A)] (different balance computation methods) \nmay be used in both the account-opening disclosures under \u00a7 226.6 and the periodic disclosures under \u00a7 226.7. As \nis clear from the models given, \"shorthand\" descriptions of the balance computation methods are not sufficient, \nexcept where \u00a7 226.7(b)(5) applies. [For creditors using model G-1, the phrase \"a portion of\" the finance charge \nshould be included if the total finance charge includes other amounts, such as transaction charges, that are not due \nto the application of a periodic rate.] If unpaid interest or finance charges are subtracted in calculating the balance, \nthat fact must be stated so that the disclosure of the computation method is accurate. [Only model G-1(b) contains \na final sentence appearing in brackets, which reflects the total dollar amount of payments and credits received \nduring the billing cycle. The other models do not contain this language because they reflect plans in which \npayments and credits received during the billing cycle are subtracted. If this is not the case, however, the language \nrelating to payments and credits should be changed, and the creditor should add either the disclosure of the dollar \namount as in model G-1(b) or an indication of which credits (disclosed elsewhere on the periodic statement) will not \nbe deducted in determining the balance. (Such an indication may also substitute for the bracketed sentence in \nmodel G-1(b).) (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.7(a)(5) and (b)(5).) For open-end plans subject to the requirements of \n\u00a7 226.5b, creditors may, at their option, use the clauses in G-1 or G-1(A).]\n\n2. Model[s] G-2 [and G-2(A)]. This [These] model[s] contains the notice of liability for unauthorized use of a credit \ncard. [For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b, at the creditor's option, a creditor either may \nuse G-2 or G-2(A). For open-end plans not subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b, creditors properly use G-2(A).]\n\n3. Models G-3[, G-3(A),] and G-4 [and G-4(A)].\n\ni. These set out models for the long-form billing-error rights statement (for use with the account-opening disclosures \nand as an annual disclosure or, at the creditor's option, with each periodic statement) and the alternative billing-\nerror rights statement (for use with each periodic statement), respectively. [For home-equity plans subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.5b, at the creditor's option, a creditor either may use G-3 or G-3(A), and for creditors that use \nthe short form, G-4 or G-4(A). For open-end (not home-secured) plans that not subject to the requirements of \u00a7 \n226.5b, creditors properly use G-3(A) and G-4(A).] Creditors must provide the billing-error rights statements in a \nform substantially similar to the models in order to comply with the regulation. The model billing-rights statements \nmay be modified in any of the ways set forth in the first paragraph to the commentary on appendices G and H. The \nmodels may, furthermore, be modified by deleting inapplicable information, such as:\n\nA. The paragraph concerning stopping a debit in relation to a disputed amount, if the creditor does not have the \nability to debit automatically the consumer's savings or checking account for payment.\n\nB. The rights stated in the special rule for credit card purchases and any limitations on those rights.\n\nii. The model billing rights statements also contain optional language that creditors may use. For example, the \ncreditor may:\n\nA. Include a statement to the effect that notice of a billing error must be submitted on something other than the \npayment ticket or other material accompanying the periodic disclosures.\n\nB. Insert its address or refer to the address that appears elsewhere on the bill.\n\nC. Include instructions for consumers, at the consumer's option, to communicate with the creditor electronically or in \nwriting.\n\niii. Additional information may be included on the statements as long as it does not detract from the required \ndisclosures. For instance, information concerning the reporting of errors in connection with a checking account may \n\n\n\nbe included on a combined statement as long as the disclosures required by the regulation remain clear and \nconspicuous.\n\n* * * *\n\n12. Models G-22(A) and G-22(B). These model clauses illustrate the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(v). \nThey inform the consumer that the consumer's reinstatement request has been received and that the creditor has \ninvestigated the request. They contain sample language for explaining the results of a reinstatement investigation in \nwhich the creditor found that a reason for suspension of advances or reduction of the credit limit still exists. Clauses \nin Model G-22(A) illustrate how a notice may explain that the same reason or reasons originally supporting the \nsuspension or reduction still exist. Clauses in Model G-22(B) illustrate how a creditor may explain that a new \nreason or reasons for account suspension or reduction exist. Models G-22(A) and G-22(B) do not contain sample \nclauses for all reasons in which a creditor may temporarily suspend or reduce a home-equity plan. A creditor may \ncomply with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.5b(g)(2)(v) by using language substantially similar to the language \nin the model clauses or by substituting applicable reasons for the action not represented in these model clauses, as \nlong as the information required to be disclosed is clear and conspicuous.\n\n13. Models G-23(A) and G-23(B). These model clauses illustrate the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) and \n(j)(3).\n\ni. Clauses in Model G-23(A) contain information regarding information required by \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) regarding the nature \nof the action taken on the home-equity plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(vi) and the specific reasons for the \naction taken. In particular, they illustrate language for a notice in which the creditor temporarily suspends advances \nor reduces a credit limit due to a significant decline in the value of the property securing the plan under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A); a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances such that the creditor has a \nreasonable belief that the consumer will be unable to meet the repayment terms of the plan under \u00a7 \n226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B)); and the consumer's default of a material obligation under the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C)). \nModel G-23(A) clauses also contain information regarding the consumer's rights when the creditor requires the \nconsumer to request reinstatement under \u00a7 226.5b(g)(1)(ii).\n\nii. Clauses in Model G-23(B) contain information required under \u00a7 226.9(j)(3) regarding the nature of the action \ntaken on the account under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2) and the specific reasons for the action taken. In particular, they illustrate \nlanguage for a notice in which the creditor takes action on an account due to the consumer's failure to meet the \nrepayment terms of the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(ii) and the consumer's action or inaction that adversely affected \nthe creditor's interest in the property securing the plan under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(iii). Model clauses for the notice when a \ncreditor takes action due to a consumer's fraud or material misrepresentation under \u00a7 226.5b(f)(2)(i) are not \nincluded because a creditor need disclose only that the consumer's fraud or misrepresentation is the reason for the \naction; if the creditor does not include this information.\n\niii. A creditor may comply with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.9(j)(1) and (j)(3) by using language substantially \nsimilar to the language in the model clauses or by substituting applicable reasons for the action not represented in \nthese model clauses, as long as the information required to be disclosed is clear and conspicuous.\n\n14. Models G-14(A) and G-14(B), Samples G-14(C), G-14(D), and G-14(E), Model G-15(A), and Samples G-15(B), \nG-15(C), and G-15(D).\n\ni. Models G-14(A) and G-14(B) and Samples G-14(C), G-14(D), and G-14(E) illustrate, in the tabular format, the \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.5b to be provided within three business days after a consumer makes an \napplication for a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Model G-15(A) and Samples G-15(B), G-15(C), and G-15(D) \nillustrate, in the tabular format, the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.6(a)(1) and (a)(2) for HELOC account-opening \ndisclosures.\n\nii. Except as otherwise permitted, disclosures must be substantially similar in sequence and format to Models G-\n14(A), G-14(B), and G-15(A). While proper use of the model forms will be deemed in compliance with the \n\n\n\nregulation, creditors offering HELOCs are permitted to use headings other than those in the forms if they are clear \nand concise and are substantially similar to the headings contained in model forms, except that the terms \n\"Borrowing Period,\" \"Repayment Period,\" \"Balloon Payment,\" and \"Annual Percentage Rate\" (or \"APR\"), must be \nused as applicable. In addition, in relation to required insurance, or debt cancellation or suspension coverage, if \napplicable, the term \"Required\" and the name of the product must be used, and for headings that must be used to \ndescribe the grace period, or lack of grace period, the terms \"Paying Interest\" or \"How to Avoid Paying Interest\" \nmust be used, as applicable.\n\niii. Model G-14(A) and Sample G-14(C) provide guidance for creditors that offer two or more HELOC plans and that, \naccordingly, are required under \u00a7 226.5b to disclose two HELOC plans and, if the creditor offers more than two \nplans, a statement that the consumer should ask for details about other plans that the creditor offers. Sample G-\n14(C) illustrates two plans, one (\"Plan B\") with a balloon payment at the end of the repayment period and the other \n(\"Plan A\") with no balloon payment, and shows the required disclosures about the balloon payment, as well as the \nrequired disclosures stating which plan results in the lesser and which results in the greater amount of interest.\n\niv. Model G-14(B) and Samples G-14(D) and G-14(E) provide guidance for creditors that offer only one HELOC \nplan. Sample G-14(D) illustrates a plan with an interest-only draw period of 10 years, no repayment period (i.e., the \nconsumer is required to pay the outstanding balance in full in a single payment at the end of the draw period), and a \nballoon payment. Sample G-14(E) illustrates a plan in which the length of the repayment period depends upon the \noutstanding balance at the end of the draw period, and in which no balloon payment will occur.\n\nv. Among the account-opening disclosure samples, Sample G-15(B) corresponds to early disclosure Sample G-\n14(C), and illustrates the situation where the consumer has chosen Plan B (the plan with a balloon payment) \nshown in Sample G-14(C). Account-opening disclosure Sample G-15(C) corresponds to early disclosure Sample \nG-14(D), showing the plan with an interest-only draw period, no repayment period, and a balloon payment. \nAccount-opening disclosure Sample G-15(D) corresponds to early disclosure Sample G-14(E), showing the plan in \nwhich the length of the repayment period depends upon the outstanding balance at the end of the draw period, and \nin which no balloon payment will occur.\n\nvi. Samples G-14(C), G-14(E), G-15(B), and G-15(D) illustrate plans with discounted introductory APRs, and show \nthe required use of the term \"introductory\" (\"intro\" is also permissible, but is not shown in the samples) in \nimmediate proximity to the term \"APR.\" Samples G-14(D) and G-15(C) illustrate plans without discounted \nintroductory APRs. All of the samples illustrate plans with variable-rate APRs, and show required use of the term \n\"variable rate\" in underlined text.\n\nvii. The samples do not contain all possible required disclosures. For example, the models show the format for \ndisclosure of limits on number of credit transactions, limits on amount of credit borrowed, minimum APR, payment \nlimitations, and negative amortization, but the samples do not show this information. Also, the account-opening \ndisclosure samples show certain account-opening, penalty, and transaction fees in the table detailing fees, but the \nfees shown in the samples do not constitute an exhaustive list of all the fees in these categories that may have to \nbe disclosed.\n\nviii. Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the \u00a7\u00a7 226.5b or 226.6(a)(1) and \n(2) disclosures, Samples G-14(C), G-14(D), G-14(E), G-15(B), G-15-(C), and G-15(D) are each designed to be \nprinted on two 8 1/2 x 14 inch sheets of paper. A creditor may use a smaller sheet of paper, such as an 8 1/2 x 11 \ninch sheet of paper. A creditor must disclose the table on consecutive pages and may not include any intervening \ninformation between portions of the table. In addition, the following formatting techniques were used in presenting \nthe information in the sample tables to ensure that the information is readable:\n\nA. A readable font style and font size (10-point Arial font style, except for annual percentage rates shown in 16-\npoint type).\n\nB. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text.\n\n\n\nC. Adequate spacing between paragraphs when several pieces of information were included in the same row of the \ntable, as appropriate.\n\nD. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words, the text was not compressed to appear smaller \nthan 10-point type.\n\nE. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each row, by providing sufficient margins above, \nbelow and to the sides of the text.\n\nF. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Generally, black text was used on white paper.\n\nix. While the Board is not requiring creditors to use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the \ntable (except for the 10-point and 16-point font requirement), the Board encourages creditors to consider these \ntechniques when deciding how to disclose information in the table, to ensure that the information is presented in a \nreadable format.\n\nx. Creditors are allowed to use color, shading and similar graphic techniques with respect to the table, so long as \nthe table remains substantially similar to the model and sample forms in Appendix G.\n\n15. Samples G-24(A), G-24(B), G-24(C), G-25, and G-26. Samples G-24(A), G-24(B), and G-24(C) are intended as \na compliance aid to illustrate front sides of a periodic statement, and how periodic statements for HELOC plans \nmight be designed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 226.7. The samples contain information that is not required \nby Regulation Z. The samples also present information in additional formats that are not required by Regulation Z.\n\ni. Creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the \u00a7 226.7 disclosures. However, Samples G-\n24(B) and G-24(C) are designed to be printed on two 8 x 14 inch sheets of paper.\n\nii. The summary of account activity presented on Samples G-24(B) and G-24(C) is not itself a required disclosure, \nalthough the previous balance and the new balance, presented in the summary, must be disclosed in a clear and \nconspicuous manner on periodic statements.\n\niii. Additional information not required by Regulation Z may be presented on the statement. The information need \nnot be located in any particular place or be segregated from disclosures required by Regulation Z. Any additional \ninformation must be presented consistent with the creditor's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and \nconspicuous manner.\n\niv. Samples G-24(B) and G-24(C) demonstrate two examples of ways in which transactions could be presented on \nthe periodic statement. Sample G-24(B) presents transactions grouped by type and Sample G-24(C) presents \ntransactions in a list in chronological order. Neither of these approaches to presenting transactions is required; a \ncreditor may present transactions differently, such as in a list grouped by authorized user or other means.\n\nv. Samples G-24(B) and G-24(C) also illustrate how change-in-terms notices and rate increases notices would be \nrequired to appear, if given on a periodic statement. Sample G-24(B) provides an example of a rate increase notice \non a periodic statement; Sample G-24(C) provides an example of a change-in-terms notice on a periodic statement. \nChange-in-terms notices and rate increase notices may alternatively be given separately from periodic statements, \nprovided the formatting requirements of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) and (I) are followed; Sample G-25 provides an example of a \nchange-in-terms notice, and Sample G-26 provides an example of a rate increase notice.\n\nBy order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 24, 2009.\n\nRobert deV.

Lines of credit can \nhave risky features that could make it difficult for you to repay your balance. As a result, you could lose your home. \nAsk your lender about other loan products, such as a traditional home equity loan. For more information, go to: \nwww.frb.gov.\n\n1 Can my interest rate increase?\n\nLines of credit usually have a variable interest rate, which means that the rate can increase or decrease from time \nto time. A lender may offer you a lower initial interest rate for a short time. However, after this period ends the rate \nwill usually increase.\n\n2 Can my minimum payment increase?\n\nYes, your minimum payment can increase based on several factors, such as when your variable interest rate \nincreases or you borrow more money.\n\n3 When can I borrow money?\n\nYou can borrow money only for a specified time, starting when you open your account. During this time, known as \nthe \"borrowing period,\" you can borrow money and you must make minimum payments. When the borrowing period \nends, you will no longer be able to borrow money from your line of credit.\n\n4 How soon do I have to pay off my balance?\n\nAfter the borrowing period ends, under some plans you may be required to pay off your balance immediately in one \npayment. Under other plans you will have a certain amount of time to pay down your balance. During this time, \nknown as the \"repayment period,\" you will not be able to borrow additional amounts and will have to make larger \nminimum payments than during the borrowing period.\n\n5 Will I owe a balloon payment?\n\nUnder some plans, if you make only the minimum payments you will not pay off your entire balance by the end of \nthe term. At that point, you will have to pay the remaining balance as a single lump-sum, known as a \"balloon \npayment.\" If you cannot get another loan to repay this amount, or pay it off using your savings, you could lose your \nhome.\n\n\n\n6 Do I have to pay any fees?\n\nIn addition to an application fee, you may be required to pay four (4) types of fees for your line of credit: (i) fees to \nopen your account, such as loan origination or property appraisal fees; (ii) fees to maintain your account, such as \nan annual fee; (iii) fees to use your account, such as a cash advance fee; and (iv) penalty fees, such as late \npayment or over-the-credit limit fees.\n\n7 Should I get a home equity loan instead of a line of credit?\n\nWith a home equity loan, you can borrow a fixed amount of money at a fixed interest rate. This means that your \ninterest rate and minimum payment will stay the same over time. Consider a home equity loan if you plan to borrow \na fixed amount of money at one time and want to know the exact amount of your minimum payment. Consider a \nhome equity line of credit if you plan to borrow different amounts of money over time and can afford higher \npayments, even if the interest rate on your line of credit reaches its maximum.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nBACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT\n\nIn 1968, Congress enacted the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to protect consumers by requiring lenders to provide key \npieces of information to consumers at various points in time. Congress assigned the Federal Reserve Board (the \n\"Board\") the responsibility of implementing TILA, and the Board currently does so through Regulation Z.\n\nIn 2004, the Board began the process of reviewing Regulation Z to determine whether revisions were necessary. In \nJanuary 2009, the Board finalized amendments to Regulation Z rules applicable to open-end (not home secured) \ncredit (e.g., general purpose credit cards, merchant-specific credit plans, and overdraft lines of credit). 1 The Board \nis currently in the process of reviewing disclosures under Regulation Z related to home-secured open-end credit--\nnamely, home equity lines of credit, and closed-end mortgage disclosures. This report is related to the Board's \nreview of disclosures for closed-end mortgage loans. One of the goals of this review is to ensure that the amended \nregulations lead to improved disclosures that consumers would most likely pay attention to, understand, and be \nable to use in their decision-making.\n\nThis report addresses to the Board's review of disclosures related to HELOCs. One of the goals of this review is to \nensure that the regulations lead to disclosures that consumers would most likely pay attention to, understand, and \nbe able to use in their decision-making.\n\nUnder Regulation Z, HELOC borrowers must receive the following three types of disclosures, in addition to others:\n\n. Application Disclosure: The regulation currently requires that an application disclosure be provided to potential \nborrowers at the time an application for a HELOC is provided. This disclosure provides details about the lender's \n\n1 As of the writing of this report, the Board is in the process of revising these rules in light of legislation passed by Congress in \nMay 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHELOC plan, including the length of the draw and repayment periods; how the minimum required payment is \ncalculated; payment examples; and what fees are charged by the lender to open, use, or maintain the plan. \nBecause this disclosure is provided before underwriting takes place, this disclosure does not include information \nthat is dependent upon a borrower's creditworthiness, such as the annual percentage rate (\"APR\") that the lender \nwill offer.\n\n. \"What You Need to Know About Home Equity Lines of Credit\" Brochure: This booklet (the \"HELOC \nbrochure\") is produced by the Board and has no transaction-or program-specific information. It provides consumers \nwith general information about HELOCs and how they work, as well as a glossary of relevant terms, and a \ndescription of various features that can apply to HELOCs. The Board currently requires lenders to provide this \nbrochure to consumers at the same time as the application disclosure.\n\n. Account-Opening Disclosure: The regulation currently requires that an account-openingdisclosure be provided \nto potential borrowers before they commit to opening a HELOC. This disclosure includes detailed transaction-\nspecific information, including the APR and fees that will be charged.\n\nIn December 2008, the Board contracted with ICF Macro to assist the Board with its review and revision of these \ndisclosure forms. ICF Macro is a research and evaluation company with expertise in the design and cognitive \ntesting of effectiveconsumer communication materials. ICF Macro worked with the Board on its review of credit card \ndisclosures and is currently contributing to its review of Regulation Z rules for closed-endmortgagedisclosures.\n\nSince December 2008, ICF Macro has conducted five rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews with a total of 50 \nparticipants. For each round, ICF Macro developed a set of model disclosure forms to be tested. Interview \nparticipants were asked to review model forms and provide their reactions, and were then asked a series of \nquestions designed to test their understanding of the content. Data were collected on which elements and features \nof each form were most successful in providing information clearly and effectively. The findings from each round of \ninterviews were incorporated in revisions to the model forms for the following round of testing.\n\nThe findings from the consumertesting informed the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z rules for HELOCs, \nwhich the Board will publish for public comment in July 2009, together with the model forms.\n\nSUMMARY OF METHODOLOGY\n\nFive rounds of testing were conducted, each consisting of 10 interviews of approximately 90 minutes in length. In \neach interview, the participant was shown several mock disclosure documents and asked to review them just as \nthey normally would for their own account. They were asked to \"think aloud\" while doing so--in other words, to \ndescribe what they were thinking as they read, and to indicate if they saw anything that they found interesting, \nsurprising, or confusing. When the participant indicated whether he or she was finished, the interviewer asked a \nseries of follow-up questions to test the participant's understanding of the document.\n\nParticipants in each location were recruited by telephone using a structured screening instrument to ensure the \nselection of a range of participants in terms of gender, age, and ethnicity. Most participants had HELOCs while \nsome considered getting a HELOC but opted instead for a home equity loan. A few participants did not have a \nhome equity loan or HELOC, but had considered a HELOC in the past five years.\n\nSUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS\n\nThe following is a summary of key findings from the cognitive testing and the most significant design decisions that \nwere made based on key findings. Some of the research focused on very specific aspects of the content or format \nof these forms, but this summary focuses primarily on the larger issues diagnosed and addressed during the testing \nprocess.\n\nFindings Related to Application and Account-Opening Disclosures\n\n\n\nTiming of Application Disclosure/Creation of \"Early\" Disclosure\n\n. Several participants in the first two rounds of testing became confused when reviewing the application disclosure \nbecause they could not find their interest rate, and were surprised when told that the rate was not on the form. \nOther participants incorrectly assumed that one of the rates shown in a payment example on the application \ndisclosure was being offered to them, when in fact that rate was used only for illustrative purposes.\n\n. ICF Macro's testing of closed-endmortgagedisclosures 2 conducted during the same time period had shown that \nparticipants strongly disliked a disclosure form that lacked specific terms and features because such general \ninformation was not useful to them. Participants in closed-endtesting were shown an initial adjustable-rate \nmortgage (\"ARM\") program disclosure which, like the HELOC application disclosure, is provided with the application \nand does not provide transaction-specific information. Overwhelmingly, participants indicated that because of its \nlack of specificity, they would not find the initial ARM program disclosure useful and would be unlikely to read it. \nWhile participants in HELOC testing were not as vocal in their dislike of the application disclosure, some of the \nsame sentiment was apparent.. Based on the results from the first two rounds of testing and similar findings from \nthe closed-endtesting, Board staff had concerns about the usefulness of the application disclosure for participants. \nTo address this issue, Board staff decided to test a new type of disclosure: an \"early\" disclosure of transaction-\nspecific information that would be provided not later than three business days after application (similar to an early \nTILA disclosure for closed-end loans). The content of this new HELOC disclosure would be similar to the application \ndisclosure, except that it would include information specific to the consumer based on initial underwriting--most \nnotably, the specific APR and credit limit. Model forms for the early disclosure were tested for the first time in Round \n3 and participants overwhelmingly indicated that they would prefer to receive a transaction-specific disclosure soon \nafter application, even if it meant that they would not receive a disclosure of generic terms before they applied. As a \nresult, the remaining two rounds of testing focused on developing, testing and refining an early transaction-specific \ndisclosure, rather than a generic application disclosure of the type that is currently required.\n\nGeneral Structure of Disclosures\n\n. Participants in the first two rounds of testing were shown an application disclosure based on a sample disclosure \nconforming to the existing application disclosure samples in Regulation Z and currently in use by a financial \ninstitution. This form provided required information in a mostly narrative format. Participants found this form difficult \nto read and understand, and their responses to follow-up questions showed that it was also difficult for them to \nidentify information in the text. When the same information was presented in a tabular format, participants \ncommented that the information was easier to understand and had more success answering comprehension \nquestions. As a result, after Round 2 of testing the decision was made to use a tabular format for all model \ndisclosure forms.\n\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR)\n\n. Most disclosures that were used in early rounds of testing included a statement that the APR on a HELOC does \nnot include costs other than interest, as currently required by Regulation Z. The purpose of this requirement is to \nmake clear to consumers that an APR on a HELOC cannot be directly compared to an APR on a closed-end loan, \nwhich includes most fees. However, many participants misunderstood this sentence; for example, some incorrectly \nthought they would not be charged any fees. Just as important, no participants understood the purpose of this \n\n2 ICF Macro will submit findings related to its design andtesting of closed-end mortgage disclosures to the Board under separate \ncover; this report will be published with the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z in July 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nstatement, or how they could use the information when applying for a home equity product. Different versions of \nthis statement were tested in several rounds to attempt to improve comprehension, but all versions were \nunsuccessful in communicating to consumers the statement's intended purpose. As a result, this statement was \neventually removed from the disclosures.\n\n. Some disclosures that were tested did not describe exactly how the APR for the line of credit would be \ndetermined; for example, one form in Round 4 indicated only that the APR \"would vary monthly with the Prime \nRate.\" However, participants consistently indicated that they preferred to be shown more detailed information about \nhow their APR would be determined over time. Therefore, the final model early disclosure forms include the specific \nmargin added to the index to calculate the APR.\n\nFees\n\n. All of the application and early disclosure forms that participants were shown included a range of the total of one-\ntime fees that the borrower could be charged for opening the account. Some forms also provided a breakdown of \naccount-opening fees into four categories (loan origination, loan discount, underwriting, and appraisal). Participants \nconsistently said that they preferred to have the more detailed breakdown of fees to help them understand what \nthey would be paying. As a result, this level of detail was included in the final model early disclosure form.\n\n. In several rounds of testing, participants were shown versions of a table that itemized account-opening fees, \npenalty fees and transaction fees. Participants were asked which of these fees were most important for them to \nknow as part of the early disclosure. Most participants indicated that it was most important for them to be provided \nan itemization of the fees required to open the account in the early disclosure so that they could better understand \nthe costs of opening the HELOC plan. As a result, the total of the account-opening fees and their itemization (as \ndiscussed above) were included in the final model early disclosure form, but transaction fees and penalty fees were \nnot included. Several participants indicated that they would also want to know if they would be charged any fees if \nthey were to open an account, not make any advances and close it within a year. Since several participants \nindicated that they opened up a HELOC as a \"safety blanket,\" with an intent not to borrow any funds unless there \nwas an emergency or a job loss, Board staff felt that for such consumers it would be important to disclose upfront all \nfees to open, cancel, and maintain an account. As a result, the early disclosure that the Board is proposing also \nshows fees imposed by the creditor for the availability of the plan (e.g., annual fee), fees for early termination of the \nplan by the consumer, and fees for required credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspensioncoverage.\n\n. The final model account-openingdisclosure that the Board is proposing includes all fees shown on the early \ndisclosure, as well as a breakdown of penalty and transaction fees. Participants who were shown this disclosure \nduring testing indicated that they found this list sufficient, and could not identify any additional types of fees that \nthey would want disclosed to them.\n\n. Some of the forms that were tested included a statement that other types of fees not listed on the form may apply; \nother forms did not include this statement. Most participants who saw forms without this reference incorrectly \nassumed that all fees were listed on the account-openingdisclosure and that no other fees would apply. As a result, \nthis statement is included on the final model forms.\n\nDraw and Repayment Periods\n\n. The forms that participants were shown in Round 1 included information about the \"draw\" and \"repayment\" \nperiods associated with the line of credit. Most participants in this round indicated that the term \"draw period\" was \nunclear to them, so in Round 2 two alternate terms were tested: \"borrowing period\" and \"withdrawal period.\" \nParticipants in that round strongly preferred the term \"borrowing period,\" so all subsequent model forms used this \nphrase.\n\n. Forms in Round 2 also referred to the \"payoff period\" as an alternate term for the \"repayment period,\" which had \ncaused some confusion among participants in Round 1. However, ICF Macro and Board staff were concerned that \nthis phrase might imply to consumers that they would be fully paying off their balance over this period, when in fact \n\n\n\na sizable balloon payment could be due at the end of the HELOC term. Since there was no evidence that the \nphrase \"payoff period\" was any more understandable than the original term \"repayment period,\" and some \nconsumers indicated that the term \"payoff\" would imply paying off the balance in full, all subsequent forms referred \nto the \"repayment\" period.\n\n. Participants in early rounds had a great deal of difficulty understanding the timing of the draw (or borrowing) and \nrepayment periods. For example, several incorrectly thought that the two periods ran concurrently, or that the \nrepayment period began as soon as money was borrowed. Revised disclosure forms clarified the relationship \nbetween these two periods by highlighting the distinctions between them and by including information about the \ntiming of the periods (e.g., \"Years 1-10\") in sample payment tables. These revisions were effective; participants in \nlater rounds understood that the two periods would run subsequently and that the repayment period would begin at \nthe end of the borrowing period.\n\nHistorical Example Table\n\n. In Rounds 1 through 3, many participants misunderstood the information provided in the historical payment \nexample table currently required by Regulation Z to be included in the application disclosure. In reviewing versions \nof both application disclosures and early disclosures containing the required historical payment example table, a \nlarge group of participants did not understand that the information in this table was based on the actual historical \nbehavior of interest rates; they instead assumed that the data shown was a hypothetical example, and dismissed it \nas not very useful because it did not apply to their HELOC. Even after the meaning of the table was explained to \nthem, many participants indicated that, because these numbers were based on what had happened to the interest \nrate in the past 15 years, the table did not contain any valuable information that would inform their decision making \nabout the HELOC for which they were applying. More significantly, an even larger group of participants concluded \nthat the rate and payment information shown in the historical example table would apply to their HELOC and \nerroneously indicated that the table showed their exact monthly payments. When the numbers in the table were \nexplained to them, most of these participants concluded that the information presented in the table was not useful \nas it led them to believe that those numbers would apply to their HELOC, when in fact they represented just an \nexample of how rates and payments had fluctuated in the past. A few participants indicated that the table did not \noffer any new information not already described in some form elsewhere in the disclosure, such as the variable rate \nnature of HELOCs. As a result, the historical example table was removed from the disclosures and a statement \nabout the rate and payment fluctuations was instead tested in subsequent rounds, as discussed below.\n\n. When reviewing the historical example table, some participants indicated that they found it helpful to know how \nthe index had behaved in the past, so that they could know how much it had changed over time. Some participants \nfound the range of the index useful in determining the likelihood of the interest rate reaching its maximum. As a \nresult, a statement was added to the model forms under the heading Historical Changes in Interest Rate to indicate \nthe range of the value of the index over a 15-year historical period. The intent of this change was to provide the \nmost important information from the historical example table in a simple and efficient way.\n\nDescription of Payment Plans\n\n. Beginning in Round 3, the early disclosures that were tested included information about two payment plans. Over \nthe following two rounds, multiple formats were tested explaining the distinctions between plans and the relative \nadvantages of each Some described the plans in narrative form, while others used a more structured tabular \nformat. The final model early disclosure uses a bulleted format to provide information on how payments are \ndetermined in both the borrowing and repayment periods under both payment plans, and to allow information about \nthe two plans to be compared easily.\n\n. The final model early disclosure also includes a section labeled \"Plan A vs. Plan B\" that directly compares the two \nplans in terms of their overall cost over time and the amount of a balloon payment, if any, because some \nconsumers were unable to determine from the sample payment table (discussed below) which plan would be less \ncostly over time.\n\n\n\nSample Payments\n\n. One aspect of the forms that varied throughout the testing was the hypothetical balance used to calculate sample \npayments. Current Regulation Z requires that payment examples be based on, a $ 10,000 balance. However, \nBoard staff learned through its outreach efforts and confirmed through consumertesting that it is important for \nconsumers to know what their monthly payments would be under the \"worst case scenario,\" namely if they \nborrowed the maximum amount under the credit line. The model forms tested in early rounds were based on a $ \n10,000 balance and a balance based on the maximum credit limit drawn. Some consumers were able to multiply \nthe payment amounts in the $ 10,000 example to determine what their payments would be if they were to borrow $ \n40,000 or $ 50,000 instead. However, a number of consumers preferred a payment example based on the \nmaximum credit limit, indicating that they would like to know what would be the highest payment they would have to \nmake if they borrowed the entire credit limit.\n\n. Recognizing that consumers often borrow an initial amount when they first open their HELOC and make additional \ndraws during the borrowing period, another hypothetical example was introduced in Round 5 based on the \nassumption that $ 10,000 was borrowed on the first day of the borrowing period and an additional $ 10,000 \nborrowed on the last day of the borrowing period. However, this confused participants, who indicated that they \nwould prefer a simpler hypothetical scenario. Some participants thought that they would be required to take an \nadditional $ 10,000 before the borrowing period expired based on this payment example. Several participants were \nconcerned that the payment table was telling them how much they would have to borrow during the borrowing \nperiod, and were unsure whether they could borrow more or less over time As a result, the decision was made to \nshow monthly payments based on either a $ 10,000 balance or the entire credit limit drawn. Due to concerns that \npayments based on a $ 10,000 balance might make the sample payments unrealistically low for most consumers, \nespecially if required minimum payments included only interest; as well as outreach and consumertesting indicating \na preference for payment examples based on the full credit line; the final model forms use a hypothetical balance \nequal to the full credit limit.\n\n. Because minimum required payments could potentially change over time as the principal is paid down, most of the \nforms in early rounds of testing showed a range of payments. For example, one form in Round 2 indicated that \npayments during the repayment period would be \"$ 200.00 decreasing to $ 34.12,\" while another stated that the \npayment would be \"up to $ 200.00.\" Given the two choices, participants strongly preferred the first phrasing, which \nwas used in several subsequent forms, but almost all participants were confused with the range of payments and \nespecially why payments would decrease over time. As a result, prior to Round 4, Board staff became concerned \nthat providing the range of payments could result in \"information overload\" for consumers, especially because a \nnumber of participants spent a considerable time analyzing the range of payments at the expense of not focusing \non other pertinent information on the form. Subsequently, all forms used in Rounds 4 and 5--and the final model \nforms to be released with the Board's July 2009 proposal--listed only the first payment in each period rather than \nthe entire range. Based upon the assumptions used in calculating the payment examples, the first payment in each \nperiod would be the highest payment of each period.\n\n. The final model forms show payment examples for two different interest rates--the current rate and the maximum \nrate under the plan. Forms used in Round 2 listed payments for four different rates, rather than two. However, the \ndecision was made that the marginal benefit of showing two additional rates was small, compared to the risk of \noverwhelming consumers with too many dollar figures.\n\nInformation about Risks\n\n. The final model forms include a section labeled \"Risks,\" which includes information about the security interest, \npossible creditor actions such as account termination or suspension, and tax deductibility of interest, as currently \nrequired by Regulation Z. Grouping this information in a single section and labeling that section \"Risks\" made it \nmore noticeable to participants and easier for them to review the information quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n\n. Some versions of application and early disclosures that were tested displayed the \"Risks\" section at the top of the \nform, and others at the bottom. In Round 1, a model account-openingdisclosure was tested with \"Risks\" on page 1 \nbut at the very bottom of the page. Participants were split regarding whether they preferred that information \npresented at the top of the form or at the bottom. For some participants, the information was more noticeable if \nlocated at the top of the disclosure, where it immediately caught their eye. Others did not pay much attention to that \ninformation once they realized that it did not contain any specific terms and rate that would apply to their HELOC. \nThose participants preferred to see \"Risks\" at the bottom of the form, which enabled them to get to specific terms \nand features being offered at the very beginning of the form. Regardless of the placement of the \"Risks\" section in \nthe table, most participants noticed and understood the disclosure about the risk of loss of the home in case of \ndefault and the disclosure about a creditor's right to terminate the plan in certain circumstances. In the Board staff's \noutreach, neither industry nor consumer group representatives indicated a preference for either placement. \nConsumer advocates suggested that for most consumers the placement of \"Risks\" at the bottom of the form would \nhave as much benefit as its placement at the top of the form, and emphasized the importance of highlighting key \nterms, such as the APR. As a result of the testing and the outreach efforts, the model early disclosure forms and the \nmodel account-opening form place \"Risks\" at the bottom of the form.\n\nFindings Related to the HELOC Brochure and Key Questions Document\n\n. Participants who were shown the HELOC brochure generally indicated that they found the document useful and \nthought the information it contained was important--particularly for consumers with little experience with home \nequity products. An almost universal criticism among participants about the HELOC brochure was that it was too \nlong. As a result, several participants indicated they would be unlikely to read it Several participants indicated that \nthey would be more likely to read a shorter and more concise disclosure.\n\n. Following Round 1, ICF Macro developed a one-page disclosure titled \"Key Questions to Ask About Home Equity \nLines of Credit.\" The goal was to summarize the most important information in the HELOC brochure in a shorter, \nmore consumer-friendly format. The Key Questions disclosure tested extremely well with participants; all indicated \nthat they would find it useful, and most found it very clear and easy to read. As a result, the Board is proposing to \nrequire lenders to provide the Key Questions document to prospective borrowers instead of the HELOC brochure. \nWhile several different questions were tested in different rounds, the questions listed and answered on the final \nproposed version are:\n\n. Can my interest rate increase?\n\n. Can my minimum payment increase?\n\n. When can I borrow money?\n\n. How soon do I have to pay off my balance?\n\n. Will I owe a balloon payment?\n\n. Do I have to pay any fees?\n\n. Should I get a home equity loan instead of a line of credit?\n\nCHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1968, Congress enacted the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to protect consumers by requiring lenders to provide key \npieces of information to consumers at various points in time Congress assigned the Federal Reserve Board (the \n\"Board\") the responsibility of implementing TILA, and the Board currently does so through Regulation Z.\n\nIn 2004, the Board began the process of reviewing Regulation Z to determine whether revisions were necessary. In \nJanuary 2009, the Board finalized amendments to Regulation Z rules applicable to open-end (not home secured) \ncredit (e.g., general purpose credit cards, merchant-specific credit plans, and overdraft lines of credit). 3 The Board \nis currently in the process of reviewing disclosures under Regulation Z related to home-secured open-end credit--\nnamely, home equity lines of credit, and closed-end mortgage disclosures. This report is related to the Board's \nreview of disclosures for closed-end mortgage loans. One of the goals of this review is to ensure that the amended \nregulations lead to improved disclosures that consumers would most likely pay attention to, understand, and be \nable to use in their decision-making.\n\nThis report addresses to the Board's review of disclosures related to HELOCs. One of the goals of this review is to \nensure that the regulations lead to disclosures that consumers would most likely pay attention to, understand, and \nbe able to use in their decision-making.\n\nUnder Regulation Z, HELOC borrowers must receive the following three types of disclosures, in addition to others:\n\n. Application Disclosure: The regulation currently requires that an application disclosure be provided to potential \nborrowers at the time an application for a HELOC is provided. This disclosure provides details about the lender's \nHELOC plan, including the length of the draw and repayment periods; how the minimum required payment is \ncalculated; payment examples; and what fees are charged by the lender to open, use, or maintain the plan. \nBecause this disclosure is provided before underwriting takes place, this disclosure does not include information \nthat is dependent upon a borrower's creditworthiness, such as the annual percentage rate (\"APR\") that the lender \nwill offer.\n\n. \"What You Need to Know About Home Equity Lines of Credit\" Brochure: This booklet (the \"HELOC \nbrochure\") is produced by the Board and has no transaction-or program-specific information. It provides consumers \nwith general information about HELOCs and how they work, as well as a glossary of relevant terms, and a \ndescription of various features that can apply to HELOCs. The Board currently requires lenders to provide this \nbrochure to consumers at the same time as the application disclosure.\n\n. Account-Opening Disclosure: The regulation currently requires that an account-openingdisclosure be provided \nto potential borrowers before they commit to opening a HELOC. This disclosure includes detailed transaction-\nspecific information, including the APR and fees that will be charged.\n\nIn December 2008, the Board contracted with ICF Macro to assist the Board with its review and revision of these \ndisclosure forms. ICF Macro is a research and evaluation company with expertise in the design and cognitive \ntesting of effectiveconsumer communication materials. ICF Macro worked with the Board on its review of credit card \ndisclosures and is currently contributing to its review of Regulation Z rules for closed-endmortgagedisclosures.\n\nSince December 2008, ICF Macro has conducted five rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews with a total of 50 \nparticipants. For each round, ICF Macro developed a set of model disclosure forms to be tested. Interview \n\n3 As of the writing of this report, the Board is in the process of revising these rules in light of legislation passed by Congress in \nMay 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nparticipants were asked to review model forms and provide their reactions, and were then asked a series of \nquestions designed to test their understanding of the content. Data were collected on which elements and features \nof each form were most successful in providing information clearly and effectively. The findings from each round of \ninterviews were incorporated in revisions to the model forms for the following round of testing.\n\nThe findings from the consumertesting informed the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z rules for HELOCs, \nwhich the Board will publish for public comment in July 2009, together with the model forms.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nTesting of the model forms was carried out through five rounds of interviews, as shown in Table 1. Before each \nround of interviews, ICF Macro developed model disclosures for testing. In most cases, multiple versions of each \ntype of disclosure were developed so that the impact of varying language or format could be studied. The Board \nstaff attended all rounds of testing. After each round, ICF Macro briefed Board staff on key findings, as well as their \nimplications for form design and layout. These results were then used to create revised forms for use in the next \nround of testing.\n\nTable 1: Timeline of Cognitive Testing\n\nLocation Dates Number of Interviews\nRound 1 Bethesda, MD December 17-18, 2008 10\nRound 2 Los Angeles, CA February 11-12. 2009 10\nRound 3 Chicago, IL March 24-25, 2009 10\nRound 4 Denver, CO April 14-15, 2009 10\nRound 5 Bethesda, MD May 5-6, 2009 10\n\nParticipants in each of the four locations were recruited by telephone using a structured screening instrument in \norder to ensure the selection of a range of participants in terms of gender, age, and ethnicity. Most participants had \nHELOCs, while some considered getting a HELOC but opted instead for a home equity loan. A few participants did \nnot have a home equity loan or HELOC, but had considered a HELOC in the past five years. Participants were \nscreened out if they worked for a bank or other financial institution, or if they worked in the real estate or mortgage \nindustry. The screening criteria that were used were essentially the same in each location, although the recruiting \nquotas changed slightly in each round to provide for a diverse and representative participant pool. A sample \nrecruitment screening instrument is included as Appendix A, and a summary of participants' background and \ndemographic information can be found in Appendix B.\n\nInterviews in each location were approximately 90 minutes long. While the interview guide varied between rounds, \nthe general structure of these interviews was very similar. Participants were given a disclosure form and asked to \n\"think aloud\" while they went through the document, indicating whenever they found something surprising, \ninteresting, or confusing. Following this \"think aloud\" process, each respondent was asked specific questions about \nthe information on the disclosure to determine how well he or she could find and interpret the content. The \nparticipant would then be given another disclosure form--either a new version of the same disclosure type, or a new \ntype altogether--and the interviewer would take them through the same process.\n\nVariations in the interview protocol, as well as a description of the forms that were shown to participants, is \nprovided in the description of each round of findings in Chapter III.\n\nCHAPTER II: GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR DISCLOSURE DESIGN\n\n\n\nMuch of ICF Macro's design of revised disclosures was based directly on findings from cognitive testing. This \nreliance on direct consumer research is an important strategy for ensuring that disclosure forms are useful and \nunderstandable to their intended audiences. At the same time, there are a number of general principles to which \nICF Macro's designers try to adhere whenever engaged in this or similar projects. These principals include:\n\n. Use plain language. Jargon and technical language should be avoided whenever possible, and replaced with \nwords that are more easily understood by consumers. The use of simple language is particularly important in the \ncontext of disclosures, because consumers at the greatest risk of being taken advantage of are often those with \nlower literacy levels. While readability metrics (such as the \"grade level\" of the writing) can be useful in this respect, \nthe best way to determine whether language is truly understandable is through direct consumer testing.\n\n. Prioritize information, and structure disclosures so that the most important information for consumers is \neasiest for them to find. Consumers frequently do not read disclosures carefully; those who do look at them often \nskim them quickly to look for a few key pieces of information. If consumers cannot quickly find the information they \nare looking for, they are likely to become frustrated and give up. Therefore, before any design work can begin there \nmust be some discussion to identify the most important pieces of information on the form. Those should be located \nmost prominently on the disclosure, to increase the likelihood that even consumers who skim the form quickly can \nfind and understand that information.\n\n. Provide information in a format that makes it easy to compare terms between disclosures. One purpose of \nHELOC disclosures--particularly early disclosures--is to serve as a tool to help consumers compare products from \ndifferent lenders. Narrative text is often difficult to compare in this way, because consumers cannot always identify \nthe equivalent information between forms. Providing information in more structured formats, such as tables with \nconsistent labels and headings, facilitates this kind of shopping comparison.\n\n. Keep language and design elements consistent between forms so that information can be tracked over \ntime. In a disclosure regime like that currently in place for HELOCs, consumers get information about the product \nfor which they are applying at multiple points in time One goal of these disclosures is to help consumers track the \nterms of their line of credit at each stage in the process (from application to closing, for example) to make sure \nnothing changes without their knowledge. To facilitate this, the structure and formatting of disclosure elements, as \nwell as the language that is used to describe various aspects of the product, should be made consistent between \ndisclosures whenever possible.\n\n. Use headings and titles to make documents more navigable, and to help consumers find the information \nthey are looking for. When large amounts of text are included, plain language headings should be used to \ndistinguish sections on different topics. In tables, rows and columns should have short, easy-to-read titles that \naccurately describe the information that is provided. This allows consumers to find information that they are looking \nfor quickly and efficiently, and decreases the likelihood that they will become distracted by unrelated text.\n\n. Group related concepts and figures. HELOC disclosures contain a great deal of disparate information about a \ncomplex financial product. Consumers are likely to find it easier to absorb and make sense of the information if it is \ngrouped in a logical way so they do not have to constantly shift their mindset as they read. For example, the revised \nHELOC disclosures groups several pieces of information about potential risks into the same section of the form, \nwhereas in most disclosures that are currently in use these references appear in multiple places.\n\n\n\n. Build off of prior research whenever possible. While each type of disclosure is different, findings from cognitive \ntesting can often translate between different documents. The applicability of a disclosure format in a new context \nshould always be confirmed through cognitive testing, but it often provides a useful starting point. For example, the \ntabular structure of revised early and account-opening forms--as well as some of the wording of information related \nto APRs--was originally developed in a project ICF Macro conducted for the Board related to credit card \ndisclosures.\n\nCHAPTER III: TESTING OF REVISED DISCLOSURE FORMS\n\nINTERVIEWS IN BETHESDA, MARYLAND (DECEMBER 17-18, 2008)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nThe first round of 10 cognitive interviews was conducted in Bethesda, Maryland on December 17 and 18, 2008. The \nprimary focus of this round was to test consumer comprehension of two different formats for a home equity line of \ncredit disclosure form--a text-based form similar to those currently in use, and a form using less text and a more \nstructured tabular framework.\n\nFour forms were tested in Bethesda:\n\n. An application disclosure in primarily narrative form, designed to be representative of disclosure documents \ncurrently in use;\n\n. A new account-opening disclosure in tabular form, developed by ICF Macro to present more specific information \nabout HELOC terms being offered;\n\n. A page providing information about sample payments, titled \"Payment Examples\"; and\n\n. The Federal Reserve Board brochure \"What You Should Know About Home Equity Lines of Credit\" (referred to in \nthis report as the \"HELOC brochure\").\n\nThe first three forms can be found in Appendix C to this report. The HELOC brochure can be found at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/equity/homeequity.pdf.\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Interview participants were asked to review the application disclosure that is very similar to forms currently in use, \nand a new account-opening disclosure developed by ICF Macro. They were shown these two forms in a rotating \norder, to minimize learning effects. After reviewing each disclosure, participants were asked a series of questions \ndesigned to test their comprehension of the content.\n\n. Next, participants were shown a page containing information about sample payments. The goal of this section of \nthe interview was to understand what participants understood about the page, as well as to gather data on what \ntype of payment information would be most useful to them.\n\n. Finally, participants were presented with the Federal Reserve Board brochure \"What You Should Know About \nHome Equity Lines of Credit\" (the \"HELOC brochure\") and asked to assess its usefulness and clarity.\n\n\n\nKey interview Findings\n\nPrevious Experience with HELOCs\n\n. Nine of the 10 participants had obtained HELOCs in the past, while one had opted for a home equity loan because \nhe found that interest rates were lower on that product.\n\n. Of the 9 who had HELOCs, only 1 participant had considered getting a home equity loan instead. Others indicated \nthat they had not, because they did not know how much money they were going to need when they opened their \nline of credit. A number of participants, however, were unclear about the difference between a HELOC and home \nequity loan until the distinction was explained to them. Some of these participants did not fully understand whether \nthey had a home equity loan or a HELOC. Only one participant had ever heard the acronym \"HELOC\" prior to being \nrecruited for this project.\n\n. Almost all participants said that their HELOCs were originated either by their original mortgage provider, a prior \nlender, or through a bank with which they had an existing banking relationship. Only one participant indicated that \nhe actively shopped among lenders for a HELOC; he eventually decided against getting a HELOC because the fees \nwere too high.\n\n. Few of the participants indicated that they had conducted research on HELOCs before applying for one. Among \nthose who did, most said that they gathered information by talking to family and friends, or by talking to their primary \nmortgage lender.\n\n. When participants were asked what advice they would give to a friend or family member who was interested in \ngetting a HELOC, the most common response was to use a lender that was trustworthy. Only one participant \nmentioned shopping among lenders when asked this question.\n\nApplication Disclosure\n\nInitial Reactions\n\n. On Day 1, when the application disclosure form was the first form reviewed, all 5 participants were extremely \nconfused by the form.\n\n. All 10 participants had difficulty reading the application disclosure form, and most did not read all the way to the \nend.\n\n. On Day 2, when the application disclosure was the second form reviewed, participants were slightly less confused \nby the form because they had seen the tabular format of the account-opening form first, and therefore had some \nidea about what type of information the application disclosure form was attempting to convey.\n\n. Despite the fact that participants on Day 2 saw the tabular account-opening form prior to seeing the application \ndisclosure form, all 5 of them still had difficulty understanding the application disclosure.\n\n\n\n. Two of the participants said that they would not read such a document if it was given to them, because it was so \ndifficult to read.\n\n. When asked to compare the text-based application disclosure with the tabular account-opening disclosure, 8 of \nthe 10 respondents said that they preferred the tabular format because the tables made it easier to find information. \nThe remaining two participants stated that they prefer the textual format of the application disclosure because it \nappeared to provide more information.\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n. Most of the participants appeared to have a general understanding of what the term \"index\" meant. Most were also \nable to identify the Prime Rate as the index for the loan being described in the form.\n\n. Two participants were confused by the statement that the interest rate would be based on the Prime Rate \"as \npublished in the Wall Street Journal.\" One commented that he did not know why this would be relevant to him, while \nthe other mistakenly thought this meant he would have to subscribe to the Wall Street Journal in order to know what \nhis interest rate was.\n\n. Fewer participants understood the term \"margin\" as it was used in the form. About half generally understood that it \nwas an additional percentage that would be added to the index by the lender.\n\n. Most participants understood that the rate was variable. Most got this information from the text of the disclosure, \nwhile one got it from the Historical Example table at the end of the form.\n\n. All but one of the participants correctly identified the maximum rate as 24.99%. However, most of them felt that it \nwas very unlikely the rate would ever get this high.\n\nFees\n\n. Everyone understood that fees would be charged, and that they would total between $ 0 and $ 1,000 (the amounts \nshown on the form).\n\nDraw and Repayment Periods\n\n. When reading the application form, participants were very confused by the distinction between a \"draw period\" and \na \"repayment period.\" Almost none of them could explain what a \"draw period\" was; no one had heard of this term \nbefore.\n\n. Because they had not been exposed to this concept previously, participants had a great deal of difficulty \nunderstanding the timing of the draw and repayment periods. Some assumed that the draw and repayment periods \nran concurrently, while others indicated that the repayment period began when one first withdrew money from the \naccount. Even after considerable review and questioning from the interviewer, only a few participants eventually \nunderstood that the repayment period began when the draw period ended.\n\n . Several of the participants confused the repayment period with the option to extend the draw period.\n\n\n\nBalloon Payment\n\n. After their review of the application disclosure, most participants understood that they could owe a balloon \npayment. However, three participants could not explain what a balloon payment was, or in what situation they would \nowe one.\n\nInformation about Potential Risks\n\n. All participants understood that they could lose their home if they did not meet their loan obligations. This \nunderstanding was based on prior knowledge, however, rather than on the \"Security Interest\" statement they read \non the form. In fact, several skipped the \"Security Interest\" statement when reading the disclosure.\n\n. One participant suggested that this section of the form be given a clearer title, such as \"Risk of Home Loss.\" This, \nhe felt, would increase the likelihood that potential borrowers would pay attention to it.\n\nHistorical Example Table\n\n. Many participants understood that the purpose of the historical payment example was to provide information to the \nconsumer about how interest rates could change over time. However, several did not realize that the information in \nthe table was based upon actual historical rates. These participants instead thought that the table provided a \nhypothetical example of what could happen in the future--despite the fact that the table referred to the years 1991 to \n2005. Some participants concluded that the information in the table represented what their monthly payments would \nbe if they were to open a HELOC account.\n\n. Almost all participants understood that their payment would be lower when the rate was lower. However, based on \nresponses to other questions it is likely that participants understood this fact even before reading the form.\n\n. None of the participants on Day 1 understood that the reason payments were higher during the repayment period \nthan during the draw period was because the payment calculation method changed (i.e., payments during the draw \nperiod included interest only whereas payments during the repayment period included principal and interest). \nComprehension was higher on Day 2, because of learning effects from the account-opening disclosure that was \nshown first on Day 2.\n\nAccount-Opening Disclosure\n\nInitial Reactions\n\nParticipants on Day 1 felt very positively about this form, since most had struggled to understand the application \ndisclosure. Several commented that they found the account-opening disclosure much easier to read and \nunderstand.\n\n . One participant commented that he liked having the credit limit and interest rate information in bold, large print so \nthat it stands out from the rest of the text.\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n\n\n. All participants were able to identify the initial APR easily. Everyone also understood that the interest rate would \nchange, and that it would change depending on the Prime Rate.\n\n. Almost all participants understood that the maximum rate was 24.99%. One mistakenly thought that 24.99% \nrepresented the highest the Prime Rate could go, and assumed that the maximum rate for the HELOC would be \n26.99% (i.e., 24.99% plus 2% margin).\n\n. Most participants understood the meaning of the sentence, \"The APR on a HELOC does not include costs other \nthan interest.\" However, a few misinterpreted this information; for example, one participant thought this statement \nwas indicating that he would be charged no fees for opening a line of credit. Even those who did understand what \nthe statement meant could not indicate why this information would be on the form, or how they would use this \ninformation. Participants did not understand that the purpose of this statement was to make clear to participants that \nAPRs on these products cannot be directly compared to those of closed-end loans, which do include fees.\n\nFees\n\n. Almost all participants understood that there would be fees associated with opening a HELOC, and could also \nidentify the amount of the fees.\n\n. One participant suggested that the fees should be called \"closing costs\" rather than \"account opening costs,\" \nbecause that term was more familiar to her.\n\n. All participants understood that if they closed the account before the end of the first three years, an early \ntermination fee would apply.\n\nDraw and Repayment Periods\n\n. As with the application disclosure form, there was considerable confusion about the timing of the draw period and \nthe repayment period. Several individuals mistakenly thought that the two periods occurred concurrently.\n\n. One participant mistakenly thought that no money would need to be repaid during the draw period, and that all \npayments would take place during the repayment period.\n\n. One participant suggested that information about the draw and repayment periods be provided in a chart, to make \nit easier to see the differences between them. Another recommended including a timeline on the form to explain the \ntiming of the two periods.\n\n Balloon Payment\n\n. Most participants understood that they would owe a balloon payment, just as they did when looking at the \napplication disclosure. However, participants' comprehension of the concept of a balloon payment seemed to be \nhigher when they were looking at the account-opening disclosure.\n\nInformation about Potential Risks\n\n\n\n. All participants also understood that the bank had the right to terminate the loan early, but several objected to this \nand said they would \"not be interested\" in a loan that carried that condition. Almost none of the participants had \nnoticed this information in the application disclosure.\n\nMinimum Loan Amount\n\n. While most participants understood intuitively that the \"minimum draw\" referred to the smallest amount that could \nbe taken out at a given time, one woman initially interpreted this to mean that this was the minimum draw per \nmonth, rather than per transaction.\n\nReview of Payment Example\n\nInitial Reactions\n\n. Several participants looked immediately at the chart, without first reading the explanatory text at the top. \"There is \nso much written at the top that you feel like you want to jump down to here [tables],\" said one man.\n\n. Only a few of the participants realized that the minimum payments during the draw period included interest only \nand no principal.\n\n. Several participants were confused by the numbers of payments that were provided on the page. For example, \nabout half struggled to understand why the 20-year repayment period was listed as \"239 payments\" (with the last \npayment shown as a separate balloon payment), while others were unable to calculate the term of the HELOC \nfrom the number of payments.\n\n. One participant commented that the tables were trying to convey too many variables at once (i.e., the impact on \npayments of varying interest rates, draw vs. repayment period, and size of balance). He suggested that payment \nexamples could be better provided through an interactive website.\n\nUnderstanding of Payment Information\n\n. All participants understood the difference between the two columns of payments shown--that is, that the payment \nwould vary based on the interest rate.\n\n. Those participants who skipped directly to the table without reading the explanatory text first were completely \nconfused as to why the payments listed for the draw and repayment periods  had such different payment amounts. \nOnce they were directed to read the text, many eventually understood that the difference in payments was due to \nthe fact that the payments during the draw period were interest-only, although some understood this only with great \ndifficulty.\n\n. None of the participants understood why a range of payments was listed for the repayment period in the first \ncolumn. This was intended to show the fact that payments would decrease over time as the principal was paid off, \nbut no participants could ascertain this from the form. Most participants incorrectly assumed that the range of \npayments reflected a fluctuation in interest rates over that time period. Many participants also commented that the \nrange should be listed from lowest to highest.\n\n\n\n. When asked what their minimum monthly payment would be for a $ 30,000 balance, almost all participants were \nable to multiply by three the amounts shown for a $ 10,000 balance, while one divided by two the amounts shown \nin the $ 80,000 table and then assumed the payment on $ 30,000 would be \"a little less.\" At least one participant did \nnot have any idea how to estimate what the payments would be on $ 30,000 since the table showed payments \nbased on a $ 10,000 balance and an $ 80,000 balance.\n\nBalloon Payment\n\n. Participants were much more likely to understand from this form that a balloon payment would be owed at the end \nof the repayment period than they were after reading the application disclosure. However, this was likely due, at \nleast in part, to learning effects, since all participants saw the application disclosure before the Payment Examples \npage.\n\n. Several participants expressed surprise that they might owe thousands of dollars at the end of the repayment \nperiod, even if they made minimum payments throughout.\n\nReview of HELOC Brochure\n\n. None of the participants remembered having ever seen the HELOC brochure before, even those who had \npreviously opened HELOCs.\n\n. The reaction to the brochure was generally favorable. One participant said that it was a \"good first step\" to \nproviding the information that consumers needed. Several said that the brochure would be particularly useful for \npeople who were considering opening their first HELOC. One participant, however, called the document \"dry and \nboring.\"\n\n. Several participants commented that while the content of the HELOC brochure was useful, they probably would \nnot read it if they received it from a lender. The two most common reasons given were that the document was too \nlong and would take too much time to read, and that they felt they already knew whatever they needed about the \nproduct. The sentiment about the HELOC brochure being too long was shared even by many participants who \notherwise viewed the brochure very favorably.\n\n . Most participants said that the glossary was particularly useful to them--especially the definitions of those terms, \nlike index and margin, which they had struggled to understand on the disclosure forms they were shown. Several \nparticipants were specifically looking for definitions of draw and repayment periods, and, when they were unable to \nfind them, commented that the glossary should define these two terms since they are not intuitive.\n\n. The \"shopping worksheet\" in the brochure received mixed responses. Some said that the worksheet would be \nuseful and that they would definitely use it, while others said they probably would not. Participants' enthusiasm for \nthe worksheet was generally dampened by the fact that few seemed to believe it was important to shop between \ndifferent lenders.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nGeneral Structure of the Application Disclosure\n\n\n\n. Participants had a great deal of difficulty comprehending the application disclosure, largely because the document \nwas so text-heavy. Participants also expressed a preference for a tabular format, such as was used in the account-\nopening disclosure. In addition, the use of a tabular format seemed to improve participants' understanding of \nseveral aspects of the forms, such as the balloon payment. For these reasons, the decision was made to develop a \ntabular application disclosure to be tested in the next round of interviews as an alternative to the current text-based \nversion.\n\ninformation about Interest Rates\n\n. All participants were unsure how to use the statement that \"The APR on a HELOC does not include costs other \nthan interest.\" Since this statement is currently required by Regulation Z and the statute, a decision was made to \ntest it with more context in the next round to provide a framework that would increase consumer comprehension.\n\nDraw and Repayment Periods\n\n. Because several participants had difficulty understanding the distinction between the draw and repayment periods, \nthese periods were renamed in forms for the next round. The \"repayment period\" was renamed the \"payoff period\" \nand two new labels for the \"draw period\" were tested in the next round: \"withdrawal period\" and \"borrowing period.\"\n\n. When looking at the Payment Examples page, participants had a great deal of trouble distinguishing the draw and \nrepayment periods. One of the primary goals of the forms developed for the next round was to better describe how \nthese two periods are distinct, and the impact of each on the required monthly payments.\n\n. Several participants did not understand from reading the forms that the draw and repayment periods were \nconsecutive, rather than concurrent. Forms for the next round highlighted the start and end dates of these two \nperiods to emphasize the fact that they are distinct and do not overlap.\n\n . Because the word \"draw\" was not intuitively understood by participants i.e., as in \"Minimum Draw\"), this word was \nreplaced with \"loan.\"\n\nInformation about Payments\n\n. Because it was not clear that participants needed to be shown payment examples for two different balances, and \nbecause almost all participants were able to estimate payments for different balances from sample payments on $ \n10,000, forms for the next round only provided sample payments for a single hypothetical balance of $ 10,000.\n\n. Almost all participants were confused by the fact that the payment during the repayment period was listed as a \nrange. Two different ways of addressing this issue were tested in the next round. Some forms indicated that the \npayment was decreasing over time (e.g., \"$ 100.00 decreasing to $ 30.48\"). Other forms simply said that the \npayment during that period would be \"up to $ 100.00.\"\n\n. Several participants had difficulty interpreting the numbers of payments provided in the Payment Examples page. \nFor example, they were not able to easily add up the number of payments to calculate the term of the HELOC. \nBecause it was unclear that this information would be useful to consumers, the number of payments was not \nincluded on subsequent forms.\n\n\n\n. In order to provide participants with more information about how their payment might vary based on changes in \ntheir interest rate, the forms used in the next round of testing showed sample payments for four different interest \nrates (including the minimum and maximum rates under the plan), rather than two.\n\nInformation about Potential Risks\n\n. To make it easier to read for consumers, most of the information provided in the \"Other Important Information\" \nsection of the account-opening disclosure was restructured into a section labeled \"Risks.\" This section was also \nincluded in the tabular version of the application disclosure that was tested in the next round.\n\n. Because some participants had difficulty understanding the section of text labeled \"Our Right to Terminate or \nReduce Your Line of Credit,\" the information in this section was bulleted in all subsequent forms.\n\nHistorical Example Table\n\n. A significant number of participants in this round had difficulty understanding the Historical Example table. For \nexample, several did not even understand that this table was providing historical information about rates. Because \nof this confusion, some of the forms tested in the next round did not include this table.\n\n HELOC Brochure\n\n. Because several of the participants in this round commented that they might not read the HELOC brochure \nbecause of its length, the decision was made to develop a new, shorter early disclosure highlighting important \nfeatures of HELOCs. This new disclosure was tested in the following round of interviews.\n\nINTERVIEWS IN LOS ANGELES, CA (FEBRUARY 11-12, 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nThe second round of 10 cognitive interviews was conducted in Los Angeles, California on February 11 and 12, \n2009. The primary focus of this round was to test consumer comprehension of an array of home equity line of credit \ndisclosure forms. The goal was to supplement first round findings in regards to basic formatting and to experiment \nwith different approaches to disclosing more complex features of HELOCs, such as payment examples and the \ndifference between draw and repayment periods. This round also included the testing of a new one-page early \ndisclosure form about HELOCs.\n\nEight forms were tested in Los Angeles, all of which are provided in Appendix C:\n\n. An application disclosure form similar to that used in the first round of testing, designed to be representative of \ndisclosure documents currently in use (AD-1);\n\n. Two application disclosure forms that included similar information to AD-1, but in a new tabular format (AD-2A and \nAD-2B); n4\n\n\n\n. Two other application disclosure forms similar to Forms 2A and 2B except that several statutorily required \nrequirements were relaxed (AD-3A and AD-3B);\n\n. Account-opening forms in two different formats (AO-A and AO-B); and\n\n. A new disclosure titled \"6 Key Questions to Ask About Home Equity Lines of Credit,\" that was designed to be \nprovided to consumers with an application.\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Each interview participant was asked to review AD-1 and one of the two AD-2 forms. They were shown these two \nforms in a rotating order, to minimize learning effects. The goal of this portion of the interview was to assess \nwhether the new tabular format improved participants' comprehension of this information.\n\n . Next, participants were shown one of the AD-3 forms. The differences between AD-2 and AD-3 were pointed out \nto participants, who were asked to compare each aspect of the two forms in terms of their usefulness.\n\n. Participants were then shown both Forms AO-A and AO-B. In addition to answering questions testing their \ncomprehension of the information, participants were also asked to comment on the differences in format between \nthe two forms.\n\n. Finally, participants were presented with a new one-page early disclosure titled \"6 Key Questions to Ask About \nHome Equity Lines of Credit\" (the \"Key Questions\" disclosure). After being shown this new disclosure, participants \nwere asked questions to test their understanding of the content and solicit feedback on the document's usefulness.\n\nKey Interview Findings\n\nPrevious Experience with HELOCs\n\n. During the initial portion of the interview, it was clear that several participants did not understand the difference \nbetween a home equity loan and a HELOC. For example, one person initially indicated that she had a home equity \nloan, but after the difference was explained to her she realized that she actually had a HELOC.\n\n. Of the eight participants who had previously obtained a HELOC, only one had talked to several lenders before \nopening the line of credit. The rest either used the same lender who had financed their first mortgage, or a lender \nwith whom they had a prior business relationship. The one participant who had shopped for a HELOC chose the \nlender who offered the lowest interest rate.\n\n. Of the eight participants who had obtained HELOCs, none had considered instead getting a closed-end home \nequity loan. Most indicated that a closed-end loan would not have been appropriate for them, because they did not \nknow in advance how much money they were going to need to access. Two participants who had used \"piggy-\nback\" HELOCs to purchase a house indicated that they had not been given a choice by their lenders whether to \ninstead get a second mortgage.\n\nApplication Disclosures (AD-9 and AD-2)\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n. Four of the 10 participants incorrectly thought that AD-1 identified a specific interest rate for their line of credit. 5 \nTwo thought that their interest rate would be 24.99%, the maximum rate listed. Two others thought that their rate \n\n5 Because AD-1 was an applicationdisclosure that would have been provided before any underwriting had taken place, the \ndisclosure did not indicate what the interest rate would be, consistent with the current Regulation Z requirements.\n\n \n\n\n\nwould be 8.5% because this figure was used in the minimum payment example shown on the form. When \nreviewing AD-2, however, all  10 participants were able to correctly identify the range of interest rates they might be \noffered if they applied.. Only three of the 10 participants understood after reading AD-1 that their interest rate would \nbe determined based on an index plus a margin. When asked to find this information on the form, most participants \nwere unsure in which section of text to look.\n\n. All but one of the participants understood from AD-2 that the interest rate would be determined by the Prime Rate \nplus a margin. All but one also understood that the size of the margin would be determined by their \ncreditworthiness.\n\n. Eight of the 10 participants understood that the loan described in AD-1 had a variable interest rate. All 10 \nparticipants understood from form AD-2 that the interest rate would be variable.\n\n. Six of the 10 participants were able to find the maximum interest rate on AD-1 without assistance from the \ninterviewer, compared to eight of 10 who were looking at AD-2.\n\n. AD-2 included a statement that the APR \"does not include fees other than interest (unlike the APRs for traditional \nmortgages and home equity loans, which include some closing costs).\" Most participants generally understood that \nthis statement meant that the APR represented the costs associated with interest. However, none understood the \ntext in parentheses relating to the APRs for closed-end products. None were also able to articulate why this \nstatement might be on the form or how the information might be useful to them.\n\nInformation about Payments\n\n. All participants were able to identify the initial monthly payment for a balance of $ 10,000 and an interest rate of \n6.0%, regardless of whether they were looking at AD-1 or AD-2. All answered the question either by looking at the \nHistorical Example or Minimum Monthly Payment tables.\n\nFees\n\n. All 10 participants understood that they would have to pay fees to take out a line of credit, and could identify what \nthe amount of the fees might be. Both AD-1 and AD-2 appeared to provide this information equally clearly.\n\n. A few participants commented that they would like a more detailed breakdown of account-opening fees at the \napplication stage, rather than an aggregate amount.\n\nWithdrawal/Borrowing and Payoff Periods\n\n. Of the five participants who saw AD-1 first, only two understood that they would have 10 years to borrow from their \nline of credit and an additional 10 years to pay it off. One participant knew that each period was 10 years long, but \nthought that they might run concurrently.\n\n . Of the five participants who saw AD-2 first, again only two understood the exact timing of the \nwithdrawal/borrowing and payoff periods. One did not see any reference to the payoff period, while another \nmistakenly thought that the line would have to be paid off before the payoff period began.\n\n. When looking at AD-2, several participants had difficulty determining how long the two periods were because they \nwere shown as ranges of years (e.g., 2009-2018) as opposed to a time frame (e.g., 10 years).\n\n \n\n\n\n. Few participants understood that the minimum payments during the withdrawal/borrowing period would cover only \ninterest and no principal. Only one of five participants who saw AD-1 first understood this fact, as did two of five \nwho saw AD-2 first.\n\n. With both AD-1 and AD-2, seven of the 10 participants understood that they would not be able to withdraw funds \nduring the payoff period. Neither form appeared to be noticeably more effective at communicating this information.\n\n. Only three of the 10 participants understood that a range of minimum payments was shown during the payoff \nperiod because the payment would change as the principal was paid off. Most incorrectly thought that the reason a \nrange of payments was provided was that the payment might vary based on changes in interest rates.\n\nBalloon Payment\n\n. Most participants understood what a balloon payment was, and why it would be due at the end of the HELOC \nterm. Participants' comprehension of balloon payment did not seem to depend on whether they were looking at AD-\n1 or AD-2.\n\n. Only a few participants realized that the loan described in AD-1 could have a balloon payment at the end. When \nreading AD-2, however, most understood that there could be a balloon payment.\n\nInformation about Potential Risks 6. Three of the five participants who were shown AD-1 first understood that they \ncould lose their home if they did not make the minimum payments, compared to four of the five who were shown \nAD-2 first.\n\n. Seven participants understood from form AD-1 that the bank had the right to terminate the line of credit early. \nComprehension of AD-2 appeared to be slightly better; all participants but one could identify this information on this \nform.\n\n . Several participants commented that they would want to know the specific circumstances under which the bank \ncould end their line of credit. One participant suggested that the text be made even clearer; she suggested \nrephrasing the sentence as, \"The bank can call in your loan.\"\n\nHistorical Example Table\n\n. When asked to explain in their own words what the Historical Example Table showed, most participants said that \nit reiterated to them that the rate could change, and that if the rate changed their payment would change. However, \nas in the previous round several participants did not understand that the information in the Historical Example table \nwas based on actual historical information; they assumed that the figures shown were hypothetical.\n\n. When reviewing the Historical Example Table, a few participants commented that they found it useful to know how \nmuch the Prime Rate varied over time. One reason they felt this information was important was because it helped \nthem assess the likelihood that the interest rate would reach its maximum.\n\n. When asked how they would use the information in the Historical Example Table when evaluating a HELOC, \nseveral said they would not. Most others were unable to explain exactly how they would use the information, or why \nit would be useful to them.\n\n6 AD-2 and AD-3 provided information about potential risks in a separate section labeled \"Risks.\" In AD-1, this information was \nprovided in various places throughout the text.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMinimum Loan Amount\n\n. Almost all participants could identify the minimum loan amount for this line of credit, regardless of whether they \nwere shown AD-1 or AD-2.\n\nComparison of AD-2 and AD-3\n\n. Forms AD-2 and AD-3 used different phrasing to indicate that the payments during the repayment period would \nvary over time, due to the fact that the principal was being paid off. For example, AD-2 stated that at an interest rate \nof 6%, minimum payments during the payoff period would be \"$ 200.00 decreasing to $ 34.12,\" while AD-3 \nindicated that the payments would be \"up to $ 200.00.\" Six of the 10 participants indicated that they preferred the \nformer wording because it was more precise; two went so far as to call the \"up to\" language \"suspicious.\" One said \nthat she liked the latter wording because she did not understand what \"decreasing to\" meant, while the other \nparticipants did not have a preference. It should be noted, however, that understanding of this range of payments \nwas very low regardless of how it was phrased (see above).\n\n. The first page of the AD-2 forms listed information about risks first, and terms of the line of credit (i.e., credit limit, \nAPR, etc.) below. This order was reversed on the AD-3 forms. Seven of the 10 participants preferred having the risk \ninformation at the top; one thought it was \"good information to lead with,\" while another said that it \"makes you \nmore cautious.\" Three participants preferring having information about the credit limit and APR above the risks. One \nthought this was a more logical order for the information, while another described it as getting \"the sweet before the \nsour.\"\n\nComparison of AO-A and AO-B\n\n. AO-A used the term \"borrowing period\" to describe the initial period of time when money could be borrowed, while \nAO-B used the phrase \"withdrawal period.\" Participants overwhelmingly preferred the term \"borrowing period,\" \nbecause they felt it more accurately described how a line of credit worked.\n\n. Forms AO-A and AO-B described the APR in two different ways. AO-A explained that the rate would be equal to \nthe \"Prime Rate + 2%,\" while AO-B merely said that the interest rate would \"vary with the market monthly based on \nthe Prime Rate.\" Seven of the 10 participants indicated that they preferred the wording used in AO-A, because it \nwas more precise and gave more information. The remaining three participants did not express a preference \nbetween the two versions.\n\n. In the section of the account-openingdisclosure that described the borrowing and payoff periods and provided \nsample minimum payments, AO-A provided information about the two periods first, with payment information below. \nAO-B first provided a table of sample payments, and below the table explained the differences between the two \nperiods. Five of the participants preferred the order of information in AO-A because they felt the description of the \ntwo periods helped them interpret the numbers below. Two participants preferred the format of AO-B because it \nseemed more logical to them to start with the numbers and then provide the explanation. The remaining participants \ndid not have a strong preference between the two formats.\n\n. AO-A included estimated balloon payments in a separate column in the Minimum Monthly Payments table, while \nAO-B stated only that the balloon payment could be \"up to\" a certain amount. About half of the participants \npreferred to see the column of balloon payments (the format used in AO-A), while none preferred the AO-B format. \nThe other half of participants had no preference, in some cases because they did not understand what was meant \nby a \"balloon payment\" in either format.\n\n. AO-A provided minimum monthly payment examples for a balance of $ 10,000, while AO-B provided examples for \na balance of $ 50,000. Participants were split as to which they preferred; four said that they would prefer to receive \nexamples based on a $ 10,000 balance because it would be easy to use these figures to estimate a payment for a \nlarger balance, while three thought payments on a balance of $ 50,000 would be more realistic for consumers. One \n\n\n\nparticipant suggested that payment examples should be based on an assumption that the full credit limit has been \naccessed, so that borrowers would see the \"worst case scenario.\"\n\n. While participants were split in terms of their preference, payments based on $ 10,000 appeared to be more useful \nfor them. All five participants who were asked were able to accurately estimate what their payments would be for a \n$ 50,000 balance by multiplying the payments in AO-A by five. However, only two of five were able to divide the \npayments shown in AO-B by five to estimate what their payments would be on $ 10,000.\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. The one-page Key Questions disclosure was rated very highly by all participants. All said that they would find the \nform useful. Several commented that it was easy-to-read, and that it asked and answered important questions.\n\n. Participants generally understood the content of the disclosure and could explain to the interviewer what each of \nthe questions and answers meant.\n\n. In several cases, the Key Questions disclosure helped clarify concepts with which participants had previously \nstruggled. For example, one participant who had not understood balloon payments on the previous documents said \nthat she found the explanation on this form clear on the Key Questions document. Another participant indicated that \nthe explanation of borrowing and withdrawal periods helped her to understand that concept, which she had found \nconfusing while reading the other documents.\n\n. One participant commented that \"everyone knows they will have to pay fees\" to borrow money, and therefore \nrecommended that this question be replaced with another that would be more informative to consumers.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n. Participants continued to be confused by the text indicating that, unlike the APRs for traditional mortgages and \nhome equity loans, the APR for a HELOC does not include fees other than interest. Therefore, in forms for the next \nround this text was separated into its own row labeled \"Comparing APRs\" to try to indicate to consumers how they \ncould use this information.\n\nWithdrawal/Borrowing and Payoff Periods\n\n. Because most participants strongly preferred the term \"borrowing period\" to \"withdrawal period,\" this phrase was \nused in all subsequent forms.\n\n. The use of the term \"payoff period\" instead of \"repayment period\" did not have any noticeable effect on \nparticipants' understanding of this concept. In addition, following this round Board staff became concerned that the \nterm \"payoff period\" could imply to consumers that the balance would be paid off over time--when in fact paying off \nthe line of credit might require a sizable balloon payment. Therefore, all subsequent forms used the original term, \n\"repayment period.\"\n\n. In order to conserve space on the form, the format in which the differences between the two periods were \ndescribed was significantly revised for the next round. Rather than providing this information in a table on the \nsecond page, the distinctions between the borrowing and repayment periods were illustrated in a section on the first \npage titled \"Borrowing and Repayment Terms.\"\n\n . Participants in this round continued to have difficulty understanding the timing of the two loan periods. To address \nthis problem, forms for the next round indicated a section on the first page labeled \"Duration of Line of Credit\" that \n\n\n\nindicated the overall term of the HELOC, as well as the timing of the borrowing (\"Years 1 to 10\") and repayment \n(\"Years 11 to 20\") periods.\n\nInformation about Payments\n\n. Because of concerns that using a $ 10,000 hypothetical balance to calculate sample payments may lead to \nmisleadingly low payment amounts, the account-openingdisclosure tested in the next round showed payments for \nboth $ 10,000 and $ 80,000 balances (based on an $ 80,000 credit limit).\n\n. Because most participants preferred the phrasing of AD-2 (\"$ 200.00 decreasing to $ 34.12) to that of AD-3 (\"up to \n$ 200.00\") as a description of payments during the repayment period, forms for the next round used this wording.\n\n. To emphasize the difference in how payments are calculated in the borrowing and repayment periods (particularly \nthe fact that the borrowing period payments are interest-only), a short description of the calculation methods was \nadded to the title of the columns in the Sample Payments table.\n\n. Because it was unclear that providing sample payments for four different interest rates increased the usefulness of \nthe disclosure, and because of concerns that the number of dollar figures being shown on the form was confusing \nparticipants, all subsequent forms showed sample payments for only two rates--the current APR and the maximum \nAPR under the plan.\n\n. Because participants' awareness of the presence of a balloon payment was greater when this payment was \nincluded as a column in the sample payment table (as in AO-A), this format was used in forms for the next round.\n\nHistorical Example Table\n\n. As in the previous round, several participants continued to have difficulty understanding the Historical Example \nTable. Because of this, and because some participants indicated that they would not use the information it provided, \nthis table was removed from forms for the next round of testing, and tested as a separate stand-alone document so \nthat more detailed information could be collected about what participants take away from the table, and how useful \nthey find the information.\n\n. Although participants continued to have difficulty understanding the Historical Example table, one piece of \ninformation that some participants did find useful was the extent to which the index had varied over the past 15 \nyears. Therefore, in the next round this information was highlighted on the first page of all disclosures, under the \nheading \"Historical Changes to Prime Rate.\" This new section also included an estimate of how much their \npayment would have varied over that same time period.\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. Because participants responded so positively to the Key Questions disclosure, this form was revised and tested \nagain in subsequent rounds.\n\nINTERVIEWS IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS (MARCH 24-25, 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nThe third round of 10 cognitive interviews was conducted in Chicago, Illinois on March 24th and 25th, 2009. As in \nprevious rounds, the goal of this round of testing was to assess participants' understanding of revised disclosure \nforms, and to ask participants to compare different variations and indicate which they found clearer.\n\n\n\nPrior to the Chicago round of interviews, Board staff had some concerns about the usefulness of the application \ndisclosures for participants. ICF Macro's testing of closed-endmortgagedisclosures 7 conducted during the same \ntime period had shown that participants strongly disliked a disclosure form that lacked specific terms and features \nbecause such general information was not useful to them. Participants in closed-endtesting were shown an initial \nadjustable-rate mortgage (\"ARM\") program disclosure which, like the HELOC application disclosure, is provided \nwith the application and does not provide transaction-specific information. Overwhelmingly, participants indicated \nthat because of its lack of specificity, they would not find the initial ARM program disclosure useful and would be \nunlikely to read it. While participants in HELOC testing were not as vocal in their dislike of the application \ndisclosure, some of the same sentiment was apparent.To address this issue, Board staff decided to test a new type \nof disclosure: an \"early disclosure\" of transaction-specific information that would be provided no later than three \nbusiness days after application (similar to an early TILA disclosure for closed-end loans). The content of this \ndisclosure would be similar to the application disclosure, except that it would include information specific to the \nconsumer based on initial underwriting--most notably, the specific APR and credit limit. Model forms for the early \ndisclosure were tested for the first time in this round.\n\nIn addition to the shift from an application disclosure to an early disclosure of transaction-specific information, \nanother significant change in the forms for this round was that the early disclosures included information about \nmultiple payment plan options. In the first two rounds, application forms had only provided information about one \npayment plan.\n\nFive forms were tested in Chicago, all of which are provided in Appendix C:\n\n. Two new early disclosures (ID-1 & ID-2);\n\n. A revised account-openingdisclosure (AO-2);\n\n . A separate page displaying an Historical Example Table; and\n\n. A revised version of the Key Questions disclosure.\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Interview participants were first asked to review one of the two early disclosure forms, and were asked a series of \nquestions designed to test their comprehension of the content. They were then shown the other version of the early \ndisclosure, and asked to compare the usefulness and clarity of several aspects of the two forms. Participants were \nshown these two forms in a rotating order, to minimize learning effects.\n\n. Next, participants were shown the account openingdisclosure (form AO-2). Again, after reviewing this page they \nwere asked a series of questions designed to test comprehension.\n\n. Participants were shown the Historical Example Table and were asked a series of questions designed to assess \nthe usefulness and clarity of the information.\n\n. Finally, as in the previous round participants were shown the revised Key Questions document and asked to \nassess its usefulness and clarity.\n\nKey Interview Findings\n\nTiming of Early Disclosure\n\n7 ICF Macro will submit findings related to its design andtesting of closed-end mortgage disclosures to the Board under separate \ncover; this report will be published with the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z in July 2009.\n\n \n\n\n\n. When asked what kind of information they would want from a potential lender, all 10 participants said that they \nwould want to know what their interest rate would be.\n\n. In order to evaluate whether participants would find an application disclosure or an early transaction-specific \ndisclosure given soon after more useful, they were asked whether they would prefer to get more general \ninformation about their HELOC before they applied, or more specific information (including interest rate) after \napplication. All 10 participants said that they would prefer to receive a more specific disclosure soon after \napplication even if it meant that they received no official disclosure of terms before they applied. Participants \nindicated that their decision would be the same even if they had to pay an application fee and submit to a credit \ncheck in order to get this more specific disclosure.\n\nEarly Disclosures (ID-1 and ID-2)\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n. Most participants were able to identify the initial interest rate on their line of credit. Three, however, mistakenly \nthought that the rate shown (5.25%) did not include the margin.\n\n. All participants were able to identify the maximum APR, as well as how often their rate could change.\n\n . None of the participants understood the meaning of the statement under the heading \"Comparing APRs\" (i.e., \n\"The APR on a HELOC does not include fees other than interest. However, APR's for traditional mortgages and \nhome equity loans include some fees.\") Some people interpreted this statement to mean that they would not be \ncharged any fees, and were therefore confused when they subsequently read the information on the form about \nfees. None understood after reading the statement how the APRs for closed-end loans and HELOCs differed.\n\nFees\n\n. All participants were able to identify the amount of fees that they could be charged if they opened a line of credit.\n\n. As in the previous round, several participants commented that they would like a more detailed breakdown of their \naccount-opening fees, rather than an aggregate amount.\n\n. None of the participants noticed the information at the top of the disclosure indicating that they might be entitled to \na refund of fees that they had paid if they decided not to open the account. Several were surprised when this text \nwas pointed out to them.\n\nBorrowing and Repayment Periods\n\n. All participants clearly understood that the period of the line of credit was for twenty years, and that the recipient \nhad 10 years in which to borrow the money, and then an additional 10 years to pay it off. This was a clear \nimprovement over previous rounds, when participants had significant difficulty understanding the timing of the \nborrowing and repayment periods.\n\n. All participants understood that they could only borrow money during the borrowing period, and that they would \nhave to make payments during both the borrowing and repayment periods. Again, this was the first round in which \nthis was consistently understood by participants.\n\nPayment Plans/Plan Comparison\n\n. All participants understood that the purpose of the Payment Plans section was to provide borrowers with a choice \nabout how they would pay off their loans.\n\n\n\n. All but one of the participants were able to explain the relative advantages of Plans A and B--that is, that Plan B \noffered lower payments during the borrowing period, but that Plan A did not require a balloon payment and had a \nlower total of payments.\n\n. Most participants were also able to explain that the reason that payments during the borrowing period were lower \nunder Plan B was that these payments included only interest and no principal.\n\n. Nine of the 10 participants said that they would choose Plan A over Plan B. In most cases this was because they \ndid not want to owe a balloon payment, although those who were  shown ID-1 also considered the information in \nthe \"Total of All Payments\" column of the sample payments table (information about the total of payments was not \nshown on ID-2).\n\n. The five participants who saw ID-1 said that the information \"Total of All Payments\" column was very important to \nthem in choosing Plan A over Plan B.\n\nBalloon Payment\n\n. Almost all participants understood that the balloon payment would be owed at the end of the repayment period. \nAlthough all participants saw the reference to balloon payments on the disclosure forms, only half could explain \nexactly what a balloon payment was. Of the remaining participants, one indicated that it was \"a penalty of some \nkind,\" while another that a balloon payment was made up of interest that had not yet been paid. Others said that \nthey did not know what a balloon payment was, although all agreed that they would want to avoid paying one if \npossible. About half of the participants understood that under Plan B, the balloon payment could be avoided by \npaying more than the minimum payment earlier in the loan term. Other participants were unsure whether this \nballoon payment could be avoided.\n\n\"Risks\" Section\n\n. All participants understood based on their review of the early disclosure that the bank had the right to terminate \ntheir line of credit.\n\nFixed-Rate Loan Option\n\n. All of the participants understood from the form that they had the option to borrow up to $ 40,000 at a fixed rate. \nSeveral, however, were unsure whether or not this $ 40,000 was in addition to their $ 80,000 credit limit.\n\n. Two participants were surprised by the fixed-rate option, because they did not know that borrowers could have this \noption under a line of credit.\n\nMinimum Loan Amount\n\n. All participants were able to identify the minimum loan amount based on their review of the early disclosure form.\n\nComparison of ID-1 and ID-2\n\n. Most participants indicated that the Risks section should be located at the top of the first page (as in ID-1), rather \nthan the bottom of the page (as in ID-2). Only one said that she wanted the APR and credit line information first \nbecause \"I have good credit and I want to know what I can get.\"\n\n. The comparison of the two payment plans was presented very differently in the two early disclosure forms. ID-1 \ndescribed the two plans in narrative form, while ID-2 included a table that compared various features of the two \nplans. When asked which format they found clearer, participants were mixed. Several said that they preferred the \n\n\n\ntabular format used in  ID-2 because it required less reading. At the same time, other participants commented that \nthey found the narrative format in ID-1 easier to understand. Most participants were in agreement, however, that \nthey liked the fact that ID-1 directly compared the plans in a section labeled \"Plan A vs. Plan B.\"\n\n. The Plan Comparison tables, which provided sample payments, were also organized differently on the two forms. \nAll participants indicated that they preferred the organization of the table in ID-2, in which all sample payments \nunder a given payment plan were grouped together.\n\n. The Plan Comparison table in ID-1 included a column labeled \"Total of All Payments,\" which was not provided on \nform ID-2. Participants strongly preferred that this column be included in the table, and several participants who saw \nID-1 used this information when choosing between the two payment plans.\n\nAccount-Opening Disclosure (AO-2)\n\nInitial Reactions\n\n. Participants were generally very comfortable with the account-openingdisclosure used in this round. This \nappeared to be in large part because it was so similar in format and content with the early disclosures that \nparticipants were shown first. Several participants even commented that the disclosure looked very similar to the \none that was shown to them previously.\n\nInformation about Payments\n\n. All participants understood that if their interest rate went up, their payment would also increase.\n\n. All participants understood that their minimum required payment would stay the same during the borrowing period, \nbut would increase at the beginning of the repayment period.\n\n. Unlike in previous rounds, almost all participants understood why the payment during the repayment period would \ndecrease over time. This increase in comprehension was due to the fact that AO-2 explained this decrease in the \ntext above the Sample Payments table.\n\n. Almost all participants were able to estimate what their minimum payments would be on a $ 40,000 balance from \nthe information on the form. About half multiplied the payments for $ 10,000 by four, while others divided the \npayments for $ 80,000 by two. Only one participant did not know how to estimate what payments would be on a $ \n40,000 balance.\n\nFees\n\n. Participants were asked which of the fees shown on the second page of the account-openingdisclosure they \nwould consider most important. Most indicated that they would be most interested in the breakdown of the account-\nopening fees, because these were the largest. Several participants also commented that they would want to \nunderstand these fees so that\n\n . When asked whether there were any additional types of fees that were not listed on the form that they would want \ndisclosed to them, participants did not identify any.\n\nHistorical Example Table\n\n. Most participants understood that the Historical Example Table showed how their rate could change over time. As \nin previous rounds, however, only about half understood that the information in the table was based on actual \nhistorical data.\n\n\n\n. When it was pointed out to them that the Historical Example Table provides historical information, a few \nparticipants commented that they felt it might be unreliable to make financial decisions based on what has \nhappened in the past. One specifically pointed to the instability in the current economy as an indicator that financial \nconditions can change quickly.\n\n. Participants were asked whether the Historical Example Table included any important information that was not in \nthe \"Historical Changes to Prime Rate\" section of the early and account-openingdisclosures. Most participants \nindicated that the \"Historical Changes to Prime Rate\" section covered the most important content from the Historical \nExample Table.\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. As in the previous round, participants reacted very positively to the Key Questions disclosure. Several participants \nindicated that it clarified some concepts that they had difficulty understanding from the other disclosure forms--\nparticularly the definition of \"balloon payment\" and the differences between borrowing and repayment periods.\n\n. Comprehension of the Key Questions document was very strong; participants were able to explain in their own \nwords all of the questions and answers. Participants indicated that they found the language used in this disclosure \nto be very clear and easy to read.\n\n. One participant suggested that Question 1 (\"Can my interest rate increase?\") and Question 2 (\"Can my minimum \nmonthly payment increase?\") could be combined. The same participant suggested defining the terms \"APR,\" \n\"index,\" \"margin,\" as was done for \"balloon payment\" in Question 4.\n\n. As in the previous round, one participant indicated that Question 5 (\"Do I have to pay any fees to have a line of \ncredit?\") was unnecessary, since most people would already know this information.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nTiming of Application/Early Disclosure\n\n. Findings from this round validated the Board staff's decision to develop and test an early transaction-specific \ndisclosure that would be given soon after application. Participants overwhelmingly indicated that they would prefer \nto be given a disclosure after application that provides more transaction-specific information, as opposed to a more \ngeneral application disclosure. As a result, all subsequent rounds focused on testing this type of early disclosure.\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n. Participants continued to be confused by the statement that, unlike APRs for closed-end loans, APRs for HELOCs \ndo not include fees. Therefore, this statement was not included in any subsequent forms.\n\nFees\n\n. Because participants in previous rounds consistently indicated that they would like a more detailed breakdown of \ntheir account-opening fees as early as possible in the process, some versions of the early disclosure tested in \nsubsequent rounds provided this breakdown.\n\nBorrowing and Repayment Periods\n\n\n\n. Because participants' understanding of both the distinction between the borrowing and repayment periods and the \ntiming of these periods was significantly better this round than in previous rounds, the Borrowing and Repayment \nTerms section was retained on all subsequent forms with only small changes in wording.\n\nPayment Plans/Plan Comparison\n\n. Because participants were split as to whether they liked the narrative (ID-1) or tabular (ID-2) comparison between \nthe two payment plans, both formats were tested again in the next round of interviews.\n\n. Participants indicated that they liked the \"Plan A vs. Plan B\" section of ID-1 that explicitly compared the two \npayment plans being offered. As a result, all subsequent early disclosures included a section that made this direct \ncomparison.\n\n. Because most participants preferred the format of the Plan Comparison table on ID-2 to that of ID-1, this format \nwas retained in forms for the next round.\n\n. In order to prevent \"information overload\" for consumers, rather than displaying the total of payments for each \npayment plan at each interest rate, early disclosures for the next round simply stated that \"with Loan A, you will pay \nless over time\" and \"with Loan B, you will pay more over time.\" The goal of this change was to allow participants to \ncontinue to use this term to compare plans without overwhelming them with numbers.\n\nInformation about Payments\n\n. Because of concerns about \"information overload\" for consumers, forms for the next round did not show how \npayments would change over time as the principal was paid off. Instead, these forms only showed the initial \npayment of the borrowing and repayment periods, which based on the assumptions used to calculate the payment \nexamples would have been the highest payment a consumer would make during those periods. One form simplified \nthe table even further, and provided only a single sample payment for each interest rate--the initial payment of the \nborrowing period.\n\n. Again because of concerns about \"information overload\" for consumers, information about balloon payments was \nremoved from the sample payment table. Instead, an explanatory note was added near the table indicating whether \nor not a balloon payment would be due.\n\nFixed-Rate Loan Option\n\n. Because some participants mistakenly thought that under the fixed-rate option they would be able to borrow $ \n40,000 in addition to their $ 80,000 credit line, the wording of this text was clarified in the next round.\n\nHistorical Example Table\n\n. Because many participants in all rounds of testing misunderstood the information in the Historical Example Table, \nand those who did understand it indicated that this information was not important to them, none of the forms for \nsubsequent rounds of testing included this table.\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. Although understanding of the difference between the borrowing and repayment periods was much stronger than \nin previous rounds, several participants who currently had HELOCs indicated they had never realized that this \ndistinction existed. For this reason, the decision was made to give this topic per more prominence on the Key \nQuestions disclosure by having separate questions address the borrowing and repayment periods (\"When can I \n\n\n\nborrow money?\" and \"How soon do I have to pay off my balance?\", respectively). The last question, which \naddressed the lender's right to lower the credit limit, was removed from the form.\n\nINTERVIEWS IN DENVER COLORADO (APRIL 4-15, 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nThe fourth round of 10 cognitive interviews was conducted in Denver, Colorado on April 14 and 15, 2009. The \nprimary focus of this round was to test consumer comprehension of two versions of the early disclosure. The \nprimary difference between these two forms was that one provided more detail about sample payments, and that \none contained several disclosures that are currently required by statute while the other did not.\n\nFour forms were tested in Denver, all of which are provided in Appendix C:\n\n. Two early disclosure forms (ID-3 & ID-4);\n\n. A revised account-opening form (AO-3); and\n\n. A revised version of the Key Questions disclosure.\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Interview participants were first asked to review one of the two early disclosure forms, and were asked a series of \nquestions designed to test their comprehension of the content. They were then shown the other version of the early \ndisclosure, and asked to compare the usefulness and clarity of several aspects of the two forms. Participants were \nshown these two forms in a rotating order, to minimize learning effects.\n\n. Next, participants were shown the account-opening form (AO-3). As in previous rounds, after reviewing this page \nthey were asked a series of questions designed to test comprehension.\n\n. Finally, as in the previous round participants were shown the Key Questions disclosure and asked to assess its \nusefulness and clarity.\n\nKey Interview Findings\n\nPrevious Experience with HELOCs\n\n. As in previous rounds, participants' comments during the opening discussion about their borrowing history \nshowed that a few did not understand the difference between HELOCs and home equity loans.\n\nEarly Disclosure Forms (ID-3 and ID-4)\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\nAll but one of the participants were able to identify the initial and maximum APRs without difficulty. All but one also \nunderstood that the rate would vary monthly. 8About half of participants understood the content of the Historical \n\n8 One of the participants in thisround had little understanding of HELOCs in general, and had difficulty answering most of the \ninterview questions.\n\n \n\n\n\nChanges to Prime Rate row; others were confused as to what this row meant. Some of those that did understand \nthe information indicated that they might use it to better estimate what their future interest rates could be. Others, \nhowever, said that they would be unlikely to use the information because they did not think that historical data could \nnecessarily be used to anticipate what would happen to the interest rate in the future.\n\nFees\n\n. All participants understood that they would be charged fees for opening a line or credit, and all but one identified \nthe amount of those fees without difficulty.\n\n. ID-3 included a reference that \"other fees may apply,\" while ID-4 did not. This reference appeared to be effective; \nthree of the five participants who saw ID-4 incorrectly assumed that no fees would be charged other than those on \nshown on the form, compared to only one participant who was shown ID-3. When shown both forms, most \nparticipants believed it was important to include the reference to other fees.\n\n. ID-3 provided a breakdown of account opening fees, while ID-4 simply indicated that an itemized list was available \nupon request. All participants said that preferred to have the breakdown shown on the form.\n\n. All participants except one understood that they could have their fees refunded if they decided within three days of \nreceiving the early disclosure not to open the line of credit. Forms ID-3 and ID-4 provided this information in two \ndifferent locations. Participants who saw ID-3, which displayed this information at the top of the first page, were able \nto find it slightly more easily.\n\n. Only a few participants realized that they could have their fees refunded even after three days, if they decided not \nto open an account because the terms (other than the APR) changed. Variations in the location of this information \nbetween the two early disclosure forms had no noticeable impact on understanding.\n\nBorrowing and Repayment Periods\n\n. All participants read and appeared to understand the description of the borrowing and repayment periods that was \nprovided on the forms. For example, all understood that they would only be able to borrow money during the \nborrowing period, and that they would have to make payments during both periods.\n\n. Most participants had difficulty translating what they had read about the borrowing and repayment periods to their \nreading of the Plan Comparison table. Several seemed to forget the distinction between the two periods, and as a \nresult were confused by the fact that the payment was different. One participant suggested showing the duration of \nthe two periods (i.e., Years 1 to 10, Years 11 to 20) in the headings of the columns in the Payment Plans and Plan \nComparison sections.\n\nPayment Plans/Plan Comparison\n\n. Everyone understood that the purpose of the Payment Plans section was to provide the borrower information \nabout different payment plan options.\n\n. As in the previous round, one of the forms (ID-3) compared the two payment plans in a tabular format, while the \nother (ID-4) provided narrative descriptions of the two plans. Again, participants' preferences between the two were \nmixed; about half felt that the tabular format was clearer and easier to read, while the other half preferred the \nnarrative descriptions.\n\n \n\n\n\n. Nine of the 10 participants said that they would choose Plan A over Plan B because it would allow them to avoid a \nballoon payment and they would pay less over time. All participants who saw ID-3 also understood that the time it \nwould take to pay off their balance would also be shorter under Plan A.\n\n. All participants understood that Plan B would allow them to make lower payments during the borrowing period. \nSeveral participants, however, did not realize that this was because these lower payments did not include any \nprincipal. This confusion was sometimes due to the fact that participants did not realize that the payment calculation \nformula could be different during the borrowing and repayment periods.\n\n. While ID-3 presented the first monthly payment for both the borrowing and repayment periods, ID-4 showed only \nthe first monthly payment for the whole term of the account (i.e., for the borrowing period.) This led to several \nsignificant misconceptions on the part of participants, some of whom assumed that if the interest rate did not \nchange, the payment would stay constant throughout the entire term. Others stated that they did not know how or if \nthe payment might change over time. Some realized from the Payment Plans section that the payment calculation \nmethod would change from the borrowing to the repayment period, and commented that the impact of this on the \npayment was not shown. One, for example, called this form \"incomplete\" because it showed \"only half of your \nprogram.\"\n\nBalloon Payment\n\n. Everyone had a basic understanding of the term \"balloon payment,\" and that, if they opted for Plan B, they might \nowe a balloon payment at the end of the loan term. In fact, most cited this as one of the reasons they would opt for \nPlan A.\n\n. Most participants understood that paying larger payments up front could help them avoid paying balloon \npayments. However, two participants were unsure whether they would be allowed to make larger payments if they \nchose Plan B.\n\n\"Risks\" Section\n\n. All but one of the participants understood that the bank had the right to terminate their line of credit.\n\nFixed-Rate Loan Option\n\n. All participants understood that they would have the option of borrowing a sum of money at a fixed rate. Unlike in \nthe previous round, participants generally understood that any money they borrowed at a fixed rate would apply \ntoward the credit limit for their line of credit.\n\nMinimum Loan\n\n. All participants understood that they would have to borrow $ 10,000 upon opening the account.\n\nAccount-Opening Disclosure (AO-3)\n\nInitial Reactions\n\n. As in the previous round, overall reaction to the account-opening form was very positive and comprehension was \ngenerally high. Again, it appeared that participants' understanding was helped by the fact that the account-opening \nform was so similar in format and content to the early disclosures they had read earlier.\n\n\n\nFees\n\n. All participants were able to identify the fee they would be charged for going over their credit limit.\n\n. As in the previous round, most participants indicated that information about the account-opening and penalty fees \nwas more important to them than information about transaction fees. The least important fee to most participants \nwas the foreign transaction fee; most indicated they did not believe this fee would ever apply to them.\n\n. When asked whether there were any additional types of fees that they would want disclosed that were not shown \non the form, all participants indicated that there were not.\n\nInformation about Payments\n\n. All participants understood that if the interest rate remained the same and no additional money was borrowed, the \nminimum monthly payment would stay the same during the borrowing period.\n\n. All but one participant understood that the payment would increase from the borrowing to the repayment periods; \nthe remaining participant assumed that his payment would remain constant throughout the term of the loan.\n\n. All participants understood that if their interest rate went up, their monthly payments would go up.\n\n. All participants were able to estimate what their payments would be if they were to borrow $ 40,000 rather than the \n$ 10,000 or $ 80,000 balances used in the examples. Most estimated by multiplying the payments for $ 10,000 by \nfour; three participants divided the payments for $ 80,000 by two.\n\nImportance of Disclosure Statements\n\n. Near the end of the interview, participants were directed to read several statements on the account-opening form. \nThey were then asked to indicate how important the statement was to them, and whether it was necessary to \ninclude on the form.\n\n. Eight of the 10 participants indicated that it was important that the form disclose that there is no limit to how much \ntheir rate could increase in a year.\n\n. Participants were divided about whether or not the form needed to state that the maximum rate could be reached \nas early as the first month. While some indicated this information was very important, others felt that the statement \nwas not necessary because it was extremely unlikely that the rate would actually increase that quickly.\n\n. About half of participants indicated that it was important that the form state that \"your monthly statement will tell \nyou each time your rate changes.\" Other participants did not feel this was important, because even in the absence \nof this statement they would assume that they would be notified of rate changes on their statement.\n\n. Only two participants thought it was important that the form state that the Prime Rate was published in the Wall \nStreet Journal. One thought it made the offer of credit \"more credible,\" while the other thought it was important to \nknow \"how the APR is derived.\"\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. As in previous rounds, participants were very positive about the Key Questions disclosure. Most commented that \nthe document would be very helpful, particularly for people with no prior experience with HELOCs.\n\n . Participants' comprehension of the information in the Key Questions document was very high; almost all were \nable to explain all of the questions and answers in their own words.\n\n\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nFees\n\n. Because most participants did not fully understand the circumstances under which they would be entitled to have \ntheir fees refunded, two alternative formats for providing this information on early disclosures were tested in the \nnext round.\n\nPayment Plans/Plan Comparison\n\n. The Duration of Line of Credit section continued to be effective in disclosing to participants the differences \nbetween the borrowing and repayment periods. Therefore, a parallel format was used in forms for the next round to \nillustrate the difference in how minimum payments would be calculated during each of the two periods.\n\n. Because of concerns that a $ 10,000 hypothetical balance could make sample payments misleadingly low, in the \nnext round sample payments on the account-openingdisclosure were based on a balance of $ 80,000--the credit \nline listed in the disclosure. On the early disclosures two different methods were used to calculate sample \npayments; these methods are explained in the next section.\n\n. Because some participants who saw ID-4 mistakenly thought that their payment would not change during the \nrepayment period, the decision was made that the Plan Comparison section should show the first payment for both \nthe borrowing and repayment periods.\n\n. Although participants responded positively to the \"Time to Pay Off Balance\" information provided for both payment \nplans, ICF Macro and Board staff were concerned that the length of repayment would not always be an accurate \nmeasure of which payment plan was better for consumers. Therefore, this information was not included in \nsubsequent forms.\n\nOther Statements on Form\n\n. Because participants indicated that the reference that the Prime Rate could be found in the Wall Street Journal \nwould not be useful to them, this disclosure was not included in any subsequent forms.\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. Because of concerns that some consumers in this and previous rounds did not fully understand the difference \nbetween a home equity loan and a HELOC until it was explained to them, a question about the differences between \nthese two products was added to the Key Questions document for the final round of testing. A new disclosure was \nalso developed that described these differences in more detail; this document was also tested in the next round.\n\nINTERVIEWS IN BETHESDA, MARYLAND (MAY 5-6, 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nThe fifth round of 10 cognitive interviews was conducted in Bethesda, Maryland on May 5 and 6, 2009. Because \nthis was the final round of testing before the Board was to release its proposed rules for HELOC disclosures, the \ngoals of this round were to validate previous design decisions that had been made and to gather data on design \nissues that were still under discussion. Participants in this round were also shown a new disclosure that described \nthe differences between home equity loans and HELOCs.\n\n\n\nFive forms were tested in Bethesda, all of which are provided in Appendix C:\n\n. Two early disclosure forms (ID-5 & ID-6);\n\n. A revised account-opening form (AO-4);\n\n. A revised version of the Key Questions disclosure; and\n\n. A new one-page early disclosure titled \"Home Equity Loan vs. Line of Credit.\" Like the Key Questions disclosure, \nthis form would be given to consumers with application.\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Interview participants were first asked to review one of the two early disclosure forms, and were asked a series of \nquestions, designed to test their comprehension of the content. They were then shown the other version of the \nearly disclosure, and asked to compare the usefulness and clarity of several aspects of the two forms. Participants \nwere shown these two forms in a rotating order, to minimize learning effects.\n\n. Next, participants were shown the account-opening form (AO-4). As in previous rounds, after reviewing this page \nthey were asked a series of questions designed to test comprehension.\n\n. Next, participants were shown the Key Questions disclosure and asked to assess its usefulness and clarity.\n\n. Finally, participants were shown the new disclosure comparing HELOCs to home equity loans. The goals of this \nportion of the interview were to assess participants' understanding of the information, and to evaluate whether this \ndisclosure provided any additional value to participants over the Key Questions document.\n\nKey Interview Findings\n\nEarly Disclosures (ID-5 and ID-6)\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n. All of the participants were able to easily identify the initial and maximum APRs for the line of credit.\n\n. All five participants who saw ID-5 understood that their rate could change monthly, and that their rate would be the \nPrime Rate plus 1%. ID-6 did not include either of these pieces of information; it only stated that the APR \"will vary \nwith the market based on the Prime Rate.\"\n\n. Participants strongly preferred the description of how their APR would be calculated used in ID-5 to that used in \nID-6. Several commented that ID-6 did not provide enough information, and one went so far as to call it \n\"misleading.\"\n\n. As in the previous round, about half of the participants who saw a form that included the Historical Changes to \nPrime Rate row understood the information it provided. 9 Participants who understood the information generally felt \nit would be useful to them in estimating what their future interest rate might be--although as in the previous round, \nthey cautioned that there was no guarantee that the Prime Rate would behave in the future as it had in the \npast.Fees\n\n9 ID-5 included this row, while ID-6 did not.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. All but one of the participants correctly identified the amount of fees that they would have to pay to take out a line \nof credit.\n\n. ID-5 provided a breakdown of account-opening fees, while ID-6 did not. When shown both forms, all participants \nindicated that they preferred to have the breakdown shown on the form--although none of the participants who saw \nID-6 first specifically asked for this information until they were shown ID-5.\n\n. ID-5 included a reference that \"other fees may apply,\" while ID-6 did not. As in the previous round, this reference \nappeared to be effective; all five participants who saw ID-6 incorrectly assumed that no fees would be charged \nother than those on shown on the form. All participants who were shown ID-5 understood that other fees could be \ncharged.\n\n. ID-5 displayed information about the refundability of fees at the top of the first page, while ID-6 showed it in the \nFees section, under the heading \"Refundability of Fees.\" There was some evidence that the latter placement was \nmore effective; three of five participants who saw ID-6 first were able to locate this information, compared to none of \nthose who saw ID-5 first.\n\nBorrowing and Payoff Periods\n\n. All but one of the participants understood the timing of the borrowing and repayment periods. They also \nunderstood that they could only borrow money during the borrowing period, and that payments would be due during \nboth periods.\n\nPayment Plans/Plan Comparison\n\n. All participants were able to explain the relative advantages of both Plans A and B--that is, that Plan B offered \nlower monthly payments during the borrowing period and Plan A offered no balloon payment and a lower total cost.\n\n. All participants said that they would choose Plan A over Plan B; as in previous rounds, this decision was based on \nthe fact that no balloon payment would be due under Plan A, and that this plan costs less over the entire term of the \nloan.\n\n. Despite the fact that the early disclosures stated that other plans might be available in addition to the two being \ndescribed on the form, seven of the 10 participants incorrectly assumed that no other plans were available.\n\n. Sample payments that were shown in the Plan Comparison section were calculated differently on ID-5 and ID-6. \nID-6 payments were based on a balance of $ 80,000 (the amount of the credit line being offered), borrowed when \nthe account was opened. Payments on ID-5, on the other hand, were based on an assumption that $ 10,000 was \nborrowed when the account was opened, and an additional $ 10,000 was borrowed on the last day of the borrowing \nperiod. However, only one of the participants who saw ID-5 understood the scenario on which these payments were \nbased--even after extensive prompting by the interviewer.\n\n. When participants were shown both forms and this difference in payment calculation was explained, all \nparticipants indicated that they preferred the approach used in ID-6. Several felt that the assumptions made in ID-5 \nwere too complex, and others liked the fact that ID-6 showed the \"worst case scenario\" of borrowing the entire \ncredit limit.\n\n. One participant in this round suggested using the heading \"An Example of Payments\" rather than \"Sample \nPayments\" in the Plan Comparison section, to clarify that the numbers provided do not represent actual payment \namounts and are provided only as an estimate.\n\nBalloon Payment\n\n. Seven of the 10 participants were able to define what a balloon payment was; the other three indicated that they \nwould want to avoid a balloon payment but were unsure what it was.\n\n\n\n\"Risks\" Section\n\n. Almost all participants understood that they would lose their home if they did not make the required monthly \npayments.\n\n . Seven of the 10 participants understood from the form that the bank could end their line of credit early.\n\n. Most participants indicated that they preferred to have the Risks section displayed at the top of the first page, \nbecause of the importance of the information. A few preferred to have the Risks section at the bottom of the page \nbecause they were more interested in the specific terms of their line of credit.\n\nMinimum Loan\n\n. As in the previous round, all participants understood that they would have to borrow $ 10,000 upon opening the \naccount.\n\nAccount Opening Disclosure (AO-4)\n\nInformation about Payments\n\n. All participants understood that if the interest rate remained the same and no additional money was borrowed, the \nminimum monthly payment would stay the same during the borrowing period.\n\n. All but one participant understood that the payment would increase from the borrowing to the repayment periods; \nthe remaining participant assumed that his payment would remain constant throughout the term of the loan.\n\n. All participants understood that if their interest rate went up, their monthly payments would go up.\n\n. While a few participants had difficulty, most were able to estimate what their minimum payment would be if they \nborrowed $ 40,000 instead of the $ 80,000 shown in the table.\n\nFees\n\n. Unlike in the previous round, a few participants were unable to identify the fee that they would be charged for \ngoing over their credit limit. Most, however, were able to find this fee easily.\n\n. As in previous rounds, participants indicated that of the fees listed on the form, they would be most interested in \ndetailed information about the account-opening fees.\n\nImportance of Disclosure Statements\n\n. As in the previous round, participants were again directed to read several statements on the account-opening \nform. As before, they were asked to indicate how important the statement was to them, and whether it was \nnecessary to include on the form.\n\n. Almost all participants in this round indicated that the statement \"Your monthly statement will show your rate \nchanges\" could be removed from the form. Participants generally felt that  this was not important information, and \nwould not affect their decision-making or behavior in any way.\n\n. About half of the participants felt that it was important to include the statement, \"There is no limit on how much the \nrate can change in one year.\"\n\n\n\n. Most participants indicated that it was unnecessary to state that the maximum rate could be reached in the first \nmonth; while this was theoretically true, they felt it was so unlikely that this statement was not useful.\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. As in previous rounds, the Key Questions disclosure was received very favorably by all participants. Several \ncommented that it was easy to read, and that it asked and answered important questions about HELOCs.\n\n. Participants in this round were asked to focus specifically on a new seventh Key Question that had been added: \n\"Should I get a home equity loan instead of a line of credit?\" This section of the disclosure described the relative \nadvantages and disadvantages of the two products. All participants indicated that the wording of this section was \nclear, and after reading it most were able to describe in their own words the differences between the two products.\n\n. One participant who had been planning to get a HELOC said that after reading this form he thought a home equity \nloan might be more appropriate for him. Two others commented that they wished they had received information \nabout home equity loans before taking out their HELOCs.\n\nHome Equity Loan vs. Line of Credit Disclosure\n\n. Participants responded positively to this form, and said that it contained useful information. There were no \ncomprehension issues with the document; participants seemed to understand all of the content.\n\n. Participants were asked to compare this disclosure form to the seventh Key Question, which also provided a \ncomparison of these two products. All of the participants indicated that the content of the two was very similar; none \nidentified any important information that appeared on the new disclosure but not in the Key Questions.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nInformation about Interest Rates\n\n. Because participants felt strongly that it was important for them to know exactly how their APR was determined, \nthe final form requires disclosure of the margin that will be used, as well as how frequently the rate could change.\n\n . Because participants who were knowledgeable about financial issues said that the Historical Example paragraph \ngave them valuable information about how much the Prime Rate was likely to fluctuate, the decision was made to \ninclude this information on both the early and account-openingdisclosures.\n\nFees\n\n. Because participants in several rounds of interviews indicated that an itemized breakdown of account-opening \nfees would be useful to have as early in the process as possible, the decision was made to include such a \nbreakdown on both the early and account-openingdisclosures.\n\n. Following this round, the decision was made to include a statement of the early disclosure that other fees could \nalso be charged in addition to those shown on the form. This disclosure will be required because in its absence, a \nlarge percentage of participants incorrectly assumed that no other fees would be charged.\n\n. Because participants in this round were more likely to notice and understand information about the refundability of \nfees when it was provided in the \"Fees\" section of the early disclosure, this location was retained in the final model \nform. In order to ensure that participants are aware that fees paid may be refundable in some cases, another \nreference to this information was also added at the end of the form.\n\n\n\nPayment Plans/Plan Comparison\n\n. Because participants in this round had a strong understanding of the two payment plans, the format in which these \nplans were described was retained in the final model early disclosure form.\n\n. Participants strongly preferred to be shown payment examples based on a loan equal to their credit limit (as in ID-\n6), rather than payments based on a more complex set of assumptions (as in ID-5). Therefore, this method of \ncalculating sample payments was used in the model early disclosure form.\n\n\"Risks\" Section\n\n. As noted above, participants were divided as to whether the Risks section should be at the top or the bottom of the \nform. Regardless of the placement of the section, most participants noticed and understood the disclosures about \nthe risk of loss of the home in case of default and the disclosure about a creditor's right to terminate the plan in \ncertain circumstances. In the Board staffs outreach, neither industry nor consumer group representatives indicated \na preference for either placement. Consumer group representatives did, however, emphasize the importance of \nhighlighting key terms such as the APR. Therefore, the model early disclosure forms and account-opening form \nplace the Risks section at the bottom of the form.\n\nOther Statements on Form\n\n. Because a large portion of participants in the last two rounds indicated that they did not provide important \ninformation, the decision was made to remove from the final model form references to the fact that rate changes will \nbe shown on the monthly statement and that the maximum APR could be reached as early as the first month. \nHowever, because several participants indicated that they found the statement \"There is no limit on how much the \nrate can change in one year\" to be important, this information was retained on the model form.\n\nKey Questions Disclosure\n\n. Because the new question comparing HELOCs to home equity loans was considered so important by participants \nin this round, it was retained in the final disclosure.\n\n. Because participants indicated that the new one-page disclosure about HELOCs and home equity loans was \nlargely redundant with the Key Questions disclosure, the decision was made not to require that the stand-alone \nform be provided to consumers.\n\nCHAPTER IV: SUMMARY\n\nThis report summarizes work conducted by ICF Macro from December 2008 through June 2009 in support of the \nBoard's efforts to revise Regulation Z rules pertaining to disclosures for home equity lines of credit. The outcomes \nof this work include the development of:\n\n. A new \"early\" disclosure, that provides transaction-specific information no more than three business days after an \napplication for a home equity line of credit is submitted. This disclosure describes:\n\n. A description of potential risks, including possible termination or suspension of the line of credit by the lender;\n\n. How the interest rate for the line of credit will be determined;\n\n\n\n. The total amount of account-opening fees that will be charged, as well as a summary breakdown of those \nfees, and certain other fees such as the annual fee;\n\n. The credit limit;\n\n. Minimum transaction and minimum balance requirements;\n\n. The distinction between the borrowing and repayment periods for the line of credit, as well as the timing of \nboth of the periods;\n\n. Two payment plans available to borrowers, along with sample payments for each; and\n\n. Information about the timing and size of any balloon payments that might be owed.\n. A revised account-openingdisclosure that mirrors the content and tabular format of the early disclosure and \nprovides additional detail about penalty and transaction fees; and\n\n. A new document titled \"Key Questions to Ask About Home Equity Lines of Credit,\" a concise and easy-to read \ndisclosure for potential borrowers that provides guidance on what questions they should ask their lenders.\n\nThe results of the interviews described in this report will inform the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z, \nwhich are scheduled for release in July 2009. The disclosure forms developed through iterative testing will be \nreleased with the proposal as model forms. By relying heavily on direct consumertesting in the development of \nthese forms, the Board hopes to ensure that its new regulations will lead to financial disclosures that will be easy for \nconsumers to read and understand, and as a result will help them make well-informed financial decisions.\n\nAPPENDIX A: Sample Recruitment Protocol\n\nParticipant Screener for Federal Reserve Board In-Depth Interviews Bethesda, MD\n\nMay 5th and 6th, 2009\n\nGeneral Information and Recruiting Specifications\n.

Current Application Disclosure\n\n. New Account-Opening Disclosure\n\n. Payment Example Form\n\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE APPLYING FOR A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT (HELOC)\n\nHome Equity Line of Credit Program Disclosure\n\nThis disclosure contains important information about our Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Please read it \ncarefully and keep a copy for your records.\n\nAvailability of Terms\n\nAll of the terms described below are subject to change. If these terms change (other than the annual percentage \nrate) and you decide, as a result, not to enter into an agreement with us, you are entitled to a refund of any fees that \nyou paid to us or anyone else in connection with your application.\n\nSecurity Interest\n\nABC Bank will take a mortgage on your home, so you could lose your home if you do not meet the obligations in \nyour agreement with us.\n\nPossible Actions\n\nUnder certain circumstances, ABC Bank can terminate your line, require you to pay the outstanding balance in one \npayment, and charge you fees upon termination; refuse to make additional extensions of credit; reduce the credit \nlimit; and, as specified in the credit agreement, make certain changes in the plan. If you ask, we will give you \nspecific information concerning when we can take these actions.\n\nRequesting an Advance\n\nYou may request an advance by writing HELOC checks that ABC Bank has given to you for this purpose, by \ntransferring funds via telephone or internet, or authorizing ABC Bank to move funds into your transaction account. \nThe minimum advance amount is $ 250.\n\nMinimum Payment Requirements\n\n\n\nYou can obtain credit advances for 10 years (the \"draw period\"). At the end of 10 years, you may have the option to \nrenew the \"draw period,\" subject to our consent. During the draw period, payments will be due monthly. Your \nminimum monthly payment will equal the amount of earned fees and charges and the amount of accrued interest on \nthe last day of the billing cycle. The minimum monthly payments during the draw period will not reduce the principal \nthat is outstanding on your line. After the draw period ends, you will no longer be able to obtain credit advances \nand must pay the outstanding balance on your account (the \"repayment period\").\n\nThe length of the repayment period is 10 years. During the repayment period, payments will be due monthly. Your \nminimum monthly payment will equal the amount of earned fees and charges, the amount of accrued interest on the \nlast day of the billing cycle plus 1.500% of the loan account balance, which is principal plus accrued interest. There \nis no minimum finance charge. The minimum monthly payments may not be sufficient to fully repay the principal on \nyour line by the end of the draw and repayment periods. If they are not, you will then be required to pay the entire \nbalance in a single payment at maturity.\n\nMinimum Payment Example\n\nIf you made only the minimum monthly payment and took no other credit advances, it would take 20 year(s) to pay \noff a credit advance of $ 10,000 at an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 8.5%. During that period, you would make \n120 payment(s) of $ 70.83 followed by 120 payment(s) varying between $ 221.90 and $ 36.82, with a final payment \nof $ 1609.63.\n\nFees and Charges\n\nYou must pay certain fees to third parties to open the plan. These fees generally total between $ 0.00 and $ \n1,000.00. If you ask, we will give you an itemization of the fees you will have to pay to third parties. There is no \nannual fee for the first year of the program, provided your account remains open through the first year. If you close \nyour account within the first year, there will be an early termination fee of $ 250. There is an annual $ 50 fee in \nsubsequent years.\n\nTax Deductibility\n\nYou should consult a tax advisor regarding the deductibility of interest and charges for the plan.\n\nVariable Rate Features\n\nThis plan has a variable rate feature and the annual percentage rate (corresponding to the periodic rate) and the \nminimum monthly payment can change as a result. The annual percentage rate includes only interest and not other \ncosts. The annual percentage rate is based on the value of an index. The index is The Wall Street Journal Prime \nRate as published in The Wall Street Journal. To determine the annual percentage rate that will apply to your \naccount, ABC Bank adds a margin to the value of the index. The initial annual percentage rate may be determined \nby ABC Bank and may not necessarily be based on the index and margin used to make later rate adjustments. This \ndiscounted initial rate will be in effect for the first year your plan is open. Ask us for the current index value, margin, \ndiscount, and annual percentage rate.\n\n\n\nRate Changes\n\nThe annual percentage rate can change daily. There is no limit on the amount by which the rate can change in a \none-year period. The maximum annual percentage rate that can apply during the plan is 24.990%, or the maximum \nannual percentage rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is less. Rate change information will be included in \nyour monthly statement.\n\nMaximum Rate and Payment Examples\n\nIf you had an outstanding balance of $ 10,000 at the beginning of the draw period, the minimum monthly payment \nat the maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 24.990% would be $ 208.25. The maximum annual percentage \nrate during the draw period could be reached in the first month. If you had an outstanding balance of $ 10,000 at \nthe beginning of the repayment period, the minimum monthly payment at the maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE \nRATE of 24.990% would be $ 361.37. The maximum annual percentage rate during the repayment period could be \nreached in the first month.\n\nHistorical Example\n\nThe following table shows how the annual percentage rate and the minimum payments for a single $ 10,000 credit \nadvance would have changed based on changes in the index over the last 15 years.

If you make only the minimum payments during this period, you will not pay off any of your loan principal. \nYour draw period lasts 10 years.\n\n\n\nPayments During Repayment Period\n\nDuring the repayment period, your minimum monthly payments cover the greater of 1 % of the outstanding \nbalance, or the interest you owe on the outstanding balance. The repayment period starts at the end of the draw \nperiod and lasts 20 years.\n\nBalloon Payment\n\nIf you make only the minimum payments, you may not pay off all, or possibly any, of the amount you actually \nborrowed by the end of the loan term and may have to pay the outstanding balance in a single large payment. This \nis known as a balloon payment. You should ask your lender under what circumstances you may owe a \nballoon payment.\n\nThe tables below show examples of the minimum monthly and balloon payments you would have to make given \ndifferent balances and different Annual Percentage Rates.\n\nSample Payments If You Borrowed $ 10,000\n\nCurrent APR Maximum APR\n\n6.00% 24.99%\nDraw Period Minimum Payment\n\n120 payments $ 50.00 $ 208.25\nRepayment Period Minimum Payment $ 100.00 to $ 30.48 $ 208.25\n239 payments\n\nBalloon Payment Final payment due $ 3,048.32 $ 10,208.25\n1 payment\n\nSample Payments If You Borrowed $ 80,000\n\nCurrent APR Maximum APR\n\n6.00% 24.99%\nDraw Period Minimum Payment $ 400.00 $ 1,666.00\n120 payments\n\nRepayment Period Minimum Payment $ 800.00 to $ 243.84 $ 1,666.00\n239 payments\n\nBalloon Payment Final payment due $ 24,386.56 $ 81,666.00\n1 payment\n\nRound 2: Los Angeles, CA February 11-12, 2009\n\n.

Key Questions Disclosure\n\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE APPLYING FOR A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT (HELOC)\n\nHome Equity Line of Credit Program Disclosure\n\nThis disclosure contains important information about our Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Please read it \ncarefully and keep a copy for your records.\n\nAvailability of Terms\n\nAll of the terms described below are subject to change. If these terms change (other than the annual percentage \nrate) and you decide, as a result, not to enter into an agreement with us, you are entitled to a refund of any fees that \nyou paid to us or anyone else in connection with your application.\n\nSecurity Interest\n\nABC Bank will take a mortgage on your home, so you could lose your home if you do not meet the obligations in \nyour agreement with us.\n\nPossible Actions\n\nUnder certain circumstances, ABC Bank can terminate your line, require you to pay the outstanding balance in one \npayment, and charge you fees upon termination; refuse to make additional extensions of credit; reduce the credit \nlimit; and, as specified in the credit agreement, make certain changes in the plan. If you ask, we will give you \nspecific information concerning when we can take these actions.\n\nRequesting an Advance\n\nYou may request an advance by writing HELOC checks that ABC Bank has given to you for this purpose, by \ntransferring funds via telephone or internet, or authorizing ABC Bank to move funds into your transaction account. \nThe minimum advance amount is $ 250.\n\nMinimum Payment Requirements\n\nYou can obtain credit advances for 10 years (the \"borrowing period\"). At the end of 10 years, you may have the \noption to renew the \"borrowing period,\" subject to our consent. During the borrowing period, payments will be due \nmonthly. Your minimum monthly payment will equal the amount of earned fees and charges and the amount of \naccrued interest on the last day of the billing cycle. The minimum monthly payments during the borrowing period will \nnot reduce the principal that is outstanding on your line. After the borrowing period ends, you will no longer be able \nto obtain credit advances and must pay the outstanding balance on your account (the \"payoff period\").\n\nThe length of the payoff period is 10 years. During the payoff period, payments will be due monthly. Your minimum \nmonthly payment will equal the amount of earned fees and charges, the amount of accrued interest on the last day \nof the billing cycle plus 1.500% of the loan account balance. There is no minimum finance charge. The minimum \nmonthly payments may not be sufficient to fully repay the principal on your line by the end of the borrowing and \npayoff periods. If they are not, you will then be required to pay the entire balance in a single payment at maturity.\n\n\n\nMinimum Payment Example\nIf you made only the minimum monthly payment and took no other credit advances, it would take 20 year(s) to pay \noff a credit advance of $ 10,000 at an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 8.5%. During that period, you would make \n120 payment(s) of $ 70.83 followed by 120 payment(s) varying between $ 221.90 and $ 36.82, with a final payment \nof $ 1,609.63.\n\nFees and Charges\n\nYou must pay certain fees to third parties to open the plan. These fees generally total between $ 0.00 and $ \n1,000.00. If you ask, we will give you an itemization of the fees you will have to pay to third parties. There is no \nannual fee for the first year of the program, provided your account remains open through the first year. If you close \nyour account within the first year, there will be an early termination fee of $ 250. There is an annual $ 60 fee in \nsubsequent years.\n\nTax Deductibility\n\nIf you borrow more than your home is worth, the interest on the excess amount is not deductible for federal income \ntax purposes. You should consult a tax advisor regarding the deductibility of interest and charges for the plan.\n\nVariable Rate Features\n\nThis plan has a variable rate feature and the annual percentage rate (corresponding to the periodic rate) and the \nminimum monthly payment can change as a result. The annual percentage rate includes only interest and not other \ncosts. The annual percentage rate is based on the value of an index. The index is The Wall Street Journal Prime \nRate as published in The Wall Street Journal. To determine the annual percentage rate that will apply to your \naccount, ABC Bank adds a margin to the value of the index. The initial annual percentage rate may be determined \nby ABC Bank and may not necessarily be based on the index and margin used to make later rate adjustments. This \ndiscounted initial rate will be in effect for the first year your plan is open. Ask us for the current index value, margin, \ndiscount, and annual percentage rate.\n\nRate Changes\n\nThe annual percentage rate can change monthly. There is no limit on the amount by which the rate can change in a \none-year period. The maximum annual percentage rate that can apply during the plan is 24.990%, or the maximum \nannual percentage rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is less. Rate change information will be included in \nyour monthly statement.\n\nMaximum Rate and Payment Examples\nIf you had an outstanding balance of $ 10,000 at the beginning of the borrowing period, the minimum monthly \npayment at the maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 24.990% would be $ 208.25. The maximum annual \npercentage rate during the borrowing period could be reached in the first month. If you had an outstanding balance \nof $ 10,000 at the beginning of the payoff period, the minimum monthly payment at the maximum ANNUAL \nPERCENTAGE RATE of 24.990% would be $ 361.37. The maximum annual percentage rate during the payoff \nperiod could be reached in the first month.\n\nHistorical Example\n\n\n\nThe following table shows how the annual percentage rate and the minimum payments for a single $ 10,000 credit \nadvance would have changed based on changes in the index over the last 15 years. The index values are from the \nfirst business day of January. While only one payment amount per year is shown, payments would have varied \nduring each year. The table assumes that no additional credit advances were taken, that only the minimum \npayment was made, and that the rate remained constant during each year. It does not necessarily indicate how the \nindex or your payments would change in the future.\n\nHistorical Example Assuming a $ 10,000 Balance\n\nAnnual Percentage Minimum Monthly\n\nIndex Margin Rate (APR) Payment\n1991 10.000% 0.000% 10.000% $ 83.33\n1992 6.500% 0.000% 6.500% $ 54.17\n1993 6.000% 0.000% 6.000% $ 50.00\n1994 6.000% 0.000% 6.000% $ 50.00\n1995 8.500% 0.000% 8.500% $ 70.83\n1996 8.500% 0.000% 8.500% $ 70.83\n1997 8.250% 0.000% 8.250% $ 68.75\n1998 8.500% 0.000% 8.500% $ 70.83\n1999 7.750% 0.000% 7.750% $ 64.58\n2000 8.500% 0.000% 8.500% $ 70.83\n2001 9.000% 0.000% 9.000% $ 226.13\n2002 4.750% 0.000% 4.750% $ 158.42\n2003 4.250% 0.000% 4.250% $ 129.11\n2004 5.250% 0.000% 5.250% $ 112.52\n2005 5.250% 0.000% 5.250% $ 93.72\n\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE APPLYING FOR A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT (HELOC)\n\nThis disclosure contains important information about our Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC).

Lines \nof credit have risky features that could make it difficult for you to repay your balance. As a result, you could lose \nyour home. If you are not comfortable with the risks associated with a line of credit, ask your lender about other \nloan products, such as a traditional home equity loan. For more information, go to federalreserve.gov/shopwisely.\n\nFor a list of counselors in your area, go to www.HELP.gov.\nCan my interest rate increase?\n\n1 Lines of credit usually have an adjustable\ninterest rate, which means that the rate can increase or\n\ndecrease each month. Some lenders offer a\n\ndiscounted interest rate that is fixed for an\n\nintroductory period. However, after this introductory\n\nperiod the rate will usually increase.\n\nCan my minimum monthly payment increase?\n\n2\nYes, your minimum monthly payment can increase.\nThis increase can be based on a number\n\nof factors, such as when your adjustable\ninterest rate increases or you borrow more money.\n\nWhat is the difference between the\n\n\"borrowing\" and \"payoff\" periods?\n\n3\nThe borrowing period starts when you open your\nline of credit and lasts for a limited time.\n\nDuring the borrowing period, you can take out\n\nloans from your line of credit, and you may be\nrequired to make a minimum monthly payment.\n\nAfter the borrowing period ends, the payoff\n\nperiod begins. During the payoff period,\n\nyou cannot borrow any more money from your line of\ncredit, and you must make larger minimum\n\npayments than during the withdrawal period.\n\nWill I owe a balloon payment?\n\n4 If you make only the minimum payments each month,\n\nyou may not pay off your entire balance\nby the end of the loan term. At that point,\n\n\n\nyou may be asked to pay the entire remaining balance\nas a single lump sum, or \"balloon payment.\"\n\nIf you cannot refinance the outstanding balance or\n\npay it off using your savings, you could lose your home.\n\nDo I have to pay any fees to have a line of credit?\n\n5\nYou may have to pay fees to open your line of credit.\nYou may also be charged an annual fee. In\n\naddition, you may have to pay penalty fees for\n\nlate or missed payments or if you do not carry a\n\nrequired minimum balance. You may also be charged\n\nan early termination fee if you decide to\n\npay off or refinance your balance early.\n\nOnce I open a line of credit, can my\n\nlender change the amount of money\n\nthat I can borrow?\n\n6\nIf the value of your home declines or if your\n\nfinancial situation changes, your lender can lower\n\nyour credit limit or prevent you from borrowing\nany more money. Keep this in mind as you make\n\nfinancial plans for the future.\n\nRound 3:\n\nChicago, IL\n\nMarch 24-25, 2009\n\n. Early Disclosure (ID-1)\n\n. Early Disclosure (ID-2)\n\n.

Lines of credit have \nrisky features that could make it difficult for you to repay your balance. As a result, you could lose your home. Ask \nyour lender about availability and terms of other loan products, such as a traditional home equity loan. For more \ninformation, go to federalreserve.gov/shopwisely. For a list of counselors in your area, go to www.HELP.gov.\n\n1 Can my interest rate increase?\n\nLines of credit usually have a variable interest rate, which means that the rate can increase or decrease from time \nto time. A lender may offer you a discounted interest rate that is fixed for an introductory period. However, after this \nintroductory period the rate will usually increase.\n\n2 Can my minimum monthly payment increase?\n\nYes, your minimum monthly payment can increase based on a number of factors, such as if your adjustable \ninterest rate increases or you borrow more money.\n\n3 What is the difference between \"borrowing\" and \"repayment\" periods?\n\nThe borrowing period starts when you open your line of credit and lasts for a limited time. During the borrowing \nperiod, you can borrow money and may be required to make a minimum monthly payment. After the borrowing \nperiod ends, the repayment period begins. During the repayment period, you cannot borrow any more money and \nyou must make larger minimum payments than during the withdrawal period.\n\n4 Will I owe a balloon payment?\n\nIf you make only the minimum monthly payments you may not pay off your entire balance by the end of the loan \nterm. At that point, you may have to pay the remaining balance as a single lump sum, known as a \"balloon \npayment.\" If you cannot refinance the outstanding balance or pay it off using your savings, you could lose your \nhome.\n\n5 Do I have to pay any fees to have a line of credit?\n\n\n\nYou may have to pay fees to open your line of credit. You may also be charged an annual or maintenance fee. In \naddition, you may have to pay penalty fees for late or missed payments or if you carry less than the required \nminimum balance. You may also be charged an early termination fee if you decide to pay off or refinance your \nbalance early.\n\n6 Once I open a line of credit, can my lender change the amount of money that I can borrow?\n\nIf the value of your home declines or if your financial situation changes, your lender can lower your credit limit or \nprevent you from borrowing more money. Keep this in mind as you make financial plans for the future.\n\nRound 4: Denver, CO\n\nApril 14-1 5, 2009\n\n. Early Disclosure (ID-3)\n\n. Early Disclosure (ID-4)\n\n.

This \nproposal would revise the rules for disclosures of closed-end credit secured by real property or a consumer's \ndwelling, except for rules regarding rescission and reverse mortgages, which the Board anticipates will be reviewed \nat a later date. Published elsewhere in today's Federal Register is the Board's proposal regarding rules for \ndisclosures of open-end credit secured by a consumer's dwelling.\n\nDisclosures provided at application would include a Board-published one-page \"Key Questions to Ask About Your \nMortgage\" document that explains potentially risky loan features, and a Board-published one-page \"Fixed vs. \nAdjustable Rate Mortgages\" document. Transaction-specific disclosures required within three business days of \napplication would summarize key loan terms. The calculation of the annual percentage rate and the finance charge \nwould be revised to be more comprehensive, and their disclosures improved. Consumers would receive a \"final\" \nTILA disclosure at least three business days before consummation. Certain new post-consummation disclosures \nwould be required. In addition, the proposed revisions would prohibit certain payments to mortgage brokers and \nloan officers that are based on the loan's terms or conditions, and prohibit steering consumers to transactions that \nare not in their interest to increase compensation received.\n\n\n\nRules regarding eligibility restrictions and disclosures for credit insurance and debt cancellation or debt suspension \ncoverage would apply to all closed-end and open-end credit transactions.\n\nDATES: Comments must be received on or before December 24, 2009.\n\nADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by Docket No. R-1366, by any of the following methods:\n\n.

Background on TILA and Regulation Z\n\nCongress enacted the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) based on findings that economic stability would be enhanced and \ncompetition among consumer credit providers would be strengthened by the informed use of credit resulting from \nconsumers' awareness of the cost of credit. One of the purposes of TILA is to provide meaningful disclosure of \ncredit terms to enable consumers to compare credit terms available in the marketplace more readily and avoid the \nuninformed use of credit.\n\nTILA's disclosures differ depending on whether credit is an open-end (revolving) plan or a closed-end (installment) \nloan. TILA also contains procedural and substantive protections for consumers. TILA is implemented by the Board's \nRegulation Z. An Official Staff Commentary interprets the requirements of Regulation Z. By statute, creditors that \nfollow in good faith Board or official staff interpretations are insulated from civil liability, criminal penalties, or \nadministrative sanction.\n\nII. Summary of Major Proposed Changes\n\n\n\nThe goal of the proposed amendments to Regulation Z is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures that creditors \nprovide to consumers in connection with an application and throughout the life of a mortgage. The proposed \nchanges are the result of the Board's review of the provisions that apply to closed-end mortgage transactions. The \nproposal would apply to all closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, and would not be \nlimited to credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. The Board is proposing changes to the format, timing, \nand content of disclosures for the four main types of closed-end credit information governed by Regulation Z: (1) \ndisclosures at application; (2) disclosures within three days after application; (3) disclosures three days before \nconsummation; and (4) disclosures after consummation. In addition, the Board is proposing additional protections \nrelated to limits on loan originator compensation.\n\nDisclosures at Application. The proposal contains new requirements and changes to the format and content of \ndisclosures given at application, to make them more meaningful and easier for consumers to use. The proposed \nchanges include:\n\n. Providing a new one-page Board publication, entitled \"Key Questions to Ask About Your Mortgage,\" which would \nexplain the potentially risky features of a loan.\n\n. Providing a new one-page Board publication, entitled \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages,\" which would explain \nthe basic differences between such loans and would replace the lengthy Consumer Handbook on Adjustable-Rate \nMortgages (CHARM booklet) currently required under Regulation Z.\n\n. Revising the format and content of the current adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loan program disclosure, including: \na requirement that the disclosure be in a tabular question and answer format, a streamlined plain-language \ndisclosure of interest rate and payment information, and a new disclosure of potentially risky features, such as \nprepayment penalties.\n\nDisclosures within Three Days after Application. The proposal also contains revisions to the TILA disclosures \nprovided within three days after application (the \"early TILA disclosure\") to make the information clearer and more \nconspicuous. The proposed changes include:\n\n. Revising the calculation of the finance charge and annual percentage rate (APR) so that they capture most fees \nand costs paid by consumers in connection with the credit transaction.\n\n. Providing a graph that would show consumers how their APR compares to the APRs for borrowers with excellent \ncredit and for borrowers with impaired credit.\n\n. Summarizing key loan features, such as the loan term, amount, and type, and disclosing total settlement charges, \nas is currently required for the good faith estimate of settlement costs (GFE) under the Real Estate Settlement \nProcedures Act (RESPA) and Regulation X.\n\n. Requiring disclosure of potential changes to the interest rate and monthly payment.\n\n. Adopting new format requirements, including rules regarding: type size and use of boldface for certain terms, \nplacement of information, and highlighting certain information in a tabular format.\n\nDisclosures Three Days before Consummation. The proposal would require creditors to provide a \"final\" TILA \ndisclosure that the consumer must receive at least three business days before consummation. In addition, two \nproposed alternatives regarding redisclosure of the \"final\" TILA disclosure include:\n\n. Alternative 1: If any terms change after the \"final\" TILA disclosures are provided, then another final TILA disclosure \nwould need to be provided so that the consumer receives it at least three business days before consummation.\n\n. Alternative 2: If the APR exceeds a certain tolerance or an adjustable-rate feature is added after the \"final\" TILA \ndisclosures are provided, then another final TILA disclosure would need to be provided so that the consumer \n\n\n\nreceives it at least three business days before consummation. All other changes could be disclosed at \nconsummation.\n\nDisclosures after Consummation. The proposal would change the timing, content and types of notices provided \nafter consummation. The proposed changes include:\n\n. For ARMs, increasing advance notice of a payment change from 25 to 60 days, and revising the format and \ncontent of the ARM adjustment notice.\n\n. For payment option loans with negative amortization, requiring a monthly statement to provide information about \npayment options that include the costs and effects of negatively-amortizing payments.\n\n. For creditor-placed property insurance, requiring notice of the cost and coverage at least 45 days before imposing \na charge for such insurance.\n\nLoan Originator Compensation. The proposal contains new limits on originator compensation for all closed-end \nmortgages. The proposed changes include:\n\n. Prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or a loan officer that are based on the loan's terms and \nconditions.\n\n. Prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from \"steering\" consumers to transactions that are not in their interest \nin order to increase the mortgage broker's or loan officer's compensation.\n\nIII. The Board's Review of Closed-End Credit Rules\n\nThe Board has amended Regulation Z numerous times since TILA simplification in 1980. In 1987, the Board revised \nRegulation Z to require special disclosures for closed-end ARMs secured by the borrower's principal dwelling. 52 \nFR 48665; Dec. 24, 1987. In 1995, the Board revised Regulation Z to implement changes to TILA by the Home \nOwnership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). 60 FR 15463; Mar. 24, 1995. HOEPA requires special disclosures \nand substantive protections for home-equity loans and refinancings with APRs or points and fees above certain \nstatutory thresholds. Numerous other amendments have been made over the years to address new mortgage \nproducts and other matters, such as abusive lending practices in the mortgage and home-equity markets.\n\nThe Board's current review of Regulation Z was initiated in December 2004 with an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking. 1 69 FR 70925; Dec. 8, 2004. At that time, the Board announced its intent to conduct its review of \nRegulation Z in stages, focusing first on the rules for open-end (revolving) credit accounts that are not home-\nsecured, chiefly general-purpose credit cards and retailer credit card plans. In December 2008, the Board approved \nfinal rules for open-end credit that is not home-secured. 74 FR 5244; Jan. 29, 2009.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the Board proposed revisions to the rules for closed-end credit in several phases:\n\n1 The review was initiated pursuant to requirements of section 303 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory \nImprovement Act of 1994, section 610(c) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, and section 2222 of the Economic Growth and \nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. An advancenotice of proposed rulemaking is published to obtain preliminary \ninformation prior to issuing a proposed rule or, in some cases, deciding whether to issue a proposed rule.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. HOEPA. In 2007, the Board proposed rules under HOEPA for higher-priced mortgage loans (2007 HOEPA \nProposed Rule). The final rules, approved in July 2008 (2008 HOEPA Final Rule), prohibited certain unfair or \ndeceptive lending and servicing practices in connection with closed-end mortgages. The Board also approved \nrevisions to advertising rules for both closed-end and open-end home-secured loans to ensure that advertisements \ncontain accurate and balanced information and do not contain misleading or deceptive representations. The final \nrules also required creditors to provide consumers with transaction-specific disclosures early enough to use while \nshopping for a mortgage. 73 FR 44522; July 30, 2008.\n\n. Timing of Disclosures for Closed-End Mortgages. On May 7, 2009, the Board approved final rules implementing \nthe Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008 (the MDIA). 2 The MDIA adds to the requirements of the 2008 \nHOEPA Final Rule regarding transaction-specific disclosures. Among other things, the MDIA and the final rules \nrequire early, transaction-specific disclosures for mortgage loans secured by dwellings even when the dwelling is \nnot the consumer's principal dwelling, and requires waiting periods between the time when disclosures are given \nand consummation of the transaction. 74 FR 23289; May 19, 2009.\n\nThis proposal would revise the rules for disclosures for closed-end credit secured by real property or a consumer's \ndwelling. The Board anticipates reviewing the rules for rescission and reverse mortgages in the next phase of the \nRegulation Z review.\n\nA. Coordination With Disclosures Required Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act\n\nThe Board anticipates working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to ensure that TILA \nand Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) disclosures are compatible and complementary, \nincluding potentially developing a single disclosure form that creditors could use to combine the initial disclosures \nrequired under TILA and RESPA. The two statutes have different purposes but have considerable overlap. \nHarmonizing the two disclosure schemes would ensure that consumers receive consistent information under both \nlaws. It may also help reduce information overload by eliminating some duplicative disclosures. Consumer testing \nwould be used to ensure consumers could understand and use the combined disclosures. In the meantime, the \nBoard is proposing a revised model TILA form so that commenters can see how the Board's proposed revisions to \nRegulation Z might be applied in practice.\n\nRESPA, which is implemented by HUD's Regulation X, seeks to ensure that consumers are provided with timely \ninformation about the nature and costs of the settlement process and are protected from unnecessarily high real \nestate settlement charges. To this end, RESPA mandates that consumers receive information about the costs \nassociated with a mortgage loan transaction, and prohibits certain business practices. Under RESPA, creditors \nmust provide a GFE within three business days after a consumer submits a written application for a mortgage loan, \nwhich is the same time creditors must provide the early TILA disclosure. RESPA also requires a statement of the \nactual costs imposed at loan settlement (HUD-1 settlement statement). In November 2008, HUD published revised \nRESPA rules, including new GFE and HUD-1 settlement statement forms, which lenders, mortgage brokers, and \nsettlement agents must use beginning on January 1, 2010. 73 FR 68204; Nov. 17, 2008. In addition to revised \ndisclosures of settlement costs, the revised GFE now includes loan terms, some of which would also appear on the \nTILA disclosure, such as whether there is a prepayment penalty and the borrower's interest rate and monthly \npayment. The revised GFE form was developed through HUD's consumer testing.\n\n2 The MDIA is contained in Sections 2501 through 2503 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Public Law 110-\n289, enacted on July 30, 2008. The MDIA was later amended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Public Law \n110-343, enacted on October 3, 2008.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTILA, which is implemented by the Board's Regulation Z, governs the disclosure of the APR and certain loan terms. \nThis proposal contains a revised model TILA form that was developed through consumer testing. In addition to a \nrevised disclosure of the APR and loan terms, the revised TILA disclosure would include the total settlement \ncharges that appear on the GFE required under RESPA. Total settlement charges would be added to the TILA form \nbecause consumer testing conducted by the Board found that consumers wanted to have settlement charges \ndisclosed on the TILA form.\n\nThe proposed revised TILA form and HUD's revised GFE would represent significant improvements, but overlap \nbetween the two forms could be eliminated to reduce information overload and consistency issues. There have \nbeen previous efforts to develop a combined TILA and RESPA disclosure form, which were fueled by the amount, \ncomplexity, and overlap of information in the disclosures. Under a 1996 congressional directive, the Board and HUD \nstudied ways to simplify and improve the disclosures. In July 1998, the Board and HUD submitted a joint report to \nCongress that provided a broad outline intended to be a starting point for consideration of legislative reform of the \nmortgage disclosure requirements (the 1998 Joint Report). 3 The 1998 Joint Report included a recommendation for \ncombining and simplifying the RESPA and TILA disclosure forms to satisfy the requirements of both laws. In \naddition, The 1998 Joint Report recommended that the timing of the TILA and RESPA disclosures be coordinated. \nRecent regulatory changes addressed the timing issues so that initial disclosures required under TILA and RESPA \nwould be delivered at the same time.\n\nB. The Bankruptcy Act's Amendment to TILA\n\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (Bankruptcy Act) primarily amended the \nfederal bankruptcy code, but also contained several provisions amending TILA. With respect to open-end and \nclosed-end dwelling-secured credit, the Bankruptcy Act requires that the credit application disclosure contain a \nstatement warning consumers that if the loan exceeds the fair market value of the dwelling, then the interest on that \nportion of the loan is not tax deductible, and the consumer should consult a tax advisor for further information on tax \ndeductibility. This proposal would implement this Bankruptcy Act provision.\n\nC. The MDIA's Amendments to TILA\n\nOn July 30, 2008, Congress enacted the MDIA. 4 The MDIA codified some of the requirements of the Board's 2008 \nHOEPA Final Rule, which required transaction-specific disclosures to be provided within three business days after \nan application is received and before the consumer has paid a fee, other than a fee for obtaining the consumer's \ncredit history. 5 The MDIA also expanded coverage of the early disclosure requirement to include loans secured by \na dwelling even when it is not the consumer's principal dwelling. In addition, the MDIA required creditors to mail or \n\n3 Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. and U.S. Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev.,Joint Report to the Congress Concerning \nReform to the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (1998), available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/tila.pdf .\n\n \n\n \n\n4 As noted, Congress subsequently amended the MDIA with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\n\n5 To ease discussion, the description of theclosed-end mortgage disclosure scheme includes MDIA's recent amendments to \nTILA and the disclosure timing requirements of the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule that will be effective July 30, 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/tila.pdf\n\n\ndeliver early TILA disclosures at least seven business days before consummation and provide corrected \ndisclosures if the disclosed APR changes in excess of a specified tolerance. The consumer must receive the \ncorrected disclosures no later than three business days before consummation. The Board implemented these MDIA \nrequirements in final rules published May 19, 2009, and effective July 30, 2009. 74 FR 23289; May 19, 2009.\n\nThe MDIA also requires payment examples if the interest rate or payments can change. Such disclosures are to be \nformatted in accordance with the results of consumer testing conducted by the Board. Those provisions of the MDIA \nwill not become effective until January 30, 2011, or any earlier compliance date established by the Board. This \nproposal would implement those MDIA provisions.\n\nD. Consumer Testing\n\nA principal goal for the Regulation Z review is to produce revised and improved mortgage disclosures that \nconsumers will be more likely to understand and use in their decisions, while at the same time not creating undue \nburdens for creditors. Currently, Regulation Z requires creditors to provide at application an ARM loan program \ndisclosure and the CHARM booklet. An early TILA disclosure is required within three business days of application \nand at least seven business days before consummation for closed-end mortgages.\n\nIn 2007, the Board retained a research and consulting firm (ICF Macro) that specializes in designing and testing \ndocuments to conduct consumer testing to help the Board's review of mortgage rules under Regulation Z. Working \nclosely with the Board, ICF Macro conducted several tests in different cities throughout the United States. The \ntesting consisted of four focus groups and eleven rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews. The goals of these \nfocus groups and interviews were to learn how consumers shop for mortgages and what information consumers \nread when they receive mortgage disclosures, and to assess their understanding of such disclosures.\n\nThe consumer testing groups contained participants with a range of ethnicities, ages, educational levels, and \nmortgage behaviors, including first-time mortgage shoppers, prime and subprime borrowers, and consumers who \nhad obtained one or more closed-end mortgages. For each round of testing, ICF Macro developed a set of model \ndisclosure forms to be tested. Interview participants were asked to review model forms and provide their reactions, \nand were then asked a series of questions designed to test their understanding of the content. Data were collected \non which elements and features of each form were most successful in providing information clearly and effectively. \nThe findings from each round of interviews were incorporated in revisions to the model forms for the following round \nof testing.\n\nSpecifically, the Board worked with ICF Macro to develop and test several types of closed-end disclosures, \nincluding:\n\n. Two Board publications to be provided at application, entitled \"Key Questions To Ask About Your Mortgage\" and \n\"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\";\n\n. An ARM loan program disclosure to be provided at application;\n\n. An early TILA disclosure to be provided within three business days of application, and again so that the consumer \nreceives it at least three business days before consummation;\n\n. An ARM adjustment notice to be provided after consummation; and\n\n. A payment option monthly statement to be provided after consummation.\n\nExploratory focus groups. In February and March 2008 the Board worked with ICF Macro to conduct four focus \ngroups with consumers who had obtained a mortgage in the previous two years. Two of the groups consisted of \nsubprime borrowers and two consisted of prime borrowers, with creditworthiness determined by their answers to \n\n\n\nquestions about prior financial hardship, difficulties encountered in shopping for credit, and the rate on their current \nmortgage. Each focus group consisted of between seven and nine people that discussed issues identified by the \nBoard and raised by a moderator from ICF Macro. Through these focus groups, the Board gathered information on \nhow consumers shop for mortgages, what information consumers currently use in making decisions about \nmortgages, and what perceptions consumers had of TILA disclosures currently provided in the shopping and \napplication process.\n\nCognitive interviews on existing disclosures. In 2008, the Board worked with ICF Macro to conduct five rounds of \ncognitive interviews with mortgage customers (seven to eleven participants per round). These cognitive interviews \nconsisted of one-on-one discussions with consumers, during which consumers described their recent mortgage \nshopping experience and reviewed existing sample mortgage disclosures. In addition to learning about shopping \nbehavior, the goals of these interviews were: (1) To learn more about what information consumers read when they \nreceive current mortgage disclosures; (2) to research how easily consumers can find various pieces of information \nin these disclosures; and (3) to test consumers' understanding of certain mortgage related words and phrases.\n\n1. Initial design of disclosures for testing. In the fall of 2008, the Board worked with ICF Macro to develop sample \nmortgage disclosures to be used in later rounds of testing, taking into account information learned through the focus \ngroups and the cognitive interviews.\n\n2. Additional cognitive interviews and revisions to disclosures. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Board worked with \nICF Macro to conduct six additional rounds of cognitive interviews (nine or ten participants per round), where \nconsumers were asked to view new sample mortgage disclosures developed by the Board and ICF Macro. The \nrounds of interviews were conducted sequentially to allow for revisions to the testing materials based on what was \nlearned from the testing during each previous round.\n\nResults of testing. Several of the model forms were developed through the testing. A report summarizing the results \nof the testing is available on the Board's public Web site: http://www.federalreserve.gov.\n\nMany consumer testing participants reported that they did not shop for a lender or a mortgage. Several stated that \nthey were referred to a lender by a realtor, family member or friend, and that they relied on that lender to get them a \nloan. Participants who reported shopping for a mortgage relied on originators' oral quotes for interest rates, monthly \npayments, and closing costs. Most participants stated that once they had applied for a particular loan and received \na TILA disclosure they ceased shopping. Some cited the time involved, and the amount of documentation required, \nas factors for limiting their shopping. These findings suggest that consumers need information early in the process \nand that information should not be limited to information about ARMs. Therefore, the proposal would require \ncreditors to provide key information about evaluating loan terms at the time an application form is provided, as \ndiscussed below.\n\n1. Disclosures provided to consumers before application. Currently, creditors must provide the CHARM booklet \nbefore a consumer applies or pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. The booklet explains how ARMs \ngenerally work. Testing showed that participants found the CHARM booklet too lengthy to be useful, although \nsome liked specific elements such as the glossary. In addition, creditors must provide an ARM loan program \ndisclosure for each ARM loan program in which the consumer expresses an interest, before the consumer applies \nor has paid a nonrefundable fee. The ARM loan program disclosure currently must include either a 15-year \nhistorical example of rates and payments for a $ 10,000 loan, or the maximum interest rate and payment for a $ \n10,000 loan originated at the interest rate in effect for the disclosure's identified month and year. Many testing \nparticipants found the narrative form of the current ARM loan program disclosure difficult to read and understand. \nSome participants mistook the historical examples to be their actual loan rate and payments. Participants also \nfound the content of the disclosure too general to be useful to them when comparing between lenders or products, \nand noted the absence of key loan information, such as the interest rate.\n\nThus, the proposal would require creditors to provide, for all closed-end mortgages, a one-page document that \nexplains the basic differences between fixed-rate mortgages and ARMs, and a one-page document that would \n\n\n\nexplain potentially risky features of a mortgage in a plain-English question and answer format. In addition, the \nproposal would streamline the content of the ARM loan program disclosure to highlight in a table form information \nthat participants found most useful, such as interest rate and payment adjustments, and to provide information \nabout program-specific loan features that could pose greater risk, such as prepayment penalties. Consumer testing \nsuggested that highlighting such information in a table form improved participants' ability to identify and understand \nthe information provided about key loan features.\n\n2. Disclosures provided to consumers after application. Currently, creditors must provide an early TILA disclosure \nwithin three business days after application and at least seven business days before consummation, and before the \nconsumer has paid a fee other than a fee for obtaining the consumer's credit history. If the APR on the early TILA \ndisclosure exceeds a certain tolerance before consummation, the creditor must provide corrected disclosures that \nthe consumer must receive at least three days before consummation. If any term other than the APR becomes \ninaccurate, the creditor must give the corrected disclosure no later than at consummation.\n\nThe early TILA disclosure--and any corrected disclosure--must provide certain information, such as the loan's \nannual percentage rate (APR), finance charge, amount financed, and total of payments. Participants in consumer \ntesting indicated that much of the information in the current TILA disclosure was of secondary importance to them \nwhen considering a loan. Participants consistently looked for the contract rate of interest, monthly payment, and in \nsome cases, closing costs. Most participants assumed that the APR was the contract rate of interest, and that the \nfinance charge was the total of all interest they would pay if they kept the loan to maturity. Most identified the \namount financed as the loan amount. When asked to compare two loan offers using redesigned model forms that \ncontained these disclosures, few participants used the APR and finance charge to compare the loans. In addition, \nsome participants had difficulty determining whether the loan tested had a variable or fixed rate and understanding \nthe payment schedule's relationship to the changing interest rate. Many did not understand what circumstances \nwould trigger a prepayment penalty.\n\nThus, the proposal contains a number of revisions to the format and content of TILA disclosures to make them \nclearer and more conspicuous. To enhance the effectiveness of the finance charge as a disclosure of the true cost \nof credit, the proposal would require a simpler, more inclusive approach. The disclosure of the APR would be \nenhanced to improve consumers' comprehension of the cost of credit. In addition, to help consumers determine \nwhether the loan offered is affordable for them, creditors would be required to summarize key loan terms and \nhighlight interest rate and payment information in a table. Consumer testing showed that using special formatting \nrequirements, consistent terminology and a minimum 10-point font, would ensure that consumers are better able to \nidentify and review key loan terms.\n\n3. Disclosures required after consummation. Currently, creditors must provide advance notice to a consumer before \nthe interest rate and monthly payment adjust on an ARM. The ARM adjustment notice must provide certain \ninformation, including current and prior interest rates, the index values upon which the current and prior interest \nrates are based, and the payment that would be required to amortize the loan fully at the new interest rate. The \nBoard worked with ICF Macro to develop a revised ARM adjustment notice that would enhance consumers' ability \nto identify and understand changes being made to their loan terms. Consumer testing of the revised ARM \nadjustment notice indicated that consumers understood the content and were able correctly to identify the amount \nand due date of the new payment. Thus, under the proposal, creditors would be required to provide the ARM \nadjustment notice in a revised format that would highlight changes being made to the interest rate and the monthly \npayment, and provide other important information, such as the due date of the new payment and the loan balance.\n\nCurrently, creditors are not required to provide disclosures after consummation for negatively-amortizing loans. The \nBoard worked with ICF Macro to develop a monthly statement that compares the amount and the impact on the \nloan balance of a fully-amortizing payment, interest-only payment, and minimum payment. Consumer testing of the \nproposed monthly statement indicated that consumers understood the content, easily recognized the payment \noptions highlighted in the table, and understood that by making only the minimum payment they would be borrowing \nmore money and increasing their loan balance. Thus, to improve consumer understanding of the risks associated \n\n\n\nwith payment option loans, the Board proposes to require, not later than 15 days before a periodic payment is due, \na monthly statement of payment options that explains the impact of payment choice on the loan balance.\n\nAdditional testing during and after the comment period. During the comment period, the Board will work with ICF \nMacro to conduct additional testing of model disclosures. After receiving comments from the public on the proposal \nand the proposed disclosure forms, the Board will work with ICF Macro to further revise model disclosures based on \ncomments received, and to conduct additional rounds of cognitive interviews to test the revised disclosures. After \nthe cognitive interviews, quantitative testing will be conducted. The goal of the quantitative testing is to measure \nconsumers' comprehension of the newly-developed disclosures with a larger and more statistically representative \ngroup of consumers.\n\nE. Other Outreach and Research\n\nThe Board also solicited input from members of the Board's Consumer Advisory Council on various issues \npresented by the review of Regulation Z. During 2009, for example, the Council discussed ways to improve \ndisclosures for home-secured credit. In addition, Board staff met or conducted conference calls with various \nindustry and consumer group representatives throughout the review process leading to this proposal. Board staff \nalso reviewed disclosures currently provided by creditors, the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) report on \nconsumer testing of mortgage disclosures, 6 HUD's report on consumer testing of the GFE, 7 and other information.\n\nF. Reviewing Regulation Z in Stages\n\nThe Board is proceeding with a review of Regulation Z in stages. This proposal largely contains revisions to rules \naffecting closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Published elsewhere in today's \nFederal Register is the Board's proposal regarding disclosures for open-end credit secured by a consumer's \ndwelling. Closed-end mortgages are distinct from other TILA-covered products, and conducting a review in stages \nallows for a manageable process. To minimize compliance burden for creditors offering other closed-end credit, as \nwell as home-secured credit, the proposed rules that would apply only to closed-end home-secured credit are \norganized in sections separate from the general disclosure requirements for closed-end rules. Although this \nreorganization would increase the size of the regulation and commentary, the Board believes a clear delineation of \nrules for closed-end, home-secured loans pending the review of the remaining closed-end rules provides a clear \ncompliance benefit to creditors.\n\nG. Implementation Period\n\nThe Board contemplates providing creditors sufficient time to implement any revisions that may be adopted. The \nBoard seeks comment on an appropriate implementation period.\n\n6 James M. Lacko and Janis K. Pappalardo, Fed.

The Board's Rulemaking Authority\n\nTILA Section 105. TILA mandates that the Board prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of the act. TILA \nalso specifically authorizes the Board, among other things, to:\n\n. Issue regulations that contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, or that provide for such \nadjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, that in the Board's judgment are necessary or proper to \neffectuate the purposes of TILA, facilitate compliance with the act, or prevent circumvention or evasion. 15 U.S.C. \n1604(a).\n\n. Exempt from all or part of TILA any class of transactions if the Board determines that TILA coverage does not \nprovide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection. The Board must consider \nfactors identified in the act and publish its rationale at the time it proposes an exemption for comment. 15 U.S.C. \n1604(f).\n\nIn the course of developing the proposal, the Board has considered the views of interested parties, its experience in \nimplementing and enforcing Regulation Z, and the results obtained from testing various disclosure options in \ncontrolled consumer tests. For the reasons discussed in this notice, the Board believes this proposal is appropriate \npursuant to the authority under TILA Section 105(a).\n\nAlso, as explained in this notice, the Board believes that the specific exemptions proposed are appropriate because \nthe existing requirements do not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or \nprotection. In reaching this conclusion with each proposed exemption, the Board considered (1) the amount of the \nloan and whether the disclosure provides a benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction involving a loan \nof such amount; (2) the extent to which the requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more expensive the credit \nprocess; (3) the status of the borrower, including any related financial arrangements of the borrower, the financial \nsophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction, and the importance to the borrower of the credit, \nrelated supporting property, and coverage under TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of \nthe borrower; and (5) whether the exemption would undermine the goal of consumer protection. The rationales for \nthese proposed exemptions are explained in part VI below.\n\nTILA Section 129(l)(2). TILA also authorizes the Board to prohibit acts or practices in connection with:\n\n. Mortgage loans that the board finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of HOEPA; and\n\n. Refinancing of mortgage loans that the Board finds to be associated with abusive lending practices or that are \notherwise not in the interest of the borrower.\n\nThe authority granted to the Board under TILA Section 129(l)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1639(l)(2), is broad. It reaches mortgage \nloans with rates and fees that do not meet HOEPA's rate or fee trigger in TILA Section 103(aa), 15 U.S.C. \n1602(aa), as well as mortgage loans not covered under that section, such as home purchase loans. Moreover, \nwhile HOEPA's statutory restrictions apply only to creditors and only to loan terms or lending practices, Section \n129(l)(2) is not limited to acts or practices by creditors, nor is it limited to loan terms or lending practices. See 15 \nU.S.C. 1639(l)(2). It authorizes protections against unfair or deceptive practices \"in connection with mortgage \nloans,\" and it authorizes protections against abusive practices \"in connection with refinancing of mortgage loans.\" \nThus, the Board's authority is not limited to regulating specific contractual terms of mortgage loan agreements; it \nextends to regulating loan-related practices generally, within the standards set forth in the statute.\n\nHOEPA does not set forth a standard for what is unfair or deceptive, but the Conference Report for HOEPA \nindicates that, in determining whether a practice in connection with mortgage loans is unfair or deceptive, the Board \nshould look to the standards employed for interpreting State unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes and the \nFederal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), Section 5(a), 15 U.S.C. 45(a). 8\n\n8 H.R. Rep. 103-652, at 162 (1994) (Conf. Rep.).\n\n\n\nCongress has codified standards developed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for determining whether acts \nor practices are unfair under Section 5(a), 15 U.S.C. 45(a). 9 Under the FTC Act, an act or practice is unfair when it \ncauses or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers \nthemselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. In addition, in \ndetermining whether an act or practice is unfair, the FTC is permitted to consider established public policies, but \npublic policy considerations may not serve as the primary basis for an unfairness determination. 10\n\nThe FTC has interpreted these standards to mean that consumer injury is the central focus of any inquiry regarding \nunfairness. 11 Consumer injury may be substantial if it imposes a small harm on a large number of consumers, or if \nit raises a significant risk of concrete harm. 12 The FTC looks to whether an act or practice is injurious in its net \neffects. 13 The FTC has also observed that an unfair act or practice will almost always reflect a market failure or \nmarket imperfection that prevents the forces of supply and demand from maximizing benefits and minimizing costs. \n14 In evaluating unfairness, the FTC looks to whether consumers' free market decisions are unjustifiably hindered. \n15\n\nThe FTC has also adopted standards for determining whether an act or practice is deceptive (though these \nstandards, unlike unfairness standards, have not been incorporated into the FTC Act). 16 First, there must be a \nrepresentation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer. Second, the act or practice is examined \nfrom the perspective of a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances. Third, the representation, omission, or \n\n \n\n \n\n9 See 15 U.S.C. 45(n); Letter from Commissioners of the FTC to the Hon. Wendell H. Ford, Chairman, and the Hon.

That is, it must be likely to affect the consumer's conduct or decision with regard to a \nproduct or service. 17\n\nMany States also have adopted statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and these statutes employ \na variety of standards, many of them different from the standards currently applied to the FTC Act. A number of \nStates follow an unfairness standard formerly used by the FTC. Under this standard, an act or practice is unfair \nwhere it offends public policy; or is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; and causes substantial injury to \nconsumers. 18\n\nIn developing proposed rules under TILA Section 129(l)(2)(A), 15 U.S.C. 1639(l)(2)(A), the Board has considered \nthe standards currently applied to the FTC Act's prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as well as \nthe standards applied to similar State statutes.\n\nV. Discussion of Major Proposed Revisions\n\nThe goal of the proposed revisions is to improve the effectiveness of the Regulation Z disclosures that must be \nprovided to consumers for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. To shop for and \nunderstand the cost of home-secured credit, consumers must be able to identify and comprehend the key terms of \nmortgages. But the terms and conditions for mortgage transactions can be very complex. The proposed revisions to \nRegulation Z are intended to provide the most essential information to consumers when the information would be \nmost useful to them, with content and formats that are clear and conspicuous. The proposed revisions are expected \nto improve consumers' ability to make informed credit decisions and enhance competition among creditors. Many of \nthe changes are based on the consumer testing that was conducted in connection with the review of Regulation Z.\n\nIn considering the proposed revisions, the Board sought to ensure that the proposal would not reduce access to \ncredit, and sought to balance the potential benefits for consumers with the compliance burdens imposed on \ncreditors. For example, the proposed revisions seek to provide greater certainty to creditors in identifying what costs \nmust be disclosed for mortgages, and how those costs must be disclosed. More effective disclosures may also \n\n \n\n16 Letter from James C. Miller III, Chairman, FTC to the Hon. John D. Dingell, Chairman, H.

Disclosures at Application\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires preapplication disclosures only for variable-rate transactions. For these \ntransactions, creditors are required to provide the CHARM booklet and a loan program disclosure that provides \ntwelve items of information at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable \nfee, whichever is earlier.\n\n\"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage\" publication. Since 1987, the number of loan products and product \nfeatures has grown, providing consumers with more choices. However, the growth in loan features and products \nhas also made the decision-making process more complex for consumers. The proposal would require creditors to \nprovide to consumers a one-page Board publication entitled, \"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage.\" \nCreditors would be required to provide this document for all closed-end loans secured by real property or a \ndwelling, not just variable-rate loans, before the consumer applies for a loan or pays a nonrefundable fee, \nwhichever is earlier. The publication would inform consumers in a plain-English question and answer format about \npotentially risky features, such as interest-only, negative amortization, and prepayment penalties. To enable \nconsumers to track the presence or absence of potentially risky features throughout the mortgage transaction \nprocess, the key questions and answers provided in this one-page document would also be included in the ARM \nloan program disclosure and the early and final TILA disclosures.\n\n\"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\" publication. Instead of the CHARM booklet, the proposal would require \ncreditors to provide a one-page Board publication entitled, \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\" for all closed-end \nloans secured by real property or a dwelling, not just variable-rate loans. The publication would contain an \nexplanation of the basic differences between fixed-rate mortgages and ARMs. Although the requirement to provide \na CHARM booklet would be eliminated, the Board would continue to publish the CHARM booklet as a consumer-\neducation publication.\n\nARM loan program disclosure. Currently, for each variable-rate loan program in which a consumer expresses an \ninterest, creditors must provide certain information, including the index and margin to be used to calculate interest \nrates and payments, and either a 15-year historical example of rates and payments for a $ 10,000 loan, or the \nmaximum interest rate and payment for a $ 10,000 loan originated at the interest rate in effect for the disclosure's \nidentified month and year. Based on consumer testing, the proposal would simplify the ARM loan program \ndisclosure to focus on the interest rate and payment and the potential risks associated with ARMs. Information on \nhow to calculate payments, and the effect of rising interest rates on monthly payments would be moved to the early \nTILA disclosure provided after application. Placing the information there will allow the creditor to customize the \ninformation to the consumer's potential loan, making the information more useful to consumers. The proposed ARM \nloan program disclosure would be provided in a tabular question and answer format to enable consumers to easily \nlocate the most important information.\n\nB. Disclosures Within Three Days After Application\n\nTILA and Regulation Z currently require creditors to provide an early TILA disclosure within three business days \nafter application and at least seven business days before consummation, and before the consumer has paid a fee \nother than a fee for obtaining the consumer's credit history. If the APR on the early TILA disclosure exceeds a \ncertain tolerance before consummation, the creditor must provide corrected disclosures that the consumer must \nreceive at least three days before consummation. If any term other than the APR becomes inaccurate, the creditor \nmust give the corrected disclosure no later than at consummation.\n\n\n\nThe early TILA disclosure, and any corrected disclosure, must include certain loan information, including the \namount financed, the finance charge, the APR, the total of payments, and the amount and timing of payments. The \nfinance charge is the sum of all credit-related charges, but excludes a variety of fees and charges. TILA requires \nthat the finance charge and the APR be disclosed more conspicuously than other information. The APR is \ncalculated based on the finance charge and is meant to be a single, unified number to help consumers understand \nthe total cost of credit.\n\nCalculation of the finance charge. The proposal contains a number of revisions to the calculation of the finance \ncharge and the disclosure of the finance charge and the APR to improve consumers' understanding of the cost of \ncredit. Currently, TILA and Regulation Z permit creditors to exclude several fees or charges from the finance \ncharge, including certain fees or charges imposed by third party closing agents; certain premiums for credit or \nproperty insurance or fees for debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage, if the creditor meets certain \nconditions; security interest charges; and real-estate related fees, such as title examination or document \npreparation fees.\n\nConsumer groups, creditors, and government agencies have long been dissatisfied with the \"some fees in, some \nfees out\" approach to the finance charge. Consumer groups and others believe that the current approach obscures \nthe true cost of credit. They contend that this approach creates incentives for creditors to shift the cost of credit from \nthe interest rate to ancillary fees excluded from the finance charge. They further contend that this approach \nundermines the purpose of the APR, which is to express in a single figure the total cost of credit. Creditors maintain \nthat consumers are confused by the APR and that the current approach creates significant regulatory burdens. \nThey contend that determining which fees are or are not included in the finance charge is overly complex and \ncreates litigation risk.\n\nThe Board proposes to use its exception and exemption authority to revise the finance charge calculation for \nclosed-end mortgages, including HOEPA loans. The proposal would maintain TILA's definition of a \"finance charge\" \nas a fee or charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as \nan incident to the extension of credit. However, the proposal would require the finance charge to include charges by \nthird parties if the creditor requires the use of a third party as a condition of or incident to the extension of credit \n(even if the consumer chooses the third party), or if the creditor retains a portion of the third-party charge (to the \nextent of the portion retained). Charges that would be incurred in a comparable cash transaction, such as transfer \ntaxes, would continue to be excluded from the finance charge. Under this approach, consumers would benefit from \nhaving a finance charge and APR disclosure that better represent the cost of credit, undiluted by myriad exclusions \nfor various fees and charges. This approach would cause more loans to be subject to the special protections of the \nBoard's 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, special disclosures and restrictions for HOEPA loans, and certain State anti-\npredatory lending laws. However, the proposal could also reduce compliance burdens, regulatory uncertainty, and \nlitigation risks for creditors.\n\nDisclosure of the finance charge and the APR. Currently, creditors are required to disclose the loan's \"finance \ncharge\" and \"annual percentage rate,\" using those terms, more conspicuously than the other required disclosures. \nConsumer testing indicated that consumers do not understand the term \"finance charge.\" Most consumers believe \nthe term refers to the total of all interest they would pay if they keep the loan to maturity, but do not realize that it \nincludes the fees and costs associated with the loan. For these reasons, the proposal replaces the term \"finance \ncharge\" with \"interest and settlement charges\" to make clear it is more than interest, and the disclosure would no \nlonger be more conspicuous than the other required disclosures.\n\nIn addition, the disclosure of the APR would be enhanced to improve consumers' comprehension of the cost of \ncredit. Under the proposal, creditors would be required to disclose the APR in 16-point font in close proximity to a \ngraph that compares the consumer's APR to the HOEPA average prime offer rate for borrowers with excellent \ncredit and the HOEPA threshold for higher-priced loans. This disclosure would put the APR in context and help \nconsumers understand whether they are being offered a loan that comports with their creditworthiness.\n\n\n\nInterest rate and payment summary. Currently, creditors are required to disclose the number, amount, and timing of \npayments scheduled to repay the loan. Under the MDIA's amendments to TILA, creditors will be required to provide \nexamples of adjustments to the regularly required payment based on the change in interest rates specified in the \ncontract. Consumer testing consistently indicated that consumers shop for and evaluate a mortgage based on the \ncontract interest rate and the monthly payment, but consumers have difficulty understanding such terms using the \ncurrent TILA disclosure. Under the proposal, creditors would be required to disclose in a tabular format the contract \ninterest rate together with the corresponding monthly payment, including escrows for taxes and property and/or \nmortgage insurance. Special disclosure requirements would be imposed for adjustable-rate or step-rate loans to \nshow the interest rate and payment at consummation, the maximum interest rate and payment at first adjustment, \nand the highest possible maximum interest rate and payment. Additional special disclosures would be required for \nloans with negatively-amortizing payment options, introductory interest rates, interest-only payments, and balloon \npayments.\n\nDisclosure of other terms. In addition to the interest rate and monthly payment, consumer testing indicated that \nconsumers benefit from the disclosure of other key terms in a clear format. Thus, the proposal would require \ncreditors to provide in a tabular format information about the loan amount, the loan term, the loan type (such as \nfixed-rate), the total settlement charges, and the maximum amount of any prepayment penalty. In addition, creditors \nwould be required to disclose in a tabular question and answer format the \"Key Questions about Risk,\" which would \ninclude information about potentially risky loan features such as prepayment penalties, interest-only payments, and \nnegative amortization.\n\nC. Disclosures Three Days Before Consummation\n\nAs noted above, the creditor is required to provide the early TILA disclosure to the consumer within three business \ndays after receiving the consumer's written application and at least seven business days before consummation, and \nbefore the consumer has paid a fee other than a fee for obtaining the consumer's credit history. If the APR on the \nearly TILA disclosure exceeds a certain tolerance before consummation, the creditor must provide corrected \ndisclosures that the consumer must receive at least three days before consummation. If any term other than the \nAPR becomes inaccurate, the creditor must give the corrected disclosure no later than at consummation. The \nconsumer may waive the seven- and three-day waiting periods for a bona fide personal financial emergency.\n\nThere are, however, long-standing concerns about consumers facing different loan terms or increased settlement \ncosts at closing. Members of the Board's Consumer Advisory Council, participants in public hearings, and \ncommenters on prior Board rulemakings have expressed concern about consumers not learning of changes to \ncredit terms or settlement charges until consummation. In addition, consumer testing indicated that consumers are \noften surprised at closing by changes in important loan terms, such as the addition of an adjustable-rate feature. \nDespite these changes, consumers report that they have proceeded with closing because they lacked alternatives \n(especially in the case of a home purchase loan), or were told that they could easily refinance with better terms in \nthe near future.\n\nFor these reasons, the proposal would require the creditor to provide a final TILA disclosure that the consumer must \nreceive at least three business days before consummation, even if no terms have changed since the early TILA \ndisclosure was provided. In addition, the Board is proposing two alternative approaches to address changes to loan \nterms and settlement charges during the three-business-day waiting period. Under the first approach, if any terms \nchange during the three-business-day waiting period, the creditor would be required to provide another final TILA \ndisclosure and wait an additional three business days before consummation could occur. Under the second \napproach, creditors would be required to provide another final TILA disclosure, but would have to wait an additional \nthree business days before consummation only if the APR exceeds a designated tolerance or the creditor adds an \nadjustable-rate feature. Otherwise, the creditor would be permitted to provide the new final TILA disclosure at \nconsummation.\n\n\n\nD. Disclosures After Consummation\n\nRegulation Z requires certain notices to be provided after consummation. Currently, for variable-rate transactions, \ncreditors are required to provide advance notice of an interest rate adjustment. There are no disclosure \nrequirements for other post-consummation events.\n\nARM adjustment notice. Currently, for variable-rate transactions, creditors are required to provide a notice of \ninterest rate adjustment at least 25, but no more than 120, calendar days before a payment at a new level is due. In \naddition, creditors must provide an adjustment notice at least once each year during which an interest rate \nadjustment is implemented without an accompanying payment change. These disclosures must include certain \ninformation, including the current and prior interest rates and the index values upon which the current and prior \ninterest rates are based.\n\nUnder the proposal, creditors would be required to provide the ARM adjustment notice at least 60 days before \npayment at a new level is due. This proposal seeks to address concerns that consumers need more than 25 days to \nseek out a refinancing in the event of a payment adjustment. This notice is particularly critical for subprime \nborrowers who may be more vulnerable to payment shock and may have a more difficult time refinancing a loan.\n\nPayment option statement. Currently, creditors are not required to provide disclosures after consummation for \nnegatively amortizing loans, such as payment option loans. To ensure consumers receive information about the \nrisks associated with payment option loans (e.g., payment shock), the proposal would require creditors to provide a \nperiodic statement for payment option loans that have negative amortization. The disclosure would contain a table \nwith a comparison of the amount and impact on the loan balance and property equity of a fully-amortizing payment, \ninterest-only payment, and minimum negatively-amortizing payment. This disclosure would be provided not later \nthan 15 days before a periodic payment is due.\n\nCreditor-placed property insurance notice. Creditors are not currently required under Regulation Z to provide notice \nbefore charging for creditor-placed property insurance. Industry reports indicate that the volume of creditor-placed \nproperty insurance has increased significantly. Consumers struggling financially may fail to pay required property \ninsurance premiums unaware that creditors have the right to obtain such insurance on their behalf and add the \npremiums to their outstanding loan balance. Such premiums are often considerably more expensive than premiums \nfor insurance obtained by the consumer. Thus, under the proposal, creditors would be required to provide notice to \nconsumers of the cost and coverage of creditor-placed property insurance at least 45 days before a charge is \nimposed for such insurance. In addition, creditors would be required to provide consumers with evidence of such \ninsurance within 15 days of imposing a charge for the insurance.\n\nE. Prohibitions on Payments to Loan Originators and Steering\n\nCurrently, creditors pay commissions to loan originators in the form of \"yield spread premiums.\" A yield spread \npremium is the present dollar value of the difference between the lowest interest rate a lender would have accepted \non a particular transaction and the interest rate a loan originator actually obtained for the lender. Some or all of this \ndollar value is usually paid to the loan originator by the creditor as a form of compensation, though it may also be \napplied to other closing costs.\n\nYield spread premiums can create financial incentives to steer consumers to riskier loans for which loan originators \nwill receive greater compensation. Consumers generally are not aware of loan originators' conflict of interest and \ncannot reasonably protect themselves against it. Yield spread premiums may provide some benefit to consumers \nbecause consumers do not have to pay loan originators' compensation in cash or through financing. However, the \nBoard believes that this benefit may be outweighed by costs to consumers, such as when consumers pay a higher \ninterest rate or obtain a loan with terms the consumer may not otherwise have chosen, such as a prepayment \npenalty or an adjustable rate.\n\n\n\nIn response to these concerns, the 2007 HOEPA Proposed Rule attempted to address the potential unfairness \nthrough disclosure. The proposal would have prohibited a creditor from paying a mortgage broker more than the \nconsumer had previously agreed in writing that the mortgage broker would receive. A mortgage broker would have \nhad to enter into the written agreement with the consumer, before accepting the consumer's loan application and \nbefore the consumer paid any fee in connection with the transaction (other than a fee for obtaining a credit report). \nThe agreement also would have disclosed (1) that the consumer ultimately would bear the cost of the entire \ncompensation even if the creditor paid part of it directly; and (2) that a creditor's payment to a broker could influence \nthe broker to offer the consumer loan terms or products that would not be in the consumer's interest or the most \nfavorable the consumer could obtain.\n\nBased on analysis of comments received on the 2007 HOEPA Proposed Rule, the results of consumer testing, and \nother information, the Board withdrew the proposed provisions relating to broker compensation in the 2008 HOEPA \nFinal Rule. In particular, the Board's consumer testing raised concerns that the proposed agreement and \ndisclosures would confuse consumers and undermine their decisionmaking rather than improve it. Participants often \nconcluded, not necessarily correctly, that brokers are more expensive than creditors. Many also believed that \nbrokers would serve their best interests notwithstanding the conflict resulting from the relationship between interest \nrates and brokers' compensation. 19 The proposed disclosures presented a significant risk of misleading consumers \nregarding both the relative costs of brokers and lenders and the role of brokers in their transactions. In withdrawing \nthe broker compensation provisions of the HOEPA proposal, the Board stated it would continue to explore options \nto address potential unfairness associated with loan originator compensation arrangements.\n\nTo address the concerns related to loan originator compensation, the Board proposes to prohibit payments to loan \noriginators that are based on the loan's terms and conditions. This prohibition would not apply to payments that \nconsumers make directly to loan originators. The Board solicits comment on an alternative that would allow loan \noriginators to receive payments that are based on the principal loan amount, which is a common practice today. If a \nconsumer directly pays the loan originator, the proposal would prohibit the loan originator from also receiving \ncompensation from any other party in connection with that transaction. These rules would be proposed under the \nBoard's HOEPA authority to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans.\n\nUnder the proposal, a \"loan originator\" would include both mortgage brokers and employees of creditors who \nperform loan origination functions. The 2007 HOEPA Proposed Rule covered only mortgage brokers. However, a \ncreditor's loan officers frequently have the same discretion as mortgage brokers to modify loans' terms to increase \ntheir compensation, and there is evidence that creditors' loan officers engage in such practices.\n\nThe Board also seeks comment on an optional proposal that would prohibit loan originators from directing or \n\"steering\" consumers to a particular creditor's loan products based on the fact that the loan originator will receive \nadditional compensation even when that loan may not be in the consumer's best interest. The Board solicits \ncomment on whether the proposed rule would be effective in achieving the stated purpose. In addition, the Board \nsolicits comment on the feasibility and practicality of such a rule, its enforceability, and any unintended adverse \neffects the rule might have.\n\nF. Additional Protections\n\n19 See Macro International, Inc., Consumer Testing of Mortgage Broker Disclosures (July 10, 2008), available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714regzconstest.pdf .\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714regzconstest.pdf\n\n\nCredit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage eligibility for all loan transactions. Currently, \ncreditors may exclude from the finance charge a premium or charge for credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension coverage if the creditor discloses the voluntary nature and cost of the product, and the consumer signs \nor initials an affirmative request for the product. Concerns have been raised about creditors who sometimes offer \nproducts that contain eligibility restrictions, specifically age or employment restrictions, but do not evaluate whether \napplicants for the products actually meet the eligibility restrictions at the time of enrollment. Subsequently, \nconsumers' claims for benefits may be denied because they did not meet the eligibility restrictions at the time of \nenrollment. Consumers are presumably unaware that they are paying for a product for which they will derive no \nbenefit. Under the proposal, creditors would be required to determine whether the consumer meets the age and/or \nemployment eligibility criteria at the time of enrollment in the product and provide a disclosure that such a \ndetermination has been made. The proposal is not limited to mortgage transactions and would apply to all closed-\nend and open-end transactions.\n\nVI. Section-by-Section Analysis\n\nSection 226.1 Authority, Purpose, Coverage, Organization, Enforcement, and Liability\n\n1(b) Purpose\n\nSection 226.1(b) would be revised to reflect the fact that \u00a7 226.35 prohibits certain acts or practices for transactions \nsecured by the consumer's principal dwelling. In addition, \u00a7 226.1(b) would be revised to reflect the proposal to \nbroaden the scope of \u00a7 226.36 (from transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling to all transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling).\n\n1(d) Organization\n\n1(d)(5)\n\nThe Board proposes to revise \u00a7 226.1(d)(5) to reflect the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 226.32, 226.34, and 226.35. The Board would \nalso revise \u00a7 226.1(d)(5) to reflect the proposed change in the scope of \u00a7 226.36, and the addition of new \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.37 and 226.38.\n\nSection 226.2 Definitions and Rules\n\n2(a) Definitions\n\n2(a)(24) Residential Mortgage Transaction\n\nRegulation Z, \u00a7 226.2(a)(24), defines a \"residential mortgage transaction\" as \"a transaction in which a mortgage, \ndeed of trust, purchase money security interest arising under an installment sales contract, or equivalent \nconsensual security interest is created or retained in the consumer's principal dwelling to finance the acquisition or \ninitial construction of that dwelling.\" Currently, comment 2(a)(24)-1 states that the term is important in five \nprovisions in Regulation Z, including assumption under \u00a7\u00a7 226.18(q) and 226.20(b). However, the proposed rule \nwould expand coverage of the assumption rules to cover any closed-end credit transaction secured by real property \nor a dwelling. Thus, the Board proposes to revise comments 2(a)(24)-1, -2, and -5 to reflect this change.\n\nSection 226.3 Exempt Transactions\n\n\n\n3(b) Credit Over $ 25,000 Not Secured by Real Property or a Dwelling\n\nTILA and Regulation Z cover all credit transactions that are secured by real property or a principal dwelling in which \nthe amount financed exceeds $ 25,000. 15 U.S.C. 1603(3). Section 226.3(b), which implements TILA Section \n104(3), provides that credit transactions over $ 25,000 not secured by real property, or by personal property used or \nexpected to be used as the principal dwelling of the consumer, are exempt from Regulation Z. 15 U.S.C. 1603(3).\n\nAs noted in the discussion under \u00a7\u00a7 226.19 and 226.38, the Board proposes to require creditors to provide certain \ndisclosures for all closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, not just principal dwellings. \nHowever, the Board recognizes that, if personal property that is a dwelling but not the borrower's principal dwelling \nsecures a loan of over $ 25,000, it is not covered by TILA in the first instance. For example, Regulation Z does not \napply to a $ 26,000 loan that is secured by a manufactured home that is not the consumer's second or vacation \nhome. Notwithstanding this exemption, the Board solicits comment on whether consumers in these transactions \nreceive adequate information regarding their loan terms and are afforded sufficient protections. The Board also \nseeks comment on the relative benefits and costs of applying Regulation Z to these transactions.\n\nSection 226.4 Finance Charge\n\nBackground\n\nSection 106(a) of TILA provides that the finance charge in a consumer credit transaction is \"the sum of all charges, \npayable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the \ncreditor as an incident to the extension of credit.\" 15 U.S.C. 1605(a). The finance charge does not include charges \nof a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Id. The finance charge does not include fees or charges \nimposed by third party closing agents, such as settlement agents, attorneys, and title companies, if the creditor \ndoes not require the imposition of those charges or the services provided, and the creditor does not retain the \ncharges. Id. Examples of finance charges include, among other things, interest, points, service or carrying charges, \ncredit report fees, and credit insurance premiums. Id.\n\nThe finance charge is significant for two reasons. First, it is meant to represent, in dollar terms, the \"cost of credit\" in \nwhatever form imposed by the creditor or paid by the borrower. Second, the finance charge is used in calculating \nthe annual percentage rate (APR) for the loan, 15 U.S.C. 1606, which represents the \"cost of credit, expressed as a \nyearly rate.\" \u00a7 226.22(a)(1). Together, these two interrelated terms are among the most important terms disclosed \nto consumers under TILA.\n\nWhile the test for determining what is included in a finance charge is very broad, TILA Section 106 excludes from \nthe definition of the finance charge various fees or charges. The statute excludes from the finance charge: \nPremiums for credit insurance if coverage is not required to obtain credit, certain disclosures are provided to the \nconsumer, and the consumer affirmatively requests the insurance in writing; and premiums for property and liability \ninsurance written in connection with a consumer credit transaction if the insurance may be obtained from a person \nof the consumer's choice and certain disclosures are provided to the consumer. 15 U.S.C. 1605(b) and (c). \nStatutory exclusions also apply to certain security interest charges, including: (1) Fees or charges required by law \nand paid to public officials for determining the existence of, or for perfecting, releasing, or satisfying, any security \nrelated to the credit transaction; (2) premiums for insurance purchased instead of perfecting any security interest \notherwise required by the creditor; and (3) taxes levied on security instruments or the documents evidencing \nindebtedness if payment of those taxes is required to record the instrument securing the evidence of indebtedness. \n15 U.S.C. 1605(d). Finally, the statute excludes from the finance charge various fees in connection with loans \nsecured by real property, such as title examination fees, title insurance premiums, fees for preparation of loan-\nrelated documents, escrows for future payment of taxes and insurance, notary fees, appraisal fees, pest and flood-\nhazard inspection fees, and credit report fees. 15 U.S.C. 1605(e).\n\n\n\nThrough the exclusions described above, the Congress has adopted a \"some fees in, some fees out\" approach to \nthe finance charge with some fees automatically excluded from the finance charge and other fees excluded from \nthe finance charge provided certain conditions are met. The regulation tracks this approach with a three-tiered \napproach to the classification of fees or charges: (1) Some fees or charges are finance charges; (2) some fees and \ncharges are not finance charges; and (3) some fees and charges are not finance charges, but only if certain \nconditions are met. As a result, neither the finance charge nor the corresponding APR disclosed to the consumer \nreflect the consumer's total cost of credit.\n\nSection 226.4(a) defines the finance charge as \"the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount.\" Consistent with \nTILA Section 106(a), the finance charge includes \"any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and \nimposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit\" and does not \ninclude \"any charge of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.\" \u00a7 226.4(a). The finance charge also \nincludes fees and amounts charged by someone other than the creditor if the creditor requires the use of a third \nparty as a condition of or incident to the extension of credit, even if the consumer can choose the third party, or if \nthe creditor retains a portion of the third party charge (to the extent of the portion retained). \u00a7 226.4(a)(1).\n\nThe Board has adopted provisions in the regulation to give effect to each of the statutory exclusions and conditional \nexclusions from the finance charge. Closing agent charges are not included in the finance charge unless the \ncreditor requires the particular services for which the consumer is charged, requires imposition of the charge, or \nretains a portion of the charge (to the extent of the portion retained). \u00a7 226.4(a)(2). Premiums for credit insurance \nmay be excluded from the finance charge if insurance coverage is not required by the creditor, certain disclosures \nare provided to the consumer, and the consumer affirmatively requests the insurance coverage in a writing signed \nor initialed by the consumer. \u00a7 226.4(d)(1). Premiums for property and liability insurance may also be excluded from \nthe finance charge if the insurance may be obtained from a person of the consumer's choice and certain \ndisclosures are provided to the consumer. \u00a7 226.4(d)(2). Certain security interest charges enumerated in the \nstatute, such as taxes and fees prescribed by law and paid to public officials for determining the existence of, or for \nperfecting, releasing, or satisfying, a security interest, are excluded from the finance charge. \u00a7 226.4(e). The \nregulation also excludes from the finance charge the real estate related fees enumerated in Section 106(e) of TILA. \n\u00a7 226.4(c)(7).\n\nOver time, the Board, by regulation, has contributed to the \"some fees in, some fees out\" approach to the finance \ncharge by determining that certain other charges not specifically excluded by the statute are not finance charges. \nThese regulatory exclusions often sought to bring logical consistency to the treatment of fees that are similar to fees \nthe statute excludes or conditionally excludes from the finance charge. Charges excluded from the finance charge \nby regulation include: Charges for debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage if the coverage is not required by \nthe creditor, certain disclosures are provided to the consumer, and the consumer affirmatively requests the \ncoverage in a writing signed or initialed by the consumer; and fees for verifying the information in a credit report. \nSee \u00a7 226.4(d)(3) and comment 4(c)(7)-1. The additional fees the Board has excluded from the finance charge \ngenerally are closely analogous or related to fees that the statute excludes or conditionally excludes from the \nfinance charge. For example, premiums for voluntary debt cancellation coverage are closely analogous to \npremiums for voluntary credit insurance, which TILA excludes from the finance charge. Likewise, charges for \nverifying a credit report are related to the credit report itself.\n\nConcerns With the Current Approach to Finance Charges\n\nThe \"some fees in, some fees out\" approach to the finance charge has been problematic both for consumers and \nfor creditors since TILA's inception. Many of these problems were described in the 1998 Joint Report. 20\n\n20 The1998 Joint Report at 8-16.\n\n \n\n\n\nOne fundamental problem is that there are two views of what is meant by the \"cost of credit.\" From the creditor's \nperspective, the cost of credit means the interest and fee income that the creditor receives or requires in exchange \nfor providing credit to the consumer. From the consumer's perspective, however, the cost of credit means what the \nconsumer pays for the credit, regardless of the persons to whom such amounts are paid. 21 The statute uses both \nof these approaches in designating which fees are and are not included in the finance charge.\n\nThe influence of the creditor's perspective on the cost of credit is evident in how the \"some fees in, some fees out\" \napproach to the finance charge has evolved and been applied to loans secured by real property. Many services \nprovided in connection with real estate loans are performed by third parties, such as appraisers, closing agents, \ninspectors, public officials, attorneys, and title companies. Some of these services are required by the creditor, \nwhile others are not. In either case, the fees for these services generally are remitted in whole or in part to the third \nparty. In some cases, the creditor may have little control over the fees imposed by these third parties. From the \ncreditor's perspective, the creditor generally does not receive and retain these charges in connection with providing \ncredit to the consumer. From the consumer's perspective, however, these third-party charges are part of what the \nconsumer pays to obtain credit. 22\n\nAnother problem with the \"some fees in, some fees out\" approach is that it undermines the effectiveness of the APR \nas an accurate measure of the cost of credit expressed as a yearly rate. The APR is designed to be a benchmark \nfor consumer shopping. In consumer testing conducted for the Board, however, the APR appeared not to be \nfulfilling that objective in connection with mortgage loans.\n\nA single figure such as the APR is simple to use, particularly if consumers can use it to evaluate and compare \ncompeting products, rather than having to evaluate multiple figures. 23 This is especially true for a figure such as \nthe APR, which has a forty-year history in consumer disclosures, and thus is familiar to consumers. Nevertheless, if \nthat single figure is not understood by consumers or does not fully represent what it purports to represent, the \nusefulness of that figure is undermined. Consumer testing shows that most consumers do not understand the APR, \nand many believe that the APR is the interest rate.\n\n \n\n21 See The 1998 Joint Report at 10.\n\n \n\n \n\n22 See The 1998 Joint Report at 11.\n\n \n\n \n\n23 See The 1998 Joint Report at 9.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUnder the current \"some fees in, some fees out\" approach to the finance charge, mortgage lenders also have an \nincentive to unbundle the cost of credit and shift some of the costs from the interest rate into ancillary fees that are \nexcluded from the finance charge and not considered when calculating the APR, resulting in a lower APR than \notherwise would have been disclosed. This further undermines the usefulness of the APR and has resulted in the \nproliferation of \"junk fees,\" such as fees for preparing loan-related documents. Such unbundling of the cost of credit, \nand the resulting pricing complexity, can have a detrimental impact on consumers. For example, research \nundertaken by HUD suggests that borrowers experience great difficulty when deciding whether the tradeoff \nbetween paying higher up-front costs or paying a higher interest rate is in their best interest, and that borrowers \nwho do not pay up-front loan origination fees generally pay less than borrowers who do pay such fees. 24 To the \nextent that the APR calculation includes most or all fees, the APR can reduce the incentive for lenders to include \njunk fees in credit agreements. 25\n\nBased on extensive outreach conducted by Board staff, there appears to be a broad consensus that the \"some fees \nin, some fees out\" approach to the finance charge and corresponding APR calculation and disclosure is seriously \nflawed. Many industry representatives consider the finance charge definition overly complex. For creditors, this \ncomplexity creates significant regulatory burden and litigation risk. While some industry representatives generally \nfavor a more inclusive measure, they have not advocated a specific test for determining the finance charge.\n\nConsumer advocates believe that the exclusions from the finance charge undermine the purpose of the finance \ncharge and the APR, which is to measure the cost of credit. Some consumer advocates have recommended a \"but \nfor\" test that would include in the finance charge all fees except those that the consumer would pay if he or she \nwere not \"obtaining, accessing, or repaying the extension of credit,\" such as fees paid in comparable cash \ntransactions. 26\n\nIn the 1998 Joint Report, the Board and HUD recommended that the Congress adopt a more comprehensive \ndefinition of the finance charge. 27 The Board and HUD recommended adopting a \"required-cost of credit\" test that \nwould include in the finance charge \"the costs the consumer is required to pay to get the credit.\" 28 Under this \napproach, the finance charge would include (and the APR would reflect) costs required to be paid by the consumer \nto obtain the credit, including many fees currently excluded from the finance charge, such as application fees, \nappraisal fees, document preparation fees, fees for title services, and fees paid to public officials to record security \n\n24 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,A Study of Closing Costs for FHA Mortgages at x-xi and 2-4 (May 2008).\n\n25 See The 1998 Joint Report at 9.\n\n \n\n \n\n26 Renuart, Elizabeth and Diane E.

The Board believes consumers would benefit \nfrom having a disclosure that includes fees or charges that better represent the full cost of credit undiluted by \nmyriad exclusions, the basis for which consumers cannot be expected to understand. In addition, having a single \nbenchmark figure--the APR--that is simple to use should allow consumers to evaluate competing mortgage \nproducts by reviewing one variable. The Board also believes that such a disclosure would reduce compliance \nburdens, regulatory uncertainty, and litigation risks for creditors who must provide accurate TILA disclosures.\n\nThus, the Board would retain the APR as a benchmark for closed-end transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling but is proposing certain revisions designed to make the APR more useful to consumers. First, as \ndiscussed below, the Board is proposing to provide consumers with more helpful explanation of the APR and what it \nrepresents. Second, the Board is proposing to require disclosure of the APR together with a new disclosure of the \ninterest rate, as discussed below. Third, the Board is proposing to replace the \"some fees in, some fees out\" \napproach for determining the finance charge with a simpler, more inclusive approach for determining the finance \ncharge that is based on TILA Section 106(a), 15 U.S.C. 1605(a). This approach is designed to ensure that the \nfinance charge and the corresponding APR disclosed to consumers fulfills the basic purpose of TILA by providing a \nmore complete and useful measure of the cost of credit.\n\nPursuant to its authority under TILA Sections 105(a) and (f) of TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1604(a) and (f), the Board is \nproposing to amend \u00a7 226.4 to make most of the current exclusions from the finance charge inapplicable to closed-\nend credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. For such loans, the Board is proposing to replace the \n\"some fees in, some fees out\" approach with a simpler, more inclusive test based on the definition of finance charge \nin TILA Section 106(a), 15 U.S.C. 1605(a), for determining what fees or charges are included in the finance charge. \nThe Board believes that the current patchwork of fee exclusions from the definition of the finance charge is not \nconsistent with TILA's purpose of disclosing the cost of credit to the consumer. The Board believes that a more \ninclusive approach to determining the finance charge would be more consistent with TILA's purpose, enhance \nconsumer understanding and use of the finance charge and APR disclosures, and reduce compliance costs. The \nBoard also believes that the proposed revisions to the finance charge may enhance competition for third-party \nservices since creditors would likely be more mindful of fees or charges that must be included in the finance charge \nand APR.\n\nThe proposed test for determining the finance charge tracks the language of current \u00a7 226.4 but excluding \u00a7 \n226.4(a)(2). Specifically, under this test, a fee or charge is included in the finance charge for closed-end credit \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling if it is (1) \"payable directly or indirectly by the consumer\" to \nwhom credit is extended, and (2) \"imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the \nextension of credit.\" The finance charge would continue to exclude fees or charges paid in comparable cash \ntransactions. See \u00a7 226.4(a). The finance charge also includes charges by third parties if the creditor: (1) Requires \nuse of a third party as a condition of or incident to the extension of credit, even if the consumer can choose the third \nparty; or (2) retains a portion of the third-party charge, to the extent of the portion retained. See \u00a7 226.4(a)(1). Other \n\n29 The1998 Joint Report at 13.\n\n30 The1998 Joint Report at 13.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nexclusions from the finance charge for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling would \nbe limited to late fees and similar default or delinquency charges, seller's points, and premiums for property and \nliability insurance.\n\nAs new services are added, and new fees are charged, in connection with closed-end credit transactions secured \nby real property or a dwelling, creditors would have to apply the basic test in making judgments about whether or \nnot new fees must be included in the finance charge. The Board requests comment on whether further guidance is \nneeded to assist creditors in making these determinations, and, if so, what specific guidance would be helpful.\n\nLoans covered. Section 226.4 is part of Subpart A, General, as opposed to Subpart C, Closed-End Credit. \nNevertheless, the proposed amendments to \u00a7 226.4 would apply only to closed-end credit transactions secured by \nreal property or a dwelling, consistent with the general scope of this proposed rule. The Board seeks comment on \nwhether the same amendments should be made applicable to other closed-end credit and may consider such \namendments under a future review of Regulation Z. Contemporaneous with this proposal, the Board is publishing \nseparately proposed rules regarding home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Accordingly, the Board is not proposing \nto apply the changes to the finance charge determination to HELOCs in this rulemaking. As discussed in the \nHELOC proposal, the Board believes that changing the definition of finance charge for HELOC accounts would not \nhave a material effect on the HELOC disclosures and accordingly is unnecessary.\n\nImpact on coverage of other rules. One potential consequence of adopting a more inclusive test for determining the \nfinance charge is that more loans may qualify as \"HOEPA loans,\" as described in TILA Section 103(aa), and \ntherefore be subject to the additional disclosures and prohibitions applicable to such loans under TILA Section 129. \nSimilarly, more loans may be subject to the Board's recently adopted protections for higher-priced mortgage loans \nunder \u00a7 226.35, which become effective on October 1, 2009. 73 FR 44522; Jul. 30, 2008. Finally, more loans may \nqualify as covered loans under certain State anti-predatory lending laws that use the APR as a coverage test. The \nBoard has conducted some analysis to quantify these impacts.\n\nTo estimate representative charges, the Board obtained information from a 2008 survey conducted by \nBankrate.com on closing costs for each state, based on a $ 200,000 hypothetical mortgage loan. 31 Using these \nestimates, and scaling those that are calculated as a percentage of loan amount as necessary, the Board estimated \nthe effect on the APRs of first-lien loans in two databases: HMDA records, which include most closed-end home \nloans, and data obtained from Lender Processing Services, Inc. (LPS), which include mostly prime and near-prime \nhome loans serviced by several large mortgage servicers.\n\nOn the basis of this analysis, the Board estimates that proposed \u00a7 226.4 would increase the share of first-lien \nrefinance and home improvement loans covered by HOEPA, under \u00a7 226.32, by about 0.6 percent. While this \nincrease is small, the Board also notes that, because very few HOEPA loans are originated overall, the absolute \nnumber of loans covered would increase markedly--more than 350 percent. Because the HMDA data do not include \nAPRs for loans below the rate spread reporting thresholds, see 12 CFR 203.4(a)(12), 2006 LPS data were used to \nestimate the impact on coverage of \u00a7 226.35. Based on this analysis, the Board estimates that about 3 percent of \nthe first-lien loans in the loan amount range of the typical home purchase or refinance loan ($ 175,000 to $ 225,000) \n\n31 To supplement the Bankrate.com survey with estimated recording fees and taxes, which the survey did not include, the Board \nused the Martindale-Hubbell service's digest of State laws. As discussed below, the Board is not proposing to revise comment \n4(a)--5, which provides principles for determining the treatment of taxes based on the party on whom the law imposes the tax. \nFor the sake of simplicity, the Board did not attempt to distinguish such laws on this basis and, instead, included all recording \ntaxes in thefinance charge under the proposal. The analysis thus may have included some recording taxes in the finance charge \nunder the proposal that could have been excluded under comment 4(a)-5.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nthat were below the \u00a7 226.35 APR threshold would have been above the threshold if proposed \u00a7 226.4 had been in \neffect at the time.\n\nThe Board also examined HMDA data for the impact of the proposed, more inclusive finance charge definition on \nAPRs in certain states. Specifically, the Board considered the APR tests for coverage of first-lien mortgages under \nthe anti-predatory lending laws in the District of Columbia (DC), Illinois, and Maryland. These laws are the only \nthree State anti-predatory lending laws with APR coverage thresholds that are lower than the federal HOEPA APR \nthreshold, for first-lien loans, of 800 basis points over the U.S. Treasury yield on securities with comparable \nmaturities. DC and Illinois use a threshold of 600 basis points, and Maryland uses a threshold of 700 basis points, \nover the comparable Treasury yield. 32 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have policies under which they will not \npurchase loans that exceed the Illinois thresholds, 33 but they have no such policies with regard to DC or Maryland. \nThe Board estimates that proposed \u00a7 226.4 would convert the following percentages of first-lien loans that are \nunder the applicable APR threshold into loans that exceed that threshold and thus would become covered by the \napplicable State anti-predatory lending law: DC, 2.5%; Illinois, 4.0%; Maryland, 0.0%.\n\nThe Board notes that the impact of the proposed finance charge definition on APRs varies among loans based on \ntwo significant factors. First, because many of the affected charges are fixed dollar amounts, the impact is \nsignificantly greater for smaller loans. Second, the impact likely would vary geographically because some charges, \nnotably title insurance premiums and recording fees and taxes, vary considerably by state. The Board believes the \nproposal, on balance, would be in consumers' interests but seeks comment on these consequences of the proposal \nand the impact it may have on loans that could become subject to these various laws.\n\nLegal authority. The Board is proposing to adopt the simpler, more inclusive test for determining the finance charge \nand corresponding APR pursuant to its general rulemaking, exception, and exemption authorities under TILA \nSection 105. Section 105(a) directs the Board to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this title, which \ninclude facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of \ncredit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Section 105(a) generally authorizes the Board to make adjustments and \nexceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, to prevent circumvention or evasion of the statute, or to \nfacilitate compliance with the statute. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a).\n\nThe Board has considered the purposes for which it may exercise its authority under TILA Section 105(a) carefully \nand, based on that review, believes that the proposed adjustments and exceptions are appropriate. The proposal \nhas the potential to effectuate the statute's purpose by better informing consumers of the total cost of credit and to \nprevent circumvention or evasion of the statute through the unbundling or shifting of the cost of credit from finance \ncharges to fees or charges that are currently excluded from the finance charge. The Board believes that Congress \ndid not anticipate how such unbundling would undermine the purposes of TILA, when it enacted the exceptions. For \nexample, fees for preparation of loan-related documents are excluded from the finance charge by TILA Section \n106(e), 15 U.S.C. 1605(e); in practice, document preparation fees have become a common vehicle used by \ncreditors to enhance their revenue without having any impact on the finance charge or APR. A simpler, more \ninclusive approach to determining the finance charge also would facilitate compliance with the statute.\n\nTILA Section 105(f) generally authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions from coverage under any \npart of TILA if the Board determines that coverage under that part does not provide a meaningful benefit to \n\n32 DC Code Ann. 26-1151.01(7)(A)(i); Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 815, 137/10; Md. Code Ann. Com. Law 12-1029(a)(2).\n\n33 http://www.freddiemac.com/learn/pdfs/uw/Pred_requirements.pdf; \n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.freddiemac.com/learn/pdfs/uw/Pred_requirements.pdf\n\nconsumers in the form of useful information or protection. 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). The Board is proposing to exempt \nclosed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling from the complex exclusions in TILA Section 106(b) \nthrough (e), 15 U.S.C. 1605(b) through (e). TILA Section 105(f) directs the Board to make the determination of \nwhether coverage of such transactions under those exclusions provides a meaningful benefit to consumers in light \nof specific factors. 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2). These factors are (1) the amount of the loan and whether the disclosure \nprovides a benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction involving a loan of such amount; (2) the extent to \nwhich the requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more expensive the credit process; (3) the status of the \nborrower, including any related financial arrangements of the borrower, the financial sophistication of the borrower \nrelative to the type of transaction, and the importance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and \ncoverage under TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the borrower; and (5) whether \nthe exemption would undermine the goal of consumer protection.\n\nThe Board has considered each of these factors carefully and, based on that review, believes that the proposed \nexemptions are appropriate. Mortgage loans generally are the largest credit obligation that most consumers \nassume. Most of these loans are secured by the consumer's principal residence. For many consumers, their \nmortgage loan is the most important credit obligation that they have. Consumer testing suggests that consumers \nfind the finance charge and APR disclosures confusing and unhelpful when shopping for a mortgage. Along with \nother changes, replacing the patchwork \"some fees in, some fees out\" approach to determining the finance charge \nwith a more inclusive approach that reflects the consumer's total cost of credit has the potential to further the goals \nof consumer protection and promote the informed use of credit for mortgage loans. Adoption of a more inclusive \nfinance charge also would simplify compliance, reduce regulatory burden, and reduce litigation risk for creditors.\n\nThe Board's exception and exemption authority under Sections 105(a) and (f) does not apply in the case of a \nmortgage referred to in Section 103(aa), which are high-cost mortgages generally referred to as \"HOEPA loans.\" \nThe Board does not believe that this limitation restricts its ability to apply the revised provisions regarding finance \ncharges to all mortgage loans, including HOEPA loans. This limitation on the Board's general exception and \nexemption authority is a necessary corollary to the decision of the Congress, as reflected in TILA Section 129(l)(1), \nto grant the Board more limited authority to exempt HOEPA loans from the prohibitions applicable only to HOEPA \nloans in Section 129(c) through (i) of TILA. See 15 U.S.C. 1639(l)(1). Here, the Board is not proposing any \nexemptions from the HOEPA prohibitions. This limitation does raise a question as to whether the Board could use \nits exception and exemption authority under Sections 105(a) and (f) to except or exempt HOEPA loans, but not \nother types of mortgage loans, from other, generally applicable TILA provisions. That question, however, is not \nimplicated by this proposal.\n\nHere, the Board is proposing to apply its general exception and exemption authority to enhance the finance charge \ndisclosure for all loans secured by real property or a dwelling, including both HOEPA and non-HOEPA loans, in \norder to fulfill the statute's purpose of having the finance charge and APR disclosures reflect the total cost of credit. \nIt would not be consistent with the statute or with Congressional intent to interpret the Board's authority under \nSections 105(a) and (f) in such a way that the proposed revisions could apply only to mortgage loans that are not \nsubject to HOEPA. Reading the statute in a way that would deprive HOEPA borrowers of improved finance charge \nand APR disclosures is not a reasonable construction of the statute and contravenes the Congress's goal of \nensuring \"that enhanced protections are provided to consumers who are most vulnerable to abuse.\" n34\n\nThe Board solicits comment on all aspects of this proposal, including the cost, burden, and benefits to consumers \nand to industry regarding the proposed revisions to the determination of the finance charge. The Board also \nrequests comment on any alternatives to the proposal that would further the purposes of TILA and provide \nconsumers with more useful disclosures.\n\n4(a) Definition\n\nComment 4(a)--5 contains guidance for determining whether taxes should be treated as finance charges. Generally, \na tax imposed on the creditor is a finance charge if the creditor passes it through to the consumer. If applicable law \n\n\n\nimposes a tax solely on the consumer, on the creditor and consumer jointly, on the credit transaction itself without \nspecifying a liable party, or on the creditor with direction or authorization to pass it through to the consumer, the tax \nis not a finance charge.\n\nConsequently, an examination of the law imposing each tax that is paid by the consumer is required to determine \nwhether such taxes are finance charges. This examination of laws creates burden for creditors and may result in \ninconsistent treatment of similar taxes. The resulting disclosures likely are not as useful to consumers as they might \nbe if all taxes were treated consistently. The Board seeks comment on whether the rules for determining the finance \ncharge treatment of taxes imposed by State and local governments should be simplified and, if so, how. The Board \nalso seeks comment on whether any such simplification should be for purposes of closed-end transactions secured \nby real property or a dwelling only or should have more general applicability.\n\nProposed new comment 4(a)--6 would clarify that there is no comparable cash transaction in a transaction where \nthere is no seller, such as a refinancing, and thus the comparable cash transaction exclusion from the finance \ncharge does not apply to such transactions.\n\n4(a)(2) Special Rule; Closing Agent Charges\n\nThe Board is proposing to amend \u00a7 226.4(a)(2), which set out special rules for closing agent charges, in light of the \nproposed new \u00a7 226.4(g), discussed below. As a result, this provision would no longer apply to closed-end credit \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling because the fees excluded by \u00a7 226.4(a)(2) meet the general \ndefinition of the finance charge in TILA Section 106(a). The Board also proposes certain conforming amendments \nto the staff commentary under this provision.\n\nUnder the general definition of \"finance charge\" in TILA Section 106(a), a charge is a finance charge if it is (1) \n\"payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended,\" and (2) \"imposed directly or indirectly \nby the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.\" 15 U.S.C. 1605(a). Application of the basic statutory \ndefinition as the test for determining which charges are finance charges would result in many third-party charges \nbeing treated as finance charges because such third-party charges often are payable directly or indirectly by the \nconsumer and imposed indirectly by the creditor. For instance, because real estate settlements are complex \nfinancial and legal transactions, creditors generally require a licensed closing agent (often an attorney) to conduct \nclosings to ensure that the transaction is handled with professional skill and care. These closing agents typically \nimpose fees on the consumer in the course of ensuring that the loan is consummated appropriately. In some cases, \nthe creditor clearly requires the particular third-party service for which a fee is charged, such as where the creditor \ninstructs the closing agent to send documents by overnight courier. In other cases, however, whether the creditor \nrequires the particular service is not clear.\n\nA rule that requires case-by-case factual determinations as to whether a particular third-party fee must be included \nin the finance charge results in complexity and inconsistent treatment of such fees. Such inconsistent treatment in \nturn undermines the utility of the finance charge and APR as comparison shopping tools and introduces uncertainty \nand litigation risk for creditors. For these reasons, the Board believes that fees charged by closing agents, both their \nown and those of other third parties they hire to perform particular services, should be treated uniformly as finance \ncharges. The Board seeks comment on whether any such third-party charges do not fall within the basic test for \ndetermining the finance charge and could be excluded from the finance charge without requiring factual \ndetermination in each case.\n\nRequiring third-party charges to be included in the finance charge creates some risk that a creditor may understate \nthe finance charge if the creditor does not know that a particular charge was imposed by a third party. This risk is \nmitigated to some extent by TILA Section 106(f), which provides that a disclosed finance charge is treated as \naccurate if it does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than $ 100 or is greater than the amount \nrequired to be disclosed. 15 U.S.C. 1605(f). This tolerance has been incorporated into Regulation Z. See \u00a7 \n226.18(d)(1). The Board requests comment on whether it should increase the finance charge tolerance, for example \nto $ 200, in light of its proposal to require more third-party charges to be included in the finance charge. The Board \n\n\n\nalso requests comment on whether the existing or any increased tolerance should be linked to an inflation index, \nsuch as the Consumer Price Index.\n\nExcluding fees from the finance charge because they are voluntary or optional also is not consistent with the \nstatutory purpose of disclosing the \"cost of credit,\" which includes charges imposed \"as an incident to the extension \nof credit.\" 35 15 U.S.C. 1605(a). One basis for the current exclusions for voluntary or optional charges is an implicit \nassumption that they are not \"imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor\" on the consumer. However, charges \nmay be imposed by a creditor even if the services for which the fee is imposed are not specifically required by the \ncreditor. Moreover, a test that depends upon whether a service is \"voluntary\" inherently requires a factual \ndetermination. In the current provisions addressing credit insurance, the Board has identified certain objective \ncriteria for determining when the consumer's purchase of such insurance is deemed to be voluntary. However, as \ndiscussed below, this approach has many problems and has not proven satisfactory. The Board believes that \ndrawing a bright-line to include in the finance charge both voluntary and required charges that are imposed by the \ncreditor would eliminate the difficulties posed by this type of fact-based analysis and provide a more consistent \nmeasure of the cost of credit.\n\nAnother basis for the current exclusions for voluntary or optional charges in connection with the credit transaction is \nan assumption that creditors cannot know the amounts of such charges at the time the disclosure must be provided \nto the consumer. The Board presumes that creditors know the amounts of their own voluntary charges, if any. The \nBoard believes that creditors generally know or can readily determine voluntary third-party charges when providing \nTILA disclosures three business days before consummation, as proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) would require. As a \npractical matter, the primary voluntary third-party charge in connection with a mortgage transaction of which the \nBoard is aware (and that is not otherwise excluded from the finance charge) is the premium for voluntary credit \ninsurance, and creditors generally solicit consumers for such insurance. In fact, under existing \u00a7 226.4(d)(1)(ii), \ncreditors historically have had to disclose the premium for voluntary credit insurance to exclude it from the finance \ncharge. The Board nevertheless solicits comment on whether there are voluntary third-party charges the amounts \nof which cannot be determined three business days before consummation.\n\nThe Board recognizes that creditors may not know what voluntary or optional charges the consumer will incur when \nproviding early TILA disclosures. When providing early TILA disclosures, creditors may rely on reasonable \nassumptions regarding voluntary or optional charges and label those amounts as estimates. The Board invites \ncomment on whether further guidance is required regarding reasonable assumptions that may be made regarding \nvoluntary or optional charges in early TILA disclosures.\n\n4(b) Examples of Finance Charges\n\nThe Board is proposing technical amendments to comment 4(b)--1 to reflect the fact that the exclusions from the \nfinance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c) through (e), other than \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(c)(2), 226.4(c)(5) and 226.4(d)(2), would not apply \nto closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n4(c) Charges Excluded From the Finance Charge\n\n35 The Board has consistently interpreted the definition offinance charge as not dependent on whether a charge is voluntary or \nrequired. As a practical matter, most voluntary fees are excluded because they coincidentally are payable in a comparable cash \ntransaction, not specifically because they are voluntary. See, e.g., 61 FR 49237, 49239; Sept. 19, 1996 (charges for voluntary \ndebt cancellation agreements).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Board proposes to amend \u00a7 226.4(c), which lists miscellaneous exclusions from the finance charge, to provide \nthat \u00a7 226.4(c) is limited by proposed new \u00a7 226.4(g). Thus, except for late fees and similar default or delinquency \ncharges and seller's points, the exclusions in \u00a7 226.4(c) would not apply to closed-end credit transactions secured \nby real property or a dwelling. The Board also proposes certain conforming amendments to the staff commentary \nunder those provisions.\n\n4(c)(2)\n\nThe exclusion of fees for actual unanticipated late payment, exceeding a credit limit, or for delinquency, default, or a \nsimilar occurrence in \u00a7 226.4(c)(2) would be retained for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or \na dwelling. The Board believes these charges should be excluded because they necessarily occur only after the \nfinance charge is disclosed to consumers. At the time the TILA disclosures must be provided to consumers, a \ncreditor cannot know whether it will impose such charges or their amounts.\n\n4(c)(5)\n\nThe exclusion of seller's points from the finance charge in \u00a7 226.4(c)(5) would be retained for closed-end credit \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Seller's points are not payable by the consumer. Comment \n226.4(c)(5)--1 notes that seller's points may be passed on to the buyer in the form of a higher sales price for the \nproperty or dwelling. Even then, seller's points are excluded from the finance charge. A different rule would require \na fact-specific determination in every transaction involving seller's points regarding whether and to what extent the \nseller shifted those costs to the borrower. The Board does not believe that such a rule is feasible. The Board seeks \ncomment on the retention of the seller's points exclusion.\n\n4(c)(7) Real-Estate Related Fees\n\nThe Board is proposing to amend \u00a7 226.4(c)(7), which currently excludes from the finance charge a number of fees \ncharged in transactions secured by real property or in residential mortgage transactions if those fees are bona fide \nand reasonable. Under the proposal, the following fees currently excluded would be included in the finance charge \nfor closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling: fees for title examination, abstract of title, \ntitle insurance, property survey, and similar purposes; fees for preparing loan-related documents, such as deeds, \nmortgages, and reconveyance or settlement documents; notary and credit-report fees; property appraisal fees or \nfees for inspections to assess the value or condition of the property if the service is performed prior to closing, \nincluding fees related to pest-infestation or flood-hazard determinations; and amounts required to be paid into \nescrow or trustee accounts if the amounts would not otherwise be included in the finance charge. The commentary \nprovisions under \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) would also be amended accordingly.\n\nAs amended, \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) and the commentary provisions under \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) would apply only to open-end credit \nplans secured by real property and open-end residential mortgage transactions. Thus, for HELOCs, the fees \nspecified in \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) would continue to be excluded from the finance charge. The Board requests comment on \nwhether it should retain \u00a7 226.4(c)(7), as proposed to be amended, or delete \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) altogether, in light of the \nproposed changes to the Regulation Z HELOC rules, published today in a separate Federal Register notice. See \nthe discussion under \u00a7 226.4 in that notice.\n\n4(d) Insurance and Debt Cancellation and Debt Suspension Coverage\n\nThe Board is proposing technical amendments to comment 4(d)--12 to reflect the fact that the exclusions from the \nfinance charge under \u00a7 226.4(e) would not apply to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n4(d)(1) and (3) Voluntary Credit Insurance Premiums; Voluntary Debt Cancellation and Debt Suspension Fees\n\n\n\nThe Board is proposing to amend \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1), exclusion for voluntary credit insurance premiums, and \n226.4(d)(3), exclusion for voluntary debt cancellation and debt suspension fees, to limit their application consistently \nwith proposed \u00a7 226.4(g). Thus, these exclusions would not apply to closed-end transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling.\n\nAge or employment eligibility criteria. Under TILA Section 106(a)(5), 15 U.S.C. 1605(a)(5), a premium or other \ncharge for any guarantee or insurance protecting the creditor against the obligor's default or other credit loss is a \nfinance charge. Under \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(b)(7) and 226.4(b)(10), a premium or charge for credit life, accident, health, or loss-\nof-income insurance, or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is a finance charge if the insurance or \ncoverage is written in connection with a credit transaction. TILA Section 106(b), 15 U.S.C. 1605(b), allows the \ncreditor to exclude from the finance charge any charge or premium for credit life, accident, or health insurance \nwritten in connection with any consumer credit transaction if (1) the coverage is not a factor in the approval by the \ncreditor of the extension of credit, and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the consumer; and (2) in order to \nobtain the insurance, the consumer specifically requests the insurance after getting the disclosures. Under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.4(d)(1) and 226.4(d)(3), the creditor may exclude from the finance charge any premium for credit life, accident, \nhealth or loss-of-income insurance; any charge or premium paid for debt cancellation coverage for amounts \nexceeding the value of the collateral securing the obligation; or any charge or premium for debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension coverage in the event of loss of life, health, or income or in case of accident, whether or not the \ncoverage is insurance, if (1) the insurance or coverage is not required by the creditor and the creditor discloses this \nfact in writing; (2) the creditor discloses the premium or charge for the initial term of the insurance or coverage, (3) \nthe creditor discloses the term of insurance or coverage, if the term is less than the term of the credit transaction, \nand (4) the consumer signs or initials an affirmative written request for the insurance or coverage after receiving the \nrequired disclosures. In addition, under \u00a7 226.4(d)(3)(iii), the creditor must disclose for debt suspension coverage \nthe fact that the obligation to pay loan principal and interest is only suspended, and that interest will continue to \naccrue during the period of suspension. 36 Under proposed \u00a7 226.4(g), these provisions would not apply to closed-\nend credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\nSome creditors offer credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension products with eligibility restrictions, \nbut may not evaluate whether applicants for the products actually meet the eligibility criteria at the time the \napplicants request the product. 37 For instance, a consumer who is 70 at the time of enrollment could never receive \nthe benefits of a product with a 65-year-old age limit. 38 Similarly, a consumer who is self-employed at the time of \n\n36 The provisions regarding debtsuspension coverage were in the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule. See 74 FR 5244, 5400; \nJan. 29, 2009. These provisions will take effect on July 1, 2010.\n\n \n\n \n\n37 See, e.g., Parker et al. v. Protective Life Ins. Co. of Ohio et al., Nos. 2004-T-0127 and 2004-T-0128, 2006 Ohio App. LEXIS \n3983, at *28 (Ohio Ct. App. Aug. 4, 2006) (reversing summary judgment for defendants automobile dealership and insurer \nbecause the automobile dealership employee did not evaluate whether the plaintiffs were eligible for credit disability insurance \nand the plaintiffs were later denied benefits based on eligibility restrictions); Stewart v. Gulf Guaranty Life Ins. Co., No. 2000--\nCA--01511--SCT, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 254, at *4 (Miss. Aug. 15, 2002) (affirming the jury award where the insurer did not require \nthe bank employee to have the consumer fill out a credit life and disability insurance application regarding pre-existing conditions \nand the insurer later denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition).\n\n38 See, e.g., Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Stewart Finance Holdings, Inc. et al., Civ. Action No. 103CV--2648, Final Judgment and \nOrder at 13 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 9, 2005) (alleging that the finance company sold accidental death and dismemberment insurance to \nborrowers who were not eligible for the product due to age restrictions).\n\n\n\nenrollment would not receive benefits if the product requires the consumer to be employed as a W-2 wage \nemployee. 39\n\nAlthough age and employment eligibility criteria may be set forth in the product marketing materials and/or \nenrollment forms, the Board believes few consumers notice this information when they obtain credit and choose to \npurchase the voluntary credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage. Because the product is \nsold in connection with a credit transaction that is underwritten by the creditor, the consumer may reasonably \nbelieve that the creditor has determined that the consumer is eligible for the product. This may be especially true for \nage restrictions because that information is typically requested by the creditor on the credit application form. As a \nresult, many consumers may not discover until they file a claim that they were paying for a product for which they \nwere not eligible when they initially purchased it. Consumers that do not submit claims may never discover that they \nare paying for products that hold no value for them.\n\nTo address this problem, the Board proposes to add \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1)(iv) and 226.4(d)(3)(v) to permit creditors to \nexclude a premium or charge from the finance charge only if the creditor determines at the time of enrollment that \nthe consumer meets any applicable age or employment eligibility criteria for the credit insurance or the debt \nsuspension or debt cancellation coverage. These provisions would apply to open-end as well as closed-end (non-\nreal property) credit transactions. Proposed comment 4(d)--14 would state that a premium or charge for credit life, \naccident, health, or loss-of-income insurance, or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is voluntary and \ncan be excluded from the finance charge only if the consumer meets the product's age or employment eligibility \ncriteria at the time of enrollment. The proposed comment would further clarify that to exclude such a premium or \ncharge from the finance charge, the creditor would have to determine at the time of enrollment that the consumer is \neligible for the product under the product's age or employment eligibility restrictions.\n\nProposed comment 4(d)--14 would provide that the creditor could use reasonably reliable evidence of the \nconsumer's age or employment status to satisfy the condition. Reasonably reliable evidence of a consumer's age \nwould include using the date of birth on the consumer's credit application, on the driver's license or other \ngovernment-issued identification, or on the credit report. Reasonably reliable evidence of a consumer's employment \nstatus would include the consumer's information on a credit application, Internal Revenue Service Form W--2, tax \nreturns, payroll receipts, or other evidence such as a letter or e-mail from the consumer or the consumer's \nemployer. A determination of age or employment eligibility at the time of enrollment should not be unduly \nburdensome because in most cases the creditor would already have information about the consumer's age and \nemployment status as part of the credit underwriting process. The Board seeks comment on whether other \nexamples of reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's age or employment status should be included.\n\nProposed comment 4(d)--14 would clarify that, if the consumer does not meet the product's age or employment \neligibility criteria, then the premium or charge is not voluntary and must be included in the finance charge. If the \ncreditor offers a bundled product (such as credit life insurance combined with credit involuntary unemployment \ninsurance) and the consumer does not meet the age and/or employment eligibility criteria for all of the bundled \nproducts, the proposed commentary would clarify that the creditor must either: (1) treat the entire premium or \ncharge for the bundled product as a finance charge, or (2) offer the consumer the option of selecting only the \nproducts for which the consumer is eligible and exclude the premium or charge from the finance charge if the \n\n39 See, e.g., In the Matter of Providian Nat'l Bank, OCC Docket No. 2000-53, Consent Order (June 28, 2000) (alleging that the \nbank marketed an involuntary unemployment credit protection program but failed to adequately disclose that such protection \nwas unavailable to consumers who were self-employed).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nconsumer chooses an optional product for which the consumer meets the age and/or employment eligibility criteria \nat the time of enrollment.\n\nThe Board proposes this rule and commentary to address concerns about the voluntary nature of this product. TILA \nSection 106(b), 15 U.S.C. 1605(b), states that \"[c]harges or premiums for credit life, accident, or health insurance \nwritten in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be included in the finance charge unless (1) the \ncoverage of the debtor by the insurance is not a factor in the approval by the creditor of the extension of credit, and \nthis fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the person applying for or obtaining the extension of credit; and (2) in order \nto obtain the insurance in connection with the extension of credit, the person to whom the credit is extended must \ngive specific affirmative written indication of his desire to do so after written disclosure to him of the cost thereof.\" \nHistorically, \u00a7 226.4(d) has implemented this provision as a \"voluntariness\" standard. For example, in 1981, \ncomment 4(d)--5 was adopted as part of the TILA simplification process. The comment stated that the credit \ninsurance \"must be voluntary in order for the premium to be excluded from the finance charge.\" 46 FR 50288, \n50301; Oct. 9, 1981 (emphasis added). In 1996, the Board amended Regulation Z to apply the rules for credit \ninsurance to debt cancellation coverage. In adopting this provision, the Board stated: \"The new rule allows creditors \nto exclude fees for voluntary debt cancellation coverage from the finance charge when specified disclosures are \nmade.\" 61 FR 49237, 49240; Sept. 19, 1996 (emphasis added). In the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule, the \nBoard applied the rules for credit insurance and debt cancellation coverage to debt suspension coverage. In \nadopting this provision, the Board referred to the May 2007 Open-End Proposed Rule, which stated that the Board \n\"proposed to revise \u00a7 226.4(d)(3) to expressly permit creditors to exclude charges for voluntary debt suspension \ncoverage from the finance charge when, after receiving certain disclosures, the consumer affirmatively requests \nsuch as product.\" 74 FR 5244, 5266; Jan. 29, 2009 (emphasis in original). Finally, the model forms currently contain \nthe following statement emphasizing the voluntary nature of the product: \"Credit life insurance and credit disability \ninsurance are not required to obtain credit, and will not be provided unless you sign and agree to pay the additional \ncost.\" See Appendix H--1 (Credit Sale Model Form) and Appendix H--2 (Loan Model Form). The Board believes \nthat if the consumer was ineligible for the benefits of credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension \ncoverage at the time of enrollment, then the purchase cannot be voluntary because a reasonable consumer would \nnot knowingly purchase a policy for which he or she can derive no benefit. For these reasons, the Board believes \nthat the requirements of proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1)(iv) and 226.4(d)(3)(v) would help ensure that the purchase of \ncredit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage would, in fact, be voluntary.\n\nThe Board notes that although the proposed rule would require creditors to determine the consumer's age and/or \nemployment eligibility for the product at the time of enrollment, the proposed rule would not affect the creditor's \nability to deny coverage if the consumer misrepresented his or her age or employment status at the time of \nenrollment. Finally, the proposed rule does not require a creditor to determine if a consumer ceases to meet the age \nor employment eligibility criteria after enrollment. For example, the creditor has complied with the proposal if the \nconsumer becomes ineligible for the policy or coverage after enrollment. State or other law may address these \nissues. However, the Board solicits comment on whether creditors should be required to determine whether the \nconsumer meets the product's age or employment eligibility criteria after the product is sold (e.g., before renewing \nan annual premium), or whether creditors should be required to provide notice when the consumer exceeds the age \nlimit of the product after enrollment.\n\nRevised disclosures. As discussed above, TILA Section 106(b), 15 U.S.C. 1605(b), and \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and \n226.4(d)(3) allow a creditor to exclude from the finance charge a credit insurance premium or debt cancellation or \ndebt suspension fee if the creditor provides disclosures that inform the consumer of the voluntary nature and cost of \nthe product. Currently, Regulation Z does not specifically mandate the format of these disclosures, but provides \nsample language in the model forms. For example, Appendix H--2 (Loan Model Form) contains the following \nlanguage: \"Credit life insurance and credit disability insurance are not required to obtain credit, and will not be \nprovided unless you sign and agree to pay the additional cost.\" The model form also shows the type of product \n(e.g., credit life or credit disability); the cost of the premium; and a signature line. The signature area is \naccompanied by the following language: \"I want credit life insurance.\"\n\n\n\nConcerns have been raised about whether the current disclosures sufficiently inform consumers of the voluntary \nnature and costs of the product. To address these concerns, a disclosure was tested that included a charge for \ncredit life insurance and listed the product under the title \"Optional Features.\" Only about half of the participants \nunderstood that accepting credit insurance was voluntary and that they could decline the product. Subsequently, a \ndisclosure was tested that stated, \"STOP. You do not have to buy this insurance to get this loan.\" After reading this \ndisclosure, all participants understood the voluntary nature of the product.\n\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the product's cost. The product may be more costly than, for example, \ntraditional life insurance, but may not provide additional benefits. To address this concern, the Board tested the \nfollowing language: \"If you have insurance already, this policy may not provide you with any additional benefits. \nOther types of insurance can give you similar benefits and are often less expensive.\" Participant comprehension of \nthe costs and benefits of the product was significantly increased by these plain-language disclosures.\n\nConcerns have also been raised about eligibility restrictions. Consumers might not be aware that they may incur a \ncost for a product that provides no benefit to them if the eligibility criteria are not met at the time of enrollment. \nAccordingly, the Board tested the following language: \"Even if you pay for this insurance, you may not qualify to \nreceive any benefits in the future.\" Participants were greatly surprised to learn that they might purchase the \ninsurance only to later discover that they were not eligible for benefits. A few participants indicated that they did not \nunderstand how they could pay for the coverage and then receive no benefits. To address this issue and to \nconform to the requirements of proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1)(iv) and 226.4(d)(3)(v), the following statement was added \nto the disclosure: \"Based on our review of your age and/or employment status at this time, you would be eligible to \nreceive benefits.\" However, if there are other eligibility restrictions, such as pre-existing health conditions, the \ncreditor would be required to disclose the following statements: \"Based on our review of your age and/or \nemployment status at this time, you may be eligible to receive benefits. However, you may not qualify to receive any \nbenefits because of other eligibility restrictions.\"\n\nFinally, a sentence was added to the disclosure to refer consumers to the Board's Web site to learn more about the \nproduct, and the cost disclosure was streamlined to display more clearly the exact cost of the product. Most \nconsumer testing participants indicated they would visit the Board's Web site to learn more about a credit insurance \nor debt cancellation or debt suspension product.\n\nBased on this consumer testing, the Board proposes to add model clauses and samples that provide clearer \ninformation to consumers about the voluntary nature and costs of credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension coverage. These model clauses and samples would apply in open-end or closed-end (not secured by \nreal property) transactions, if the product is voluntary and the consumer qualifies for benefits based on age or \nemployment. For closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, the model clause or sample would \nbe required whether or not the product is voluntary. Model Clauses and Samples are proposed at Appendix G--\n16(C) and G--16(D) and H--17(C) and H--17(D). These Model Clauses and Samples would be in addition to the \nDebt Suspension Model Clauses and Samples found at Appendix G--16(A) and G--16(B) and H--17(A) and H--\n17(B).\n\nTiming of disclosures. Currently, comment 4(d)--2 states that \"[i]f disclosures are given early, for example under \u00a7 \n226.17(f) or \u00a7 226.19(a), the creditor need not redisclose if the actual premium is different at the time of \nconsummation. If insurance disclosures are not given at the time of early disclosure and insurance is in fact written \nin connection with the transaction, the disclosures under \u00a7 226.4(d) must be made in order to exclude the premiums \nfrom the finance charge.\" The Board proposes to delete the reference to \u00a7 226.19(a) to conform to the new timing \nand redisclosure requirements under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a).\n\n4(d)(2) Property Insurance Premiums\n\nThe proposal would retain the exclusion from the finance charge of premiums for insurance against loss or damage \nto property or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of property under TILA Section 106(c) and \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(2). Consumers typically purchase property and liability insurance to protect against a variety of risks, \n\n\n\nincluding loss of or damage to the property, such as damage caused by fire, loss of or damage to personal property \nkept on the property, such as furniture, and owner liability for injuries incurred by visitors to the property. Although \ncreditors generally require such insurance as a condition of extending closed-end credit secured by real property or \na dwelling in order to protect the value of the collateral that is securing the loan, consumers who do not have \nmortgages regularly purchase this type of insurance to protect themselves from the risks described above. This \ntype of insurance is best viewed as a hybrid product that protects not only the value of the creditor's collateral, but \nalso protects the consumer from loss or impairment of the consumer's equity in the property, loss or impairment of \nthe consumer's personal property, and personal liability if anyone is injured on the property. Consequently, it is \nimpossible to segregate that portion of the insurance (and that portion of the premium) which protects the creditor \nfrom that portion which protects only the consumer.\n\nIn addition, the Board has not identified significant abuses in connection with the sale or marketing of insurance \nagainst loss or damage to property or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of property. The market for \nthese products appears to be competitive. Consumers can purchase this type of insurance from many insurance \ncompanies, including companies not associated with mortgage lenders. In addition, policies generally are tailored to \nthe particular risks faced by the consumer. Thus, consumers have choices with regard to how much insurance to \npurchase to cover various risks and, as a result, have some control over the premiums they pay.\n\nThe Board requests comment on the appropriateness of retaining the current exclusion from the finance charge of \npremiums for insurance against loss or damage to property or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of \nproperty. The Board notes that, under current \u00a7 226.4(d)(2), the category of property and liability insurance has \nbeen interpreted to include coverage against flood risks; the Board seeks comment on whether the reasons for \nretaining the exclusion discussed above are applicable to flood insurance specifically and, if not, whether it should \nbe subject to separate treatment under Regulation Z. In addition, the Board requests comment on whether including \nsuch premiums in the finance charge could have adverse or unintended consequences for consumers and for \ncreditors.\n\nTILA Section 106(c) states that charges or premiums for property insurance must be included in the finance charge \nunless \"a clear and specific statement in writing is furnished by the creditor to the person to whom the credit is \nextended, setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the creditor, and stating that the person \nto whom the credit is extended may choose the person through which the insurance is to be obtained.\" 15 U.S.C. \n1605(c) (emphasis added). Section 226.4(d)(2) permits property insurance premiums to be excluded from the \nfinance charge under the following conditions, among others: \"If the coverage is obtained from or through the \ncreditor, the premium for the initial term of insurance coverage shall be disclosed. If the term of insurance is less \nthan the term of the transaction, the term of insurance shall also be disclosed.\" (Emphasis added). Comment 4(d)--\n8 states, in relevant part, that \"[t]he premium or charge must be disclosed only if the consumer elects to purchase \nthe insurance from the creditor; in such a case, the creditor must also disclose the term of the property insurance \ncoverage if it is less than the term of the obligation.\" (Emphasis added.) Currently, the comment does not use the \nstatutory language \"from or through the creditor\" and does not define the phrase. To conform to the statutory and \nregulatory language, the Board proposes to amend comment 4(d)--8 to clarify that the premium or charge and term \n(if less than the term of the obligation) must be disclosed if the consumer elects to purchase the insurance \"from or \nthrough the creditor.\" In addition, the proposed comment would clarify that insurance is available \"from or through a \ncreditor\" if it is available from the creditor's \"affiliate,\" as that term is defined under the Bank Holding Company Act, \n12 U.S.C. 1841(k). The Bank Holding Company Act defines an \"affiliate\" as \"any company that controls, is \ncontrolled by, or is under common control with another company.\" Thus, if the consumer elects to purchase \nproperty insurance from a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the creditor, then \nthe creditor would be required to disclose the cost of the insurance, and the term, if it is less than the term of the \nobligation. The Board believes that this proposed rule would clarify for creditors the meaning of \"through the \ncreditor\" and provide consumers with a clearer disclosure of the cost of property insurance.\n\n4(d)(4) Telephone Purchases\n\n\n\nUnder \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and 226.4(d)(3), creditors may exclude from the finance charge premiums for credit insurance \nor fees for debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage, if the creditor provides certain disclosures in writing and \nthe consumer signs or initials an affirmative written request for the insurance or coverage. Over the years, the \nBoard has received industry requests to permit creditors to provide the disclosures and obtain the affirmative \nconsumer request orally in order to facilitate telephone purchases of these products. In addition, the OCC has \nissued telephone sales guidelines for national banks that sell debt cancellation and debt suspension coverage. 12 \nCFR 37.6(c)(3), 37.7(b).\n\nIn the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule, the Board created an exception to the requirement to provide prior \nwritten disclosures and obtain written signatures or initials for telephone purchases of credit insurance and debt \ncancellation or debt suspension coverage in connection with open-end (not home-secured) plans. 74 FR 5244, \n5267; Jan. 29, 2009. This rule will take effect on July 1, 2010. Under new \u00a7 226.4(d)(4), for telephone purchases a \ncreditor may make the disclosures orally and the consumer may affirmatively request the insurance or coverage \norally, provided that the creditor (1) maintains evidence that the consumer, after being provided the disclosures \norally, affirmatively elected to purchase the insurance or coverage, and (2) mails the required disclosures within \nthree business days after the telephone purchase. New comment 226.4(d)(4)-1 provides that a creditor does not \nsatisfy the requirement to obtain a consumer's affirmative request if the \"request\" was a response to a leading \nquestion or negative consent. The comment also provides an example of an acceptable enrollment question (\"Do \nyou want to enroll in this optional debt cancellation plan?\").\n\nThe Board promulgated this rule pursuant to its exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105. \nSection 105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include \nfacilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit. \n15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). In addition, the Board considered the exemption factors set forth in TILA Section \n105(f)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2), and determined that an exemption for telephone purchases for open-end (not home-\nsecured) plans was appropriate because the rule contained adequate safeguards to ensure that oral purchases are \nvoluntary. 74 FR 5268. The Board emphasized that consumers in open-end (not home-secured) plans receive \nmonthly statements that clearly disclose fees, including credit insurance and debt cancellation or debt suspension \ncoverage charges. Id. Consumers who are billed for insurance or coverage they did not request can dispute the \ncharge as a billing error. Id. The Board stated that as part of the closed-end review, it would consider whether to \nexpand the telephone purchase rule to this type of credit. 74 FR 5267.\n\nThe Board believes that a telephone purchase rule for closed-end credit is not appropriate. Monthly statements are \nnot required for closed-end credit, and it would be difficult for consumers who do not receive monthly statements to \ndetect charges for unwanted coverage. Moreover, there is no billing error resolution process for closed-end loans.\n\nFinally, the Board noted in the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule that an exception or exemption for the \ntelephone purchase of credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage in connection with closed-\nend loans may be \"less necessary.\" 74 FR 5267. For open-end (not home-secured) credit, new comments 4(b)(7) \nand (8)-2 and 4(b)(10)-2 in the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule clarify that credit insurance and debt \ncancellation or debt suspension coverage is \"written in connection with a credit transaction\" if the consumer \npurchases it after the opening of an open-end (not home-secured) plan because the consumer retains the ability to \nobtain advances of funds. 74 FR 5265. Therefore, in such a transaction, the creditor must comply with the \ndisclosure and consumer request requirements even if the credit insurance and debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension coverage is sold after the opening of the plan. A creditor in an open-end (not home-secured) \ntransaction may be more likely to market the product by telephone after the opening of the plan, and new \u00a7 \n226.4(d)(4) facilitates the telephone purchase. By contrast, a creditor in a closed-end transaction is more likely to \nhave the opportunity to meet the consumer face-to-face at or before consummation to market the product, provide \nthe disclosure, and obtain the consumer request. For these reasons, this proposal does not contain a telephone \npurchase rule for credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage sold in connection with a \nclosed-end credit transaction. The Board seeks comment on this issue. For a discussion of the application of the \ntelephone purchase rule to HELOCs, see the Board's proposal for such transactions published simultaneously with \nthis proposal.\n\n\n\n4(e) Certain Security Interest Charges\n\nThe Board proposes to amend \u00a7 226.4(e), which provides exclusions from the finance charge for certain \ngovernment recording and related charges and insurance premiums incurred in lieu of such charges, as limited by \nproposed \u00a7 226.4(g). Thus, the exclusions listed in \u00a7 226.4(e) would not apply to closed-end credit transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling. The Board also proposes certain conforming amendments to the staff \ncommentary under this provision.\n\n4(g) Special Rule; Closed-End Mortgage Transactions\n\nThe Board is proposing to add a new \u00a7 226.4(g) as a special rule for closed-end credit transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. Proposed \u00a7 226.4(g) would provide that the exclusions from the finance charge enumerated \nin \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(a)(2) (closing agent charges), (c) (miscellaneous charges), (d) (premiums for certain insurance and debt \ncancellation coverage), and (e) (certain security-interest charges) do not apply to closed-end credit transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling, except that the exclusions in \u00a7 226.4(c)(2) for late, over-limit, delinquency, \ndefault, and similar fees, \u00a7 226.4(c)(5) for seller's points, and \u00a7 226.4(d)(2) for property and liability insurance would \ncontinue to apply to such transactions. As noted above, a cross-reference to the special rule in \u00a7 226.4(g) would be \nadded to each of the enumerated sections. With these changes, the following fees that currently are excluded from \nthe finance charge would be included in the finance charge for closed-end mortgage transactions (unless otherwise \nexcluded): Closing agent charges, application fees charged to all applicants for credit (whether or not credit is \nextended), voluntary credit insurance premiums, voluntary debt-cancellation charges or premiums, taxes or fees \nrequired by law and paid to public officials relating to security interests, premiums for insurance obtained in lieu of \nperfecting a security interest, taxes imposed as a condition of recording the instruments securing the evidence of \nindebtedness, and various real-estate related fees.\n\nProposed commentary to \u00a7 226.4(g) is included to clarify the rule for mortgage transactions. Proposed comment \n4(g)--1 clarifies that the commentary for the exclusions identified above no longer applies to closed-end credit \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Proposed comment 4(g)--2 clarifies that third-party charges that \nmeet the definition under \u00a7 226.4(a) and are not otherwise excluded generally are finance charges, whether or not \nthe creditor requires the services for which they are imposed. Proposed comment 4(g)--3 clarifies that charges \npayable in a comparable cash transaction, such as property taxes and fees or taxes imposed to record the deed \nevidencing transfer of title to the property from the seller to the buyer, are not finance charges because they would \nhave to be paid even if no credit were extended to finance the purchase.\n\nRequest for Comment\n\nThe Board solicits comment on the benefits and costs of the proposed changes for determining the finance charge \nfor closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The Board requests comment specifically \non whether this approach adequately or appropriately addresses the concerns raised by the \"some fees in, some \nfees out\" approach in light of the statute's purposes, the need for consumer protection and meaningful disclosures, \nand industry concerns regarding complexity and burden. The Board also seeks comment on the benefits and costs \nof the rules for insurance and related products under the proposed amendments to \u00a7 226.4(d).\n\nSection 226.17 General Disclosure Requirements\n\nThe Board is proposing new rules governing format and content of disclosures for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling under new \u00a7\u00a7 226.37 and 226.38. Accordingly, the Board proposes conforming and technical \namendments to current \u00a7\u00a7 226.17 and 226.18, as discussed more fully below. In addition, in reviewing the rules for \nclosed-end credit, regulatory text and associated commentary have been redesignated, and footnotes moved to the \ntext of the regulation or commentary, as appropriate, to facilitate compliance with the regulation.\n\n\n\n17(a) Form of Disclosures\n\n17(a)(1)\n\nThe Board proposes special rules in new \u00a7 226.37 and associated commentary to govern the format of disclosures \nrequired under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38 and 226.20(d), and existing \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c). These new format \nrules would be in addition to the rules contained in current \u00a7 226.17(a)(1). Current \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) requires that \nclosed-end credit disclosures be grouped together, segregated from everything else, and not contain any \ninformation not directly related to the disclosures. The Board proposes to revise \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) to clarify that the \ngeneral disclosure standards continue to apply to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, but under the \nproposal, creditors would also be required to meet the higher standards under proposed \u00a7 226.37. In addition, \u00a7 \n226.17(a)(1) would be revised to reflect the requirement of electronic disclosures in certain circumstances, as \ndiscussed under \u00a7 226.19(d). Under the proposal, the substance of footnotes 37 and 38 would be moved to the \nregulatory text of \u00a7 226.17(a)(1).\n\nFootnotes 37 and 38 currently provide exceptions to the grouped and segregated requirement under \u00a7 226.17(a)(1). \nFootnote 37 allows creditors to include certain information not directly related to the required disclosures, such as \nthe consumer's name, address, and account number. Footnote 38, which implements TILA Section 128(b)(1) in \npart, allows creditors to exclude certain required disclosures from the grouped and segregated requirement, such \nas the creditor's identity under \u00a7 226.18(a). 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(1). The Board proposes to revise the substance of \nfootnote 38 to require that the creditor's identity under \u00a7 226.18(a) be subject to the grouped together and \nsegregated requirement for all closed-end credit disclosures. (See proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2), which parallels this \napproach for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling). The Board proposes to make this adjustment \npursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to \nmake exceptions and adjustments to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' \nability to compare credit terms, and avoiding the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a).\n\nThe Board believes requiring the creditor's identity to be grouped together with required disclosures could assist \nconsumers. The Board believes it is important for the disclosures to bear the creditor's identity so that consumers \ncan more easily identify the appropriate entity. As a result, the Board believes the proposal would help serve TILA's \npurpose to provide meaningful disclosure of terms.\n\nCommentary to \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) provides guidance to creditors regarding the general disclosures standards \ncontained in \u00a7 226.17(a)(1). The Board proposes to clarify the applicability of comments 17(a)(1)-2, -5, -6, and -7 to \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\nCurrent comment 17(a)(1)-2 provides an exception to the grouped and segregated requirement for disclosures on \nvariable rate transactions required under existing \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c). For the reasons discussed under \nproposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2), the Board proposes to require that ARM loan program disclosures under proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(b), and ARMs adjustment notices under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c), be subject to the grouped and segregated \nrequirement. As a result, the reference made to \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c) would be removed from comment \n17(a)(1)-2.\n\nCurrent comment 17(a)(1)-5, which addresses information considered directly related to the segregated \ndisclosures, would be revised to clarify that it does not apply to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, \nand to cross-reference proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2). Under the proposal, cross-references in comments 17(a)(1)-5(viii), \n(xi), (xii), and (xvi) would be updated; no substantive change is intended. In addition, as noted below, proposed \nrevisions to \u00a7 226.18(f) regarding variable rate transactions, and proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(6) regarding assumption \ndisclosure for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, render comments 17(a)(1)-5(xiii) and (xiv) \nunnecessary and therefore those comments would be deleted. Finally, comment 17(a)(1)-5(xvi) would be revised to \nupdate cross-references.\n\n\n\nAs discussed under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.37(a)(2) and 226.38, the Board proposes to require that creditors make \ndisclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling only as applicable. Current comment 17(a)(1)-6, \nwhich permits creditors to design multi-purpose forms for closed-end credit disclosures as long as they are clear \nand conspicuous, would be revised to clarify that it does not apply to transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling, as discussed more fully below under proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2).\n\nFinally, the Board proposes to clarify in current comment 17(a)(1)-7 that transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling and that have balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics are treated as closed-end credit under \nTILA and subject to its disclosure requirements.\n\n17(a)(2)\n\nSection 226.17(a)(2), which implements TILA Section 122(a), requires the terms finance charge and annual \npercentage rate, together with a corresponding amount or percentage rate, to be more conspicuous than any other \ndisclosure, except the creditor's identity under \u00a7 226.18(a). The Board proposes new disclosure requirements under \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii) for the finance charge (renamed \"interest and settlement charges\"), and under proposed \n\u00a7\u00a7 226.37(a)(2) and 226.38(b) for the APR. As a result, the Board would revise \u00a7 226.17(a)(2) to be inapplicable to \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n17(b) Time of Disclosures\n\nSection 227.17(b) and comment 17(b)-1 require creditors to make closed-end credit disclosures before \nconsummation of the transaction; special timing requirements apply to dwelling-secured transactions and variable-\nrate transactions. As discussed more fully under \u00a7 226.19, the Board is proposing to require creditors to make pre-\nconsummation disclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling in accordance with special timing \nrequirements. As a result, the Board proposes to revise \u00a7 226.17(b) and comment 17(b)-1 to clarify that more \nspecific timing rules would apply to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Current comment 17(b)-2, \nwhich addresses disclosure requirements for transactions converted from open-end to closed-end, would be \nrevised to clarify that the special timing requirements under \u00a7 226.19(b) would apply for adjustable rate transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n17(c) Basis of Disclosures and Use of Estimates\n\n17(c)(1) Legal Obligation\n\nSection 226.17(c)(1) requires that disclosures under subpart C reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the \nparties. Commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(1) provides guidance regarding disclosure of specific transaction types and \nloan features. The Board proposes to add new provisions in \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(i) through (vi) to move certain content \nfrom commentary to the regulation, as discussed below. In addition, the Board would revise certain commentary to \n\u00a7 226.17(c)(1) to reflect the new disclosure regime for mortgages, and redesignate comments as appropriate. Each \nof these proposed subsections, and accompanying commentary, is discussed below.\n\nComments 17(c)(1)-1 and 17(c)(1)-2 generally address disclosure of the legal obligation and modification of such \nobligation. Comment 17(c)(1)-1 would be revised to include the general principle that the consumer is presumed to \nabide by the terms of the legal obligation. For example, proposed comment 17(c)(1)-1 states that creditors should \nassume that a consumer will make payments on time and in full. This proposed revision is consistent with existing \ncomment 17(c)(2)(i)-3, which states that creditors may base all disclosures on the assumption that payments will be \nmade on time, disregarding any possible inaccuracies resulting from consumers' payment patterns. Comment \n17(c)(2)(i)-3 specifically addresses disclosures for simple-interest transactions that potentially may be affected by \nlate payments. The proposed revisions to comment 17(c)(1)-1 would clarify that disclosures for all transactions \nsubject to \u00a7 226.17 should be based on the assumption that the consumer will adhere to the terms of the legal \nobligation.\n\n\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-2 would be revised to clarify that transactions secured by real property or a dwelling are subject \nto the special disclosure rules under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3) and (c). Under the proposal, preferred-rate loans with \na fixed interest rate would not be considered ARMs, and therefore, comment 17(c)(1)-2 also would be revised to \nremove the cross-reference to \u00a7 226.19(b). Comment 17(c)(1)-2 would be redesignated as 17(c)(1)-2(i) through (iii). \nComment 17(c)(1)-16, which addresses disclosure for credit extensions that may be treated as multiple \ntransactions, would be moved and redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)-3; no substantive change is intended.\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-15 states that where a deposit account is created for the sole purpose of accumulating payments \nthat are applied to satisfy the consumer's credit obligation--a practice used in Morris Plan transactions--payments to \nthat account are treated the same as loan payments. Under the proposal, comment 17(c)(1)-15 would be removed. \nAs discussed below, Morris Plan transactions are rare. In addition, the Board believes that such deposits clearly \nconstitute loan payments and therefore comment 17(c)(1)-15 is unnecessary.\n\nThe remaining commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(1) would be revised and redesignated as discussed below under \nproposed subsections 17(c)(1)(i) through (vi).\n\n17(c)(1)(i) Buydowns\n\nComments 17(c)(1)-3 through 17(c)(1)-5 address third-party buydowns, consumer buydowns, and split buydowns, \nrespectively. The proposed rule would add a new provision in \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(i) that reflects that existing \ncommentary about buydowns. Proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(i) requires creditors to disclose an APR that is a composite \nrate, based on the rate in effect during the initial period and the rate in effect for the remainder of the loan's term, if \nthe consumer's interest rate or payments are reduced for all or part of the loan term. Proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(i) \napplies to seller or third-party buydowns if they are reflected in the legal obligation, and to all consumer buydowns.\n\nComments 17(c)(1)-3 through 17(c)(1)-5 would be redesignated as comments 17(c)(1)(i)-1 through -4 and revised \nto reflect changes in the terminology used under the proposed rule to describe the finance charge, for transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n17(c)(1)(ii) Wrap-Around Financing\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-6 provides guidance on disclosures for transactions that involve wrap-around financing; \ncomment 17(c)(1)-7 provides guidance on disclosures for wrap-around transactions that include a balloon payment. \nBoth comments state that, in transactions that involve wrap-around financing, the amount financed equals the sum \nof the new funds advanced by the wrap creditor and the remaining principal owed to the original creditor on the pre-\nexisting loan. The proposed rule would incorporate this guidance into proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(ii). Comments \n17(c)(1)-6 and 17(c)(1)-7 would be redesignated as comments 17(c)(1)(ii)-1 and 17(c)(1)(ii)-2, respectively; no \nsubstantive change is intended.\n\n17(c)(1)(iii) Variable- or Adjustable-Rate Transactions\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-8 currently provides that creditors should base disclosures for variable- or adjustable-rate \ntransactions on the full term of the transaction and the terms in effect at the time of consummation and should not \nassume that the rate will increase. The proposed rule would incorporate that guidance into proposed \u00a7 \n226.17(c)(1)(iii). Proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii) would require creditors to base disclosures for variable- or adjustable-\nrate transactions on the full loan term, and on the terms in effect at the time of consummation, except as otherwise \nprovided under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii) or 226.38(a)(3) and (c) for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling.\n\nAs discussed below under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c), creditors would be required to disclose specified rate and \npayment adjustments for adjustable-rate loans secured by real property or a dwelling. As a result, comment \n17(c)(1)-8 would be revised to clarify that creditors must disclose specified rate and payment adjustments for \n\n\n\nadjustable-rate loans secured by real property or a dwelling in accordance with the requirements under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(c). Current comment 17(c)(1)-8 would be redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-1.\n\nCurrent comment 17(c)(1)-9, which states that a variable-rate feature does not, by itself, make the disclosures \nestimates, would be redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-2. No substantive change is intended.\n\n17(c)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) Discounted and Premium Rates\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-10 provides that if the initial interest for a variable-rate transaction is not determined by the index \nor formula used to make later interest-rate adjustments, disclosures should reflect a composite APR based on the \ninitial interest rate for as long as it is charged and, for the remainder of the term, the rate that would have been \napplied using the index or formula at the time of consummation. The proposed rule would incorporate that \ncommentary into proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii)(B).\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii) contains two separate disclosure rules; which disclosure rule applies depends on \nwhether or not the initial rate is determined using the same index or formula used to make subsequent rate \nadjustments. If the initial rate is determined using the same index or formula used for subsequent rate adjustments, \nthen the general rule that disclosures must reflect the terms in effect at the time of consummation applies under \nproposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii)(A). If the initial rate is set using a different index or formula, however, disclosures must \nreflect a composite APR under proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii)(B). The composite APR would be based on the initial \nrate for as long as it is charged and, for the remainder of the loan term, the rate that would have applied if such \nindex or formula had been used at the time of consummation. Comments 17(c)(1)-10(i) through (vi) would be \nrevised to reflect that, under the proposed rule, for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, new \nterminology would be used for specified disclosures (for example, the term \"interest and settlement charges\" would \nbe used in place of \"finance charge\"), as discussed below. Comments 17(c)(1)-10(i) through (vi) also would be \nredesignated as comments 17(c)(1)(iii)-3(i) through (vi); no substantive change is intended. Finally, a cross-\nreference in comment 24(c)-4 would be updated to reflect the redesignation of comment 17(c)(1)-10.\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-11 provides that variable rate transactions include the following transaction types, even if initially \nthey feature a fixed interest rate: balloon-payment loans where the creditor is unconditionally obligated to renew, \nbut can increase the interest rate at the time of renewal; preferred-rate loans where the interest rate may increase \nupon some future event; and price-level adjusted mortgages that provide for periodic payment and loan balance \nadjustments. (But see the discussion under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b) on comment 19(b)-5, which clarifies that creditors \nneed not provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b) for specified balloon-payment, preferred-rate, and price-\nlevel adjusted mortgages.) As discussed below, proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3), which address disclosure of loan type for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling, would treat each of these transaction types as fixed-rate loans. \nAs a result, comment 17(c)(1)-11 would be revised to clarify that balloon-payment, preferred-rate, and price-level \nadjusted mortgages secured by real property or a dwelling are considered fixed-rate transactions for the purposes \nof the loan type disclosure required under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3). (See also the discussion under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(c), which clarifies that the loan type attributed to transactions under proposed \u00a7 226,38(a)(3) applies for \npurposes of interest rate and payment summary disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c).)\n\nFurther, certain shared-equity or shared-appreciation mortgages are considered variable-rate transactions under \ncomment 17(c)(1)-11. However, under the proposal, if a mortgage is secured by real property or a dwelling, the \nmortgage would not be considered an adjustable-rate loan solely because of a shared-equity or shared-\nappreciation feature. As discussed under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(F) and 226.38(d)(2)(vi), the Board would \nrequire creditors to disclose shared-equity or shared-appreciation as a loan feature for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. As a result, guidance in comment 17(c)(1)-11 relating to shared-equity and shared-\nappreciation mortgages would be deleted.\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-11 would be redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-4(i) through (iii), except that guidance under \ncurrent comment 17(c)(1)-11 regarding graduated payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without a \nvariable-rate feature would be redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-5. A cross-reference to comment 17(c)(1)-11 \n\n\n\nin comment 30-1 would be updated accordingly. Comment 17(c)(1)-12, which addresses graduated-payment \nARMs, would be redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-6(i) through (iii); no substantive change is intended.\n\nCurrent comment 17(c)(1)-13 states that creditors may base disclosures for growth-equity mortgages (also referred \nto as \"payment-escalated mortgages\") on estimated payment increases, using the best information reasonably \navailable, or may disclose by analogy to the variable-rate disclosures in \u00a7 226.18(f)(1). As discussed below, current \n\u00a7 226.18(f) contains disclosure requirements for variable-rate transactions that differ based on a loan's security \ninterest and term. Under the proposed rule, \u00a7 226.18(f) would be revised so that a loan's security interest, not its \nterm, would determine whether the creditor would provide variable- or adjustable-rate disclosures. Accordingly, \nunder the proposal, the reference made in comment 17(c)(1)-13 to providing disclosures analogous to those under \ncurrent \u00a7 226.18(f)(1) would be deleted, and comment 17(c)(1)-13 would be revised to require creditors to base \ndisclosures for growth-equity mortgages using estimated payment increases. The reference to graduated-payment \nmortgages would be removed for clarity. Comment 17(c)(1)-13 would be redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-7.\n\n17(c)(1)(iv) Reverse Mortgages\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-14 provides that if a reverse mortgage has a specified period for disbursements but repayment is \ndue only upon the occurrence of a future event such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that \nrepayment will occur when disbursements end. The proposed rule would incorporate this commentary into the \nregulation as proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(vi). Comment 17(c)(1)-14 would be revised to clarify that the disclosure \nrequirements for reverse mortgage under \u00a7 226.33 apply only if the consumer's death is one of the conditions of \nrepayment, as provided under \u00a7 226.33(a). Comment 17(c)(1)-14 also would be revised by removing the discussion \nof shared-equity and shared-appreciation features because under the proposed rule transactions with such features \nwould not be deemed adjustable-rate loans solely because of such features, as discussed above. Further, comment \n17(c)(1)-14 would be revised to state that, if a reverse mortgage has an adjustable interest rate and is secured by \nreal property or a dwelling, the creditor must disclose the shared-equity or shared-appreciation feature as required \nunder \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(F) and 226.38(d)(2)(vi). Finally, under the proposed rule comment 17(c)(1)-14 would be \nredesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(iv)-1(i) through (iii).\n\n17(c)(1)(v) Tax Refund-Anticipation Loans\n\nComment 17(c)(1)-17 clarifies that if a consumer is required to repay a tax refund-anticipation loan when the \nconsumer receives a tax refund, disclosures are to be based on the creditor's estimate of the time the refund will be \ndelivered. Comment 17(c)(1)-17 further clarifies that the finance charge includes any repayment amount that \nexceeds the loan amount that is not excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4. The proposed rule would \nincorporate this guidance into the regulation as proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(v). Comment 17(c)(1)-17 which would be \nredesignated as comments 17(c)(1)(v)-1(i) and -1(ii) under the proposed rule. No substantive change is intended.\n\n17(c)(1)(vi) Pawn Transactions\n\nFor pawn transactions, proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(vi) would require creditors to: (1) Disclose the initial sum provided \nto the consumer as the amount financed; (2) include the difference between the initial sum provided to the \nconsumer and the price at which the item is pledged or sold in the finance charge; and (3) determine the APR using \nthe redemption date as the end of the loan term. Proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(vi) is consistent with comment 17(c)(1)-\n18, which would be redesignated as comment 17(c)(1)(vi)-1. No substantive change is intended.\n\n17(c)(2) Estimates\n\nUnder the proposal, \u00a7 226.17(c)(2) would be revised to clarify that proposed \u00a7 226.19(a) would limit creditors' ability \nto provide estimated disclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. As discussed below, \nproposed \u00a7 226.19(a) requires creditors to provide disclosures that consumers must receive no later than three \nbusiness days before consummation and which may not be estimated disclosures. Comments 17(c)(2)(i)-1 and \n\n\n\n17(c)(2)(i)-2, which address the basis and labeling of estimates, respectively, also would be revised to reflect this \nlimitation. In addition, comment 17(c)(2)(i)-3, which states that creditors may base all disclosures on the assumption \nthat consumers will make timely payments, would be revised to clarify that creditors may also assume that \nconsumers would make payments in the amounts required by the terms of the legal obligation. In technical \nrevisions, a heading would be added to \u00a7 226.17(c)(2) for clarity; no substantive change is intended.\n\n17(c)(3) Disregarded Effects\n\nIn technical revisions, a heading would be added to \u00a7 226.17(c)(3) for clarity, and guidance under current comment \n17(c)(3)-1 would be redesignated as 17(c)(3)-1(i) and (ii). No substantive change is intended.\n\n17(c)(4) Disregarded Irregularities\n\nUnder the proposal, \u00a7 226.17(c)(4) would be revised to clarify that creditors may disregard period irregularities \nwhen disclosing the payment summary table, as required under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c), for transactions secured by \nreal property or a dwelling. No substantive change to the treatment of period irregularities is intended.\n\nIn technical revisions, a heading would be added to \u00a7 226.17(c)(4) for clarity. Also, comment 17(c)(4)-1 would be \nredesignated as comment 17(c)(4)-1(i) and (ii), and comment 17(c)(4)-2 would be redesignated as comment \n17(c)(4)-2(i) through (iii). No substantive change is intended.\n\n17(c)(5) Demand Obligations\n\nUnder the proposal, comment 17(c)(5)-1, which addresses demand obligation disclosures, would be revised to \nreflect that proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(D) and 226.38(d)(2)(iv) contain requirements for disclosing a demand \nfeature in transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Comment 17(c)(5)-2, which addresses future events \nsuch as the maturity date, would be revised to clarify that certain disclosures for transactions not secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling may not contain estimated disclosures, as discussed below under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). \nComment 17(c)(5)-3, which addresses demand after a stated period, would be revised to delete obsolete \nreferences to specific loan programs and update cross-references. Comment 17(c)(5)-4, which addresses balloon \npayment mortgages, would be revised to reflect that creditors must disclose a payment summary table for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c) (rather than a payment schedule, \nas required for transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling under \u00a7 226.18(g)) and to update a cross-\nreference. In technical revisions, a heading would be added to \u00a7 226.17(c)(5) for clarity; no substantive change is \nintended.\n\n17(c)(6) Multiple Advance Loans\n\nIn technical revisions, a heading would be added to \u00a7 226.17(c)(6) for clarity; no substantive change is intended.\n\n17(d) Multiple Creditors; Multiple Consumers\n\nSection 226.17(d) addresses transactions that involve multiple creditors and consumers. The Board does not \npropose any changes to these provisions, except that the guidance contained in current comment 17(d)-1 would be \nredesignated as comment 17(d)-1(i) through (iii); no substantive change is intended.\n\n17(e) Effect of Subsequent Events\n\nSection 226.17(e) addresses whether a subsequent event makes a disclosure inaccurate or requires a new \ndisclosure. Under proposed \u00a7 226.20(e), if a creditor obtains insurance on behalf of the consumer subsequent to \nconsummation, the creditor would be required to provide notice before charging for such insurance. The Board \nproposes to revise comment 17(e)-1 to reflect this new requirement.\n\n\n\n17(f) Early Disclosures\n\nUnder the proposal, in addition to providing early disclosures, creditors would be required to provide additional \ndisclosures that a consumer must receive no later than three business days before consummation for transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling. Accordingly, comments 17(f)-1 through -4 would be revised to clarify that the \nspecial disclosure timing requirements under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) would apply to transactions secured by real property or \na dwelling. In technical revisions, guidance in current comment 17(f)-1 would be renumbered and headings revised \nto clarify that some of the current guidance would not apply to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling \nunder the proposed rule.\n\n17(g) Mail or Telephone Orders--Delay in Disclosures\n\nSection 226.17(g) and comment 17(g)-1 permit creditors to delay disclosures for transactions involving mail or \ntelephone orders until the first payment is due if certain information, such as the APR or finance charge, is provided \nto the consumer in advance of any request. As discussed under \u00a7 226.19(a) and 226.20(c), the Board proposes \nspecial timing requirements for disclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling and for adjustable \nrate transactions. As a result, the Board proposes to revise \u00a7 226.17(g) and comment 17(g)-1 to clarify that they do \nnot apply to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n17(h) and 17(i) Series of Sales--Delay in Disclosures; Interim Student Credit Extensions\n\nSections 226.17(h) and (i) address delay in disclosures in transactions involving a series of sales and interim \nstudent credit extensions. The Board does not propose any substantive changes to these provisions. In technical \nrevisions, a cross-reference is corrected.\n\nSection 226.18 Content of Disclosures\n\nAs noted, the Board proposes to require creditors to provide new disclosures for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling under proposed \u00a7 226.38. Accordingly, the Board would clarify under \u00a7 226.18 that creditors \nmust provide the new disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. In \naddition, the Board proposes conforming amendments to \u00a7 226.18 and associated commentary to reflect the new \ndisclosure regime for mortgages, and would redesignate comments as appropriate.\n\n18(a) Creditor\n\nCurrently, \u00a7 226.18(a), which implements TILA Section 128(a)(1), requires disclosure of the identity of the creditor \nmaking the disclosures. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(1). Comment 18(a)-1 states, in part, that this disclosure may, at the \ncreditor's option, appear apart from the other required disclosures. As discussed above, currently, \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) \nfootnote 38, which implements TILA Section 128(b)(1), allows creditors to exclude from the grouped and \nsegregated requirement certain required disclosures, such as the creditor's identity. 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(1). However, \nthe Board proposes to revise the substance of footnote 38 to require the creditor's identity under \u00a7 226.18(a) to be \nsubject to the grouped together and segregated requirement for all closed-end credit disclosures. Thus, the Board \nproposes to revise comment 18(a)-1 to reflect this change.\n\n18(b) Amount Financed\n\nSection 226.18(b) addresses the disclosure and calculation of the amount financed. The Board proposes to revise \ncomment 18(b)-2, which provides guidance regarding treatment of rebates and loan premiums for the amount \nfinanced calculation required under \u00a7 226.18(b). Comment 18(b)-2 primarily addresses credit sales, such as \nautomobile financing, and provides that creditors may choose whether to reflect creditor-paid premiums and seller- \n\n\n\nor manufacturer-paid rebates in the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.18. The Board believes that creditor-paid \npremiums and seller- or manufacturer-paid rebates are analogous to buydowns. Like buydowns, such premiums \nand rebates may or may not be funded by the creditor and reduce costs that otherwise would be borne by the \nconsumer. Accordingly, their impact on the amount financed, like that of buydowns, properly depends on whether \nthey are part of the legal obligation. See comments 17(c)(1)-1 through -5. The Board is proposing to revise \ncomment 18(b)-2 to clarify that the disclosures, including the amount financed, must reflect loan premiums and \nrebates regardless of their source, but only if they are part of the terms of the legal obligation between the creditor \nand the consumer. As discussed below, proposed comment 38(e)(5)(iii)-2 would parallel this approach for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to revise comment 18(b)(2)-1, which addresses amounts included in the amount \nfinanced calculation that are not otherwise included in the finance charge, to remove reference to real estate \nsettlement charges for the reasons discussed more fully under \u00a7 226.4.\n\n18(c) Itemization of Amount Financed\n\nSection 226.18(c) requires a separate disclosure of the itemization of amount financed and provides guidance on \nthe amounts that must be included in such itemization. As discussed below, the Board proposes new \u00a7 \n226.38(e)(5)(iii) to address the calculation and disclosure requirements of the amount financed for transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling. Under the proposal, the substance of footnote 40, which permits creditors to \nsubstitute good faith estimates required under RESPA for the itemization of the amount financed for dwelling-\nsecured transactions, would be moved to new \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(iii).\n\nComment 18(c)-2 affords creditors flexibility in the information that may be included in the itemization of amount \nfinanced. Under the proposal, the Board would revise comment 18(c)-2(i) to remove references made to escrow \nitems and to the commentary under \u00a7 226.18(g) because the proposal renders them unnecessary, and 18(c)-2(vi) \nto reflect a technical revision with no intended change in substance or meaning. The Board also proposes to move \ncomment 18(c)-4 regarding the exemption afforded to RESPA transactions, and 18(c)(1)(iv)-2 regarding prepaid \nmortgage insurance premiums to proposed comments 38(j)(1)(iii)-1 and 38(j)(1)(i)(D)-2, respectively, because they \napply only to dwelling-secured transactions.\n\n18(d) Finance Charge\n\nSection 226.18(d) requires disclosure of the finance charge for closed-end credit. As discussed below, the Board \nproposes new \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii) to address disclosure of the finance charge (renamed \"interest and settlement \ncharges\") for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. As a result, reference to the finance charge \ntolerances for mortgage loans would be moved from \u00a7 226.18(d) to proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii); no substantive \nchange is intended. Technical amendments to comment 18(d)(2) would reflect this revision.\n\n18(e) Annual Percentage Rate\n\nSection 226.18(e) requires disclosure of the annual percentage rate, using that term. The substance of footnote 42 \nwould be moved to the regulatory text of \u00a7 226.18(e). Technical amendments to comment 18(e)-2 would reflect this \nrevision; no substantive change is intended.\n\n18(f) Variable Rate\n\nSection 226.18(f)(1) contains disclosure requirements for variable-rate transactions not secured by a consumer's \nprincipal dwelling and variable-rate transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling if the loan term is one \nyear or less. Section 226.18(f)(1) requires creditors to make the following disclosures within three business days \nafter receiving the consumer's application: (1) Circumstances under which the APR may increase; (2) any \nlimitations on the increase; (3) the effect of an increase; and (4) an example of the payment terms that would result \n\n\n\nfrom an increase. Section 226.18(f)(2) applies to variable-rate transactions secured by a consumer's principal \ndwelling with a loan term greater than one year, and requires creditors to disclose that the loan has a variable-rate \nfeature together with a statement that variable-rate program disclosures (required by current \u00a7 226.19(b)) have \nbeen provided earlier.\n\nThe Board adopted \u00a7 226.18(f)(2) in 1987, at the same time that it adopted \u00a7 226.19(b) (disclosures for variable-\nrate mortgages with terms greater than one year). The Board adopted those provisions based on recommendations \nby the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). 52 FR 48665; Dec. 24, 1987. However, the \nBoard applied the requirements of those provisions only to loans secured by a principal dwelling with a term greater \nthan one year. Loans secured by a principal dwelling with a term of one year or less, and loans not secured by a \nprincipal dwelling remained subject to rules in \u00a7 226.18(f)(1). The Board did not apply the new variable-rate loan \ndisclosure requirements to such loans because public comments expressed concern about potential compliance \nproblems for creditors making short-term loans. 52 FR at 48666.\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.38(c) contain disclosure requirements for closed-end adjustable-rate loans secured \nby real property or a dwelling, and would apply the same rules to loans with a term of one year or less as for loans \nwith a term greater than one year. Disclosures required by those provisions are discussed below. As a result, \u00a7 \n226.18(f)(2) and comment 18(f)(2)-1, which address requirements and guidance for closed-end adjustable-rate \nloans secured by real property or a dwelling, are unnecessary and would be deleted. The substance of footnote 43, \nwhich permits creditors to substitute information required under \u00a7 226.18(f)(2) and 226.19(b) for the disclosures \nrequired by \u00a7 226.18(f)(1), would also be deleted. Section 226.18(f)(1)(i) through (iv) would be redesignated as \u00a7 \n226.18(f)(1) through (4), and references in comment 18(f)-1 would be updated.\n\nAs discussed below, proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(3)(iii) and 226.38(d)(2)(iii) regarding disclosure of shared-equity or \nshared-appreciation loan features would render guidance about shared-equity or shared-appreciation mortgages in \ncomment 18(f)-1 unnecessary, and therefore that comment would be deleted. Comment 18(f)(1)-1 regarding terms \nused in disclosures, and comment 18(f)(1)(i)-2 regarding conversion features would be redesignated as comments \n18(f)-2 and -3, respectively. Finally, comments 18(f)(1)(i)-1, 18(f)(1)(ii)-1, 18(f)(1)(iii)-1, and 18(f)(1)(iv)-1 would be \nredesignated as comments 18(f)(1)-1, 18(f)(2)-1, 18(f)(3)-1, and 18(f)(4)-1, respectively.\n\n18(g) Payment Schedule\n\nSection 226.18(g) and associated commentary address the disclosure of the payment schedule for all closed-end \ncredit. As discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c), the Board would require creditors to provide disclosures \nregarding interest rates and monthly payments in a tabular format for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling. As a result, creditors would not need to comply with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.18(g) for such \ntransactions. However, as discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i), creditors would be required to disclose the \nnumber and total amount of payments that the consumer would make over the full term of the loan for transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling. Proposed comment 18(e)(5)(i)-1 would require creditors to calculate the total \npayments following the rules under \u00a7 226.18(g) and associated commentary. As a result, the Board proposes to \nrevise comment 18(g)-3 to require creditors to disclose the total number of payments for all payment levels as a \nsingle figure for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, and to cross-reference proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(e)(5)(i).\n\n18(h) Total of Payments\n\nIn a technical revision, the substance of footnote 44 would be moved to the regulation text of \u00a7 226.18(e); technical \namendments to comment 18(h)-3 would reflect this revision.\n\n18(i) Demand Feature\n\n\n\nSection 226.18(i) and associated commentary address the following for all closed-end credit: disclosure of a \ndemand feature; the type of demand features covered; and the relationship to payment schedule disclosures. The \nBoard does not propose any change to this provision, except that comments 18(i)-2 and -3 would be updated to \ncross-reference proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iv) and 226.38(c), which address the disclosure requirements for a \ndemand feature and payment schedule, respectively, for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. No \nsubstantive change is intended.\n\n18(k) Prepayment\n\nSection 226.18(k)(1) provides that, when an obligation includes a finance charge computed from time to time by \napplication of a rate to the unpaid principal balance, the creditor must disclose a statement that indicates whether or \nnot a penalty may be imposed if the obligation is prepaid in full. Comment 18(k)(1)-1 provides examples of charges \nconsidered penalties under \u00a7 226.18(k)(1). One such example is \"interest charges for any period after prepayment \nin full is made.\" When the loan is prepaid in full, there is no balance to which the creditor may apply the interest \nrate. Accordingly, the proposed rule would revise this example for clarity; no substantive change is intended. \nProposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) contains requirements for disclosing prepayment penalties for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. As discussed below, commentary on proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) is consistent with the \ncommentary on \u00a7 226.18(k), as proposed to be revised.\n\n18(j) Through 18(m) Total Sale Price; Prepayment; Late Payment; Security Interest\n\nSections 226.18(j), (k), (1), and (m) address, respectively, disclosures regarding: total sale price; prepayment; late \npayment; and security interest. The Board does not propose any changes to these provisions, except for a minor \ntechnical amendment to comment 18(k)(l)-1, as discussed above. However, as noted below, the Board proposes \nnew disclosure requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(a)(5) and 226.38(d)(1)(iii) regarding prepayment penalties, \u00a7 \n226.38(j)(3) regarding late payment, and \u00a7 226.38(f)(2) regarding security interest, for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling.\n\n18(n) Insurance and Debt Cancellation\n\nSection 226.18(n) requires disclosure of insurance and debt cancellation in accordance with the requirements under \n\u00a7 226.4(d) to exclude such fees from the finance charge. For the reasons discussed under \u00a7 226.4(d), the Board \nproposes to revise \u00a7 226.18(n) and comment 18(n)-2 to clarify that this disclosure requirement also applies to debt \nsuspension policies.\n\n18(o) and 18(p) Certain Security-Interest Charges; Contract Reference\n\nSections 226.18(o) and (p) address, respectively, disclosures regarding certain security-interest charges and \ncontract reference. The Board does not propose any changes to these provisions. However, as noted below, the \nBoard would require creditors to provide parallel contract references for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(5). No parallel disclosure for security-interest charges is proposed for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling because such disclosures would not apply to those transactions \nunder the Board's proposed revisions to \u00a7 226.4, discussed above.\n\n18(q) Assumption Policy\n\nSection 226.18(q) and associated commentary require disclosure of assumption policies for residential mortgage \ntransactions. Under the proposal, the Board proposes to move \u00a7 226.18(q) and comments 18(q)-1 and -2 to \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(6) and comments 38(j)(6)-1 and -2, respectively, because assumption policies apply only to \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. No substantive change is intended.\n\n\n\n18(r) Required Deposit\n\nSection 226.18(r) addresses disclosure requirements when creditors require consumers to maintain deposits as a \ncondition to the specific transaction. Footnote 45 provides additional guidance on such required deposits and \nincludes a reference to payments made under Morris Plans. Although at least one Morris Plan bank remains active, \nMorris Plans essentially are obsolete today. Accordingly, the Board proposes to move the substance of footnote 45 \nto the regulation text but delete the reference to Morris Plans. Comments 18(r)-1, -3, and -5 would also be similarly \nrevised. In addition, under the proposal, comment 18(r)-2 on pledged-account mortgages would be moved to \ncomment 38(i)-2 because it applies only to transactions secured by real property. (See also comment 17(c)(1)-15 \non Morris Plans, which the Board proposes to delete as unnecessary.) Comment 18(r)-6 would be redesignated as \ncomment 18(r)-6(i) through (vii).\n\nSection 226.19 Early Disclosures and Adjustable-Rate Disclosures for Transactions Secured by Real Property or a \nDwelling\n\nSection 226.19(a) currently contains timing requirements for providing disclosures for closed-end transactions \nsecured by a dwelling and subject to RESPA. Section 226.19(b) contains disclosure timing and content \nrequirements for variable-rate loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The Board proposes to revise \u00a7 \n226.19(a) and (b) to apply the disclosures to any closed-end transaction secured by real property or a dwelling, for \nreasons discussed below. Section 226.19(a) also would be revised to require creditors to provide new disclosures \nthat a consumer must receive at least three business days before consummation, in addition to the existing \nrequirement to provide early disclosures within three business days of application. The Board also proposes to \nrevise the content of disclosures for ARMs required under \u00a7 226.19(b), require new disclosures about risky loan \nfeatures in proposed \u00a7 226.19(c), and to include existing rules about disclosures provided through an intermediary \nagent or broker, or by telephone or electronic communication, in proposed \u00a7 226.19(d).\n\n19(a) Good Faith Estimates of Mortgage Transaction Terms and New Disclosures\n\nTILA Section 128(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2), requires creditors to mail or deliver to consumers good faith \nestimates of disclosures required by TILA Section 128(a), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a) (early disclosures), for a transaction \nsecured by a dwelling and subject to RESPA. As amended by the MDIA, TILA Section 128(b)(2) requires creditors \nto deliver or mail the early disclosures at least seven business days before consummation. Further, TILA Section \n128(b)(2), as amended by the MDIA, requires that the creditor provide corrected disclosures if the disclosed APR \nchanges in excess of a specified tolerance. The consumer must receive the corrected disclosures no later than \nthree business days before consummation. The Board implemented these MDIA requirements in \u00a7 226.19(a) \nthrough a final rule effective July 30, 2009 (MDIA Final Rule). 74 FR 23289; May 19, 2009.\n\nThe Board proposes to expand the coverage of \u00a7 226.19(a) so that the timing provisions would apply to closed-end \nmortgage transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, and would not be limited to RESPA-covered \ntransactions. Thus, proposed \u00a7 226.19(a) would apply to transactions secured by real property that does not include \na dwelling, such as vacant land, and transactions that are not subject to RESPA, such as construction loans.\n\nThe Board also proposes to revise \u00a7 226.19(a) so that, in addition to the early disclosures, the creditor must provide \nfinal disclosures that the consumer must receive no later than three business days before consummation. Under \nexisting \u00a7 226.19(a), by contrast, a consumer must receive new disclosures at least three business days before \nconsummation only if changes to the previously disclosed APR exceed a specified tolerance. The Board is \nproposing two alternative provisions to address circumstances where terms change after the consumer has \nreceived the final disclosures.\n\n19(a)(1)(i) Time of Good Faith Estimates of Disclosures\n\n\n\nTILA Section 128(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2), as amended by the MDIA, requires creditors to provide early \ndisclosures if a transaction is secured by a dwelling and subject to RESPA. However, TILA's early disclosure \nrequirements do not apply to mortgage transactions for personal, family, or household purposes if they are secured \nby real property that is not a dwelling, for example a consumer's business property. Creditors need not provide \nearly disclosures for transactions secured by property of 25 acres or more, temporary financing (such as a \nconstruction loan), or transactions secured by vacant land because RESPA does not apply to such transactions. 24 \nCFR 3500.5(b)(1), (3), and (4).\n\nThe Board proposes to expand \u00a7 226.19(a) to cover transactions secured by real property, even if the property is \nnot a dwelling and even if the transaction is not subject to RESPA. (Transactions secured by a consumer's interest \nin a timeshare plan would be treated differently, as discussed under \u00a7 226.19(a)(5) below.) Under TILA Section \n128(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2), if the transaction is not secured by a dwelling, or is not covered by RESPA, the \ncreditor is only required to provide disclosures before consummation. The Board proposes to require creditors to \nprovide early disclosures under TILA for all closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling to \nfacilitate compliance.\n\nSection 226.18 currently contains requirements for the content of transaction-specific disclosures secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling, whether or not creditors are required to provide that content in early disclosures. Although \nunder the proposed rule \u00a7 226.38 rather than \u00a7 226.18 would contain requirements for disclosure content for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling, the content required in early disclosures is the same as the \ncontent of disclosures provided in cases where early disclosures are not required. Applying the requirement to \nprovide early disclosures to all transactions secured by real property or a dwelling would simplify creditors' \ndetermination of the time by which creditors must make the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38. The Board requests \ncomment about operational or other issues involved in providing early disclosures for temporary loans, however. \nThe Board also solicits comment on whether there are other types of loans exempt from RESPA to which it is not \nappropriate to apply proposed \u00a7 226.19(a).\n\nProposed new comment 19-1 states that proposed \u00a7 226.19 applies to transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling even if such transactions are not subject to RESPA. The proposed comment clarifies that TILA does not \napply to transactions that are primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes, however. (Proposed \ncomment 19-1 addresses the introductory text to proposed \u00a7 226.19, which provides that all of \u00a7 226.19, not only \u00a7 \n226.19(a), applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.)\n\nComment 19(a)(1)(i)-1, which discusses the coverage of \u00a7 226.19(a), would be removed because proposed \ncomment 19-1 would discuss the coverage of all of proposed \u00a7 226.19. Comment 19(a)(1)(i)-2 would be revised to \nclarify that under the proposed rule disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) may not contain estimated \ndisclosures, with limited exceptions. The comment also would be revised to reflect that proposed \u00a7 226.37 contains \nrequirements for disclosure of estimates and contingencies, as discussed below. Comment 19(a)(1)(i)-3 would be \nrevised to reflect that creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X to determine when an application is received, \neven for transactions not subject to RESPA. Comment 19(a)(1)(i)-5 would be revised to refer to the itemization of \nthe amount financed disclosures in proposed \u00a7 226.38(j) rather than in \u00a7 226.18(c), as currently referenced. Finally, \ncomments 19(a)(1)(i)-2 through -5 would be redesignated as comments 19(a)(1)(i)-1 through -4.\n\n19(a)(1)(ii) Imposition of Fees\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the Board published the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule amending Regulation Z, which implements \nTILA and HOEPA. The July 2008 final rule requires creditors to give transaction-specific cost disclosures no later \nthan three business days after receiving a consumer's application, for closed-end mortgage transactions secured by \na consumer's principal dwelling, under \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i). Further, the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule prohibits creditors \nand other persons from imposing a fee on the consumer, other than a fee for obtaining the consumer's credit \nhistory, before the consumer receives the early disclosures, under \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(ii) and (iii). Section \n226.19(a)(1)(ii) provides that if the early disclosures are mailed to the consumer, the consumer is considered to \nhave received them three business days after they are mailed. 73 FR 44522, 44600-44601.\n\n\n\nThe proposed rule would revise \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(ii) to conform to the presumption of receipt provision the Board \nsubsequently adopted in the MDIA Final Rule in \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii). 40 Under the proposed rule \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(ii) \nwould be revised to provide that if the early disclosures are mailed to the consumer or delivered to the consumer by \nmeans other than delivery in person, the consumer is deemed to have received the corrected disclosures three \nbusiness days after they are mailed or delivered. This is consistent with comment 19(a)(1)(ii)-1, which provides that \ncreditors may impose a fee any time after midnight following the third business day after the creditor delivers or \nmails the early disclosures in all cases, regardless of the method the creditor uses to provide the early disclosures. \nThe Board does not intend to make substantive changes by conforming the presumption of receipt provisions under \n\u00a7\u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(ii) and 226.19(a)(2)(ii).\n\nThe Board also proposes to revise comment 19(a)(1)(ii)-1 to clarify that the three-business-day presumption of \nreceipt applies in all cases, including where a creditor uses electronic mail or a courier to provide the early \ndisclosures. Proposed comment 19(a)(1)(ii)-1 provides that creditors that use electronic mail or a courier other than \nthe postal service may use the three-business-day presumption of receipt. This comment is consistent with existing \ncomment 19(a)(2)(ii)-3 adopted through the MDIA Final Rule. (Comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-3 would be redesignated as \ncomment 19(a)(2)(v)-1 and conforming edits would be made in connection with the proposed requirement that \ncreditors provide final disclosures that the consumer must receive no later than three business days before \nconsummation, as discussed below.)\n\nAn additional change would be made to comment 19(a)(1)(ii)-1 under the proposed rule. Currently, comment \n19(a)(1)(ii)-1 provides that if the creditor places the early disclosures in the mail, the creditor may impose a fee in all \ncases \"after midnight on the third business day following mailing of the disclosures.\" The Board recognizes that the \nphrase \"after midnight on the third business day\" may be construed to mean either that the creditor may impose a \nfee at the beginning of the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application, or at the \nbeginning of the fourth business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application. Thus, the Board \nproposes to revise comment 19(a)(1)(ii)-1 to provide that the creditor may impose a fee after the consumer receives \nthe early disclosures or, in all cases, after midnight following the third business day after mailing the early \ndisclosures. For example, proposed comment 19(a)(1)(ii)-1 provides that (assuming that there are no intervening \nlegal public holidays) a creditor that receives the consumer's written application on Monday and mails the early \nmortgage loan disclosure on Tuesday may impose a fee on the consumer on Saturday.\n\n19(a)(2)(ii) Three-Business-Day Waiting Period\n\nUnder \u00a7 226.19(a), as revised by the MDIA Final Rule, if changes to the APR disclosed for a closed-end transaction \nsecured by a dwelling and subject to RESPA exceed a specified tolerance, creditors must provide corrected \ndisclosures. The consumer must receive the corrected disclosures no later than three business days before \nconsummation. The tolerance specified for closed-end \"regular transactions\" (those that do not involve multiple \nadvances, irregular payment periods, or irregular payment amounts) is 1/8 of 1 percentage point and for closed-end \n\"irregular transactions\" (those that involve multiple advances, irregular payment periods, or irregular payment \n\n40 On the same day the July 2008 final rule was published, the Congress passed the MDIA. Under the MDIA, if the APR stated in \nthe early disclosures changes in excess of a specified tolerance, the creditor must provide corrected disclosures that the \nconsumer must receive no later than three business days before consummation. The MDIA provides that if the creditor mails the \ncorrected disclosures, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are mailed. These early \ndisclosure rules are contained in TILA Section 128(b)(2)(E) (to be codified at 15 U.S.C. 1638(13)(2)(E)). Section 226.19(a)(2)(ii) \nimplements these rules.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\namounts, such as an ARM with a discounted initial interest rate) is 1/4 of 1 percentage point. See \u00a7 226.22(a) and \nfootnote 46; comment 17(c)(1)-10(iv).\n\nCurrently, if an APR stated in early disclosures for a closed-end transaction not subject to \u00a7 226.19(a) remains \naccurate but other terms that were not labeled as estimates change, the creditor must disclose those changed \nterms before consummation under \u00a7 226.17(f). Creditors also must provide corrected disclosures if a variable-rate \nfeature is added to a closed-end transaction under \u00a7 226.17(f), whether or not the transaction is subject to \u00a7 \n226.19(a). See comment 17(f)-2. In practice, most creditors provide \"final\" disclosures to a consumer on the day of \nconsummation, whether or not the loan terms stated in the early disclosures have changed.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, after providing early disclosures for a closed-end transaction secured by real property or a \ndwelling, creditors would provide a second set of disclosures in all cases, under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii). The consumer \nwould have to receive these final disclosures no later than three business days before consummation. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2)(ii) is designed to address long-standing concerns that consumers may find out about different loan \nterms or increased settlement costs only at consummation. Members of the Board's Consumer Advisory Council \nand commenters on prior Board rulemakings have expressed concern about consumers not learning of changes to \ncredit terms until consummation. Further, several participants in the Board's consumer testing stated that they had \nbeen surprised at closing by important changes in loan terms. For example, some participants said that they had \nbeen told at closing that a loan would have an adjustable rate even though previously they had been told they \nwould receive a fixed-rate loan. Participants said that they closed despite unfavorable changes in loan terms \nbecause they lacked alternatives, especially in the case of a loan financing a home purchase. Some participants \nstated that they accepted changed terms because the loan originator advised them that they could easily obtain a \nrefinance loan with better terms in the near future.\n\nTerms or costs may change after early disclosures are given for a variety of reasons, including that the consumer \ndid not lock the interest rate at application or an appraisal report developed after early disclosures are provided \nshows a different property value than the creditor assumed when providing the early disclosure. Regardless of the \nreason for the changed terms, a consumer who receives notice of changed loan terms at consummation that differ \nfrom those originally disclosed does not have a meaningful opportunity to make an informed credit decision.\n\nTo address concerns about changes to loan terms, proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) requires creditors to provide final \ndisclosures that a consumer would have to receive no later than the third business day before consummation. \nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(4), the early disclosures and final disclosures would contain total estimated settlement \ncosts disclosed under RESPA and HUD's Regulation X, which implements RESPA. Regulation X permits final \nsettlement charges to be disclosed at consummation; the consumer may request that final settlement charges be \ndisclosed twenty-four hours in advance, however. 24 CFR 3500.10(a) and (b). Thus, under RESPA, creditors, \nsettlement agents, and settlement service providers have until the day of consummation to determine the amounts \nof the various settlement costs. Effective January 1, 2010, Regulation X provides that the sum of most lender-\nrequired third party settlement costs may vary no more than 10 percent from the same costs disclosed on the good \nfaith estimate (GFE) delivered earlier. Certain other changes, such as the lender's origination fee, cannot vary, \nunless the consumer did not lock the interest rate.\n\nThe Board believes that proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) would not conflict with tolerance and timing rules under \nRegulation X--that is, creditors could comply with both Regulation Z and Regulation X. However, the Board's \nproposal would require creditors to finalize settlement costs earlier than RESPA does: At least three business days \nbefore consummation, and as much as a week before consummation if the creditor mails the disclosures to the \nconsumer. 41 The Board recognizes that requiring that loan terms and costs be finalized several days before \n\n41 Under existing and proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2), a consumer is deemed to receive corrected disclosures three business days after \na creditor mails them. Under existing and proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2), creditors may but need not rely on the presumption of receipt \nto determine when the three-business-day waiting period begins, whether creditors mail TILA disclosures using the postal \nservice, use a courier other than the postal service, or provide disclosures electronically. Alternatively, creditors may rely on \nevidence of receipt. 74 FR at 23293; 73 FR 44522, 44593; July 30, 2008.\n\n\n\nconsummation would require significant changes to current settlement practices. These changes would generate \ncosts that creditors and third-party service providers would pass on to consumers. The Board solicits comment on \nthe operational and other practical effects of requiring that consumers receive final TILA disclosures for closed-end \nloans secured by real property or a dwelling no later than three business days before consummation.\n\nProposed comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-1 provides that creditors must provide final disclosures even if the terms disclosed \nhave not changed since the creditor provided the early disclosures. Proposed comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-2 provides that \ndisclosures made under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) must contain each of the applicable disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38.\n\nIf escrows for taxes and insurance will be required, creditors may disclose periodic payments of taxes and \ninsurance as estimates under \u00a7 226.38(c). If the creditor includes escrowed amounts when calculating the total of \npayments under \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i), then the total of payments also would be disclosed as estimated disclosures, as \ndiscussed in comment 38(e)(5)-1. Periodic payment disclosures that include escrowed amounts must be estimated \ndisclosures because the creditor cannot know with certainty the amounts for property taxes and insurance after the \nfirst year of the loan. Proposed comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-3 clarifies that other disclosures may not be estimated under \nproposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii). Finally, comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-4 provides an example that illustrates when \nconsummation may occur after the consumer receives the final disclosures.\n\n19(a)(2)(iii) Additional Three-Business-Day Waiting Period\n\nThe Board is proposing two alternative requirements for creditors to provide corrected disclosures after making the \nfinal disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii), to be designated as \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii). Consumers would have to \nreceive the corrected disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii) no later than the third business day \nbefore consummation. Under both Alternative 1 and Alternative 2, comment 19(a)(2)-2 would be revised to reflect \nthat there is more than one three-business-day waiting period under \u00a7 226.19(a).\n\nAlternative 1. The first alternative would require that a creditor provide corrected disclosures if any terms stated in \nthe final disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) change. This would ensure that consumers are aware \nof the final loan terms and costs at least three business days before consummation. The consumer would have to \nreceive the corrected disclosures no later than the third business day before consummation.\n\nUnder Alternative 1, proposed comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-1 clarifies that a disclosed APR is accurate for purposes of \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2)(iii) if the disclosure is accurate under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv). (Under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv), \nan APR disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) or (iii) is considered accurate as provided by \u00a7 226.22, except \nthat in certain circumstances the APR is considered accurate if the APR decreases from the APR disclosed \npreviously, as discussed below.) Proposed comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-2 states that disclosures made under \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2)(ii) must contain each of the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38. Proposed comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-3 \nclarifies that creditors may rely on proposed comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-3 in determining which of the disclosures required \nby \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii) may be estimated disclosures. Proposed comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-4 provides an example that \nshows when consummation may occur after the consumer receives corrected disclosures. Existing comments \n19(a)(2)(ii)-1 through -4 would be removed under Alternative 1.\n\nAlternative 2. It is not clear that it is always in a consumer's interest to delay consummation until three business \ndays after the consumer receives corrected disclosures if any terms or costs change. Thus, the Board proposes an \nalternative \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii) that incorporates the existing tolerance for APR changes under \u00a7 226.22 and \nincorporates an additional tolerance discussed under \u00a7 226.19(a)(iv). If the APR changes beyond the specified \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ntolerances, creditors would be required to provide corrected disclosures that the consumer must receive no later \nthan three business days before consummation.\n\nUnder the second alternative, after the creditor provides the final disclosures, only APR changes beyond the \nspecified tolerances or the addition of a variable-rate feature to the loan would trigger a requirement that consumers \nreceive corrected disclosures no later than three business days before consummation. In other cases, the creditor \nwould have to disclose changed terms no later than the day of consummation, under existing \u00a7 226.17(f). Under \nthis alternative, a consumer would be alerted to significant increases in loan costs and would have three business \ndays to investigate the reason for the change or to consider other options. Smaller APR increases or other changes \nto loan terms would not trigger a three-day delay in consummation, however. This alternative is designed to prevent \nrelatively minor changes in loan terms from repeatedly delaying consummation.\n\nUnder Alternative 2, comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-1 would be redesignated as comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-1 and revised to clarify \nthat creditors must provide corrected disclosures if the APR disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 226.19(a)(ii) becomes \ninaccurate under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv), which incorporates existing tolerances under \u00a7 226.22, or an \nadjustable-rate feature is added. Comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-2 would be redesignated as comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-2 and \nrevised to: (1) Reflect that corrected disclosures must comply with the format requirements of proposed \u00a7 226.37 as \nwell as those of \u00a7 226.17(a); (2) reflect that a different APR will almost always result in changes in \"interest and \nsettlement charges\" and the \"payment summary\" (currently designated as the finance charge and payment \nschedule, respectively); (3) clarify that the addition of an adjustable-rate feature triggers the requirement to provide \ncorrected disclosures, by moving a cross-reference to comment 17(f)-2; and (4) remove guidance on the timing and \nconditions of new disclosures from guidance on disclosure content, for clarity. Proposed comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-3 \nclarifies that creditors may rely on proposed comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-3 in determining which of the disclosures required \nby \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii) creditors may estimate. Under the proposed rule, comment 19(a)(2)(iii)-4 would be revised to \nupdate a cross-reference consistent with the proposed rule and reflect that consumers must receive disclosures \nunder \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) whether or not the disclosures correct the early disclosures.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on whether, under Alternative 2, changes other than APR changes in excess of the \nspecified tolerance or the addition of an adjustable-rate feature after the creditor makes the new disclosures should \ntrigger an additional three-business-day waiting period. For example, should the addition of a prepayment penalty, \nnegative amortization, interest-only, or balloon payment feature trigger a waiting period requirement?\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii) (under Alternative 2) would require corrected disclosures and a new three-business-\nday waiting period if the previously disclosed APR has become inaccurate. Under current rules, a disclosed APR is \nconsidered accurate and does not trigger corrected disclosures if it results from a disclosed finance charge that is \ngreater than the finance charge required to be disclosed (i.e., the finance charge is \"overstated\"). See \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.22(a)(4) and 226.18(d)(1)(ii). In some transactions, the finance charge at consummation might be lower than \nthe amount previously disclosed, for example, if the parties agree to a smaller principal loan amount after early \ndisclosures were made. In the same transaction, the APR might increase because of an increase in the interest rate \nafter the early disclosures were made. In this transaction, at consummation the previously disclosed finance charge \nwould be overstated and the previously disclosed APR understated. In such a case, the question has been raised \nas to whether the previously disclosed APR, which was derived from the overstated finance charge, should be \ndeemed accurate even though it is understated at consummation. The Board believes the APR in this case is not \naccurate. The Board believes an APR \"results from\" an overstated finance charge only if the APR also is \noverstated. The Board solicits comment on whether, should Alternative 2 be adopted, the Board also should adopt \ncommentary under \u00a7 226.22(a)(4) to clarify this interpretation.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv) contains APR tolerances, and proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii) contains tolerances for \ninterest and settlement charges (as the finance charge would be referred to under the proposed rule), for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The Board solicits comment on whether, under \u00a7 \n226.38(e)(5)(ii), tolerances would be appropriate for numerical disclosures other than the APR and interest and \nsettlement charges. For example, would dollar tolerances for overstatements of periodic payment disclosures \n\n\n\nrequired by \u00a7 226.38(c) be appropriate? What standards should be used to prevent overstated disclosures from \nundermining the integrity of the early disclosures and their usefulness as a shopping tool?\n\n19(a)(2)(iv) Annual Percentage Rate Accuracy\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv), an APR disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) or (iii) is considered \naccurate as provided by \u00a7 226.22, except that the APR also is considered accurate if the APR decreases due to a \ndiscount (1) the creditor gives the consumer to induce periodic payments by automated debit from a consumer's \ndeposit account or (2) the title insurer gives the consumer on owner's title insurance. Thus, such APR changes \nwould not trigger a new three-business-day waiting period. Comment 19(a)(2)(iv)-1 clarifies that if a change occurs \nthat does not render the APR inaccurate under \u00a7 226.19(a)(iv), the creditor must disclose the changed terms before \nconsummation, consistent with \u00a7 226.17(f). The Board solicits comment on whether a disclosed APR that is higher \nthan the actual APR at consummation should be considered accurate in other circumstances.\n\n19(a)(2)(v) Timing of Receipt\n\nAs adopted by the MDIA Final Rule, \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) provides that consumers must receive corrected disclosures, \nif required, no later than three business days before consummation. Further, \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) provides that if the \ncorrected disclosures are mailed to the consumer or delivered to the consumer by means other than delivery in \nperson, the consumer is deemed to have received the disclosures three business days after they are mailed or \ndelivered. The proposed rule applies this presumption for purposes of both the waiting period under proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2)(ii) and the waiting period under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii). The presumption would be moved to \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2)(v) under the proposed rule.\n\nProposed comment 19(a)(2)(v)-1 states that whether the creditor provides disclosures by delivery, postal service, \nelectronic mail, or courier other than the postal service, consumers are deemed to receive the disclosures three \nbusiness days after the creditor so provides them, for purposes of determining when a three-business-day waiting \nperiod required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) or (iii) begins. Further, proposed comment 19(a)(2)(v)-1 clarifies that creditors \nmay rely on evidence of earlier receipt, regardless of how the creditor provides disclosures to the consumer. This \ncommentary is consistent with the Board's discussion of delivery and mailing under the MDIA Final Rule and the \n2008 HOEPA Final Rule. See 74 FR at 23292-23293; 73 FR at 44593.\n\n19(a)(3) Consumer's Waiver of Waiting Period\n\nSection 226.19(a)(3) and comment 19(a)(3)-1 would be revised to reflect that under the proposed rule the \ndisclosures required for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling are contained in \u00a7 226.38 rather than in \n\u00a7 226.18. Section 226.19(a)(3) also would be revised to reflect that there is more than one three-business-day \nwaiting period under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2); comment 19(a)(3)-1 would be revised to clarify that a separate \nwaiver is required for each waiting period to be waived.\n\nSection 226.19(a)(2)(ii) currently requires creditors to provide corrected disclosures to a consumer if changes to the \ndisclosed APR exceed the specified tolerance (APR correction disclosures). The consumer must receive APR \ncorrection disclosures no later than three business days before consummation. Comment 19(a)(3)-2 provides \nexamples that show whether or not the three-business-day waiting period would need to be waived to allow \nconsummation to occur during the seven-business-day waiting period required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(i), in the event of a \nbona fide personal financial emergency. This example would be removed because proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) \nprovides that, after the creditor provides the early disclosures, consumers must receive final disclosures no later \nthan three business days before consummation in all cases. Comment 19(a)(3)-3 provides examples illustrating \nwhether or not, after the seven-business-day waiting period required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(i), the three-business-day \nwaiting period triggered by APR correction disclosures would need to be waived to allow consummation to occur, in \nthe event of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Comment 19(a)(3)-3 would be revised to reflect that in all \ncases consumers would have to receive final disclosures after the creditor provides the early disclosures under the \n\n\n\nproposed rule and that under proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv) a disclosed APR that is overstated is considered accurate \nin specified circumstances. Comment 19(a)(3)-3 would be redesignated as comment 19(a)(3)-2 under the proposed \nrule.\n\n19(a)(4) Notice\n\nSection 226.19(a)(4) currently requires creditors to disclose that a consumer need not enter into a loan agreement \nbecause the consumer has received disclosures or signed a loan application. This requirement would be moved to \n\u00a7 226.38(f)(1) under the proposed rule. Proposed \u00a7 226.38 contains all content requirements for disclosures for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n19(a)(5) Timeshare Transactions\n\nSection 226.19(a)(5) excludes transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan described in 11 \nU.S.C. 101(53(D)) (timeshare transactions) from \u00a7 226.19(a)(1) through (a)(4), which address the following: (1) The \nperiod within which the creditor must provide the early disclosures and the fact that creditors and other persons \ncannot collect fees from the consumer before the consumer receives the early disclosures; (2) waiting periods after \nthe creditor provides the early disclosures and after the consumer receives corrected disclosures (if any) and before \nconsummation; (3) waiver of waiting periods; and (4) the requirement to disclose a statement that the consumer is \nnot required to consummate a transaction merely because the consumer has received disclosures or signed a loan \napplication.\n\nSection 226.19(a)(5)(ii) contains timing requirements for early disclosures, and \u00a7 226.19(a)(5)(iii) contains timing \nrequirements for corrected disclosures, for timeshare transactions. Waiting periods are not required for timeshare \ntransactions, so \u00a7 226.19(a)(5) does not contain requirements similar to the requirements in \u00a7 226.19(a)(3) for \nwaiving waiting periods for non-timeshare transactions. Section 226.19(a)(5) also does not contain a requirement \nsimilar to that in \u00a7 226.19(a)(4) that disclosures contain a statement that a consumer need not consummate a \ntransaction simply because the consumer receives disclosures or signs a loan application. Section 226.19(a)(4) \nwould be removed under the proposed rule, and a substantially similar requirement would apply under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(f)(1).\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(1) requires creditors to disclose a statement that a consumer is not obligated to consummate \na loan and that the consumer's signature only confirms receipt of a disclosure statement. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(1) \napplies to timeshare transactions. The MDIA exempts timeshare transactions from the requirements of TILA \nSection 128(b)(2)(C), which existing \u00a7 226.19(a)(4) implements. However, the Board does not believe that the \nCongress intended to exempt timeshare transactions from any requirement to disclose to a consumer that the \nconsumer is not obligated to consummate a loan. Thus, the proposed rule does not exempt timeshare transactions \nfrom \u00a7 226.38(f)(1).\n\nSection 226.19(a)(5) would be redesignated as \u00a7 226.19(a)(4) and cross-references adjusted accordingly under the \nproposed rule because \u00a7 226.19(a)(4) would be removed, as discussed above. Comment 19(a)(5)(ii)--1 would be \nrevised to reflect that the coverage of \u00a7 226.19 has been expanded to include transactions not subject to RESPA, \nas discussed above. Comment 19(a)(5)(iii)--1 would be revised to clarify that timeshare transactions are subject to \nthe general requirement to disclose changed terms under \u00a7 226.17(f). Further, comment 19(a)(5)(iii)--1 would be \nrevised to reflect that cross-referenced commentary on variable- or adjustable-rate transactions would be \nincorporated into proposed \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii). Finally, commentary on \u00a7 226.19(a)(5)(ii) and (iii) would be \nredesignated as commentary on \u00a7 226.19(a)(4)(ii) and (iii), respectively.\n\n19(b) Adjustable-Rate Loan Program Disclosures\n\nSection 226.19(b) currently requires creditors to provide detailed disclosures about adjustable-rate loan programs \nand a CHARM booklet if a consumer expresses an interest in ARMs. Section 226.19(b) applies to closed-end \n\n\n\ntransactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year. Creditors must provide \nthese disclosures at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, \nwhichever is earlier. Creditors need not provide these disclosures, however, if a loan is secured by a dwelling other \nthan a principal dwelling (such as a second home) or real property that is not a dwelling (such as vacant land) or \nwith a term of one year or less. For such transactions, creditors instead must provide the less detailed variable-rate \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.18(f)(1) within three business days after receiving the consumer's application, as \ndiscussed above.\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors to provide ARM loan program disclosures, and additional disclosures \ndiscussed below, at the time an application form is provided, for all closed-end transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling, regardless of the length of the loan's term. The ARM disclosures and the new disclosures \nare intended to alert consumers to certain risks before they apply for a loan. The Board believes that consumers \nshould receive this information, even where the loan would be secured by a second home or unimproved real \nproperty, and where the loan term is one year or less. In these circumstances, the transaction likely involves a \nsignificant asset and consumers should receive information about risks, so that they can decide whether the \nprogram or loan feature is appropriate. The Board solicits comment on whether loan program disclosures should be \ngiven at the time an application form is provided to a consumer or before the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, \nwhichever is earlier, for transactions other than ARMs.\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors to provide the following disclosures at the time an application is provided:\n\n. The ARM loan program disclosure, for each program in which the consumer expresses an interest (proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(b));\n\n. The \"Key Questions about Risk\" document published by the Board (proposed \u00a7 226.19(c)); and\n\n. The \"Fixed vs. Adjustable-Rate Mortgages\" document published by the Board (proposed \u00a7 226.19(c)).\n\nCreditors no longer would be required to provide the CHARM booklet, as discussed under \u00a7 226.19(c).\n\nCurrent content of ARM loan program disclosures. For adjustable-rate mortgage transactions secured by a \nconsumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year, \u00a7 226.19(b)(2) requires the creditor to provide \ndisclosures to consumers at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable \nfee, whichever is earlier. Section 226.19(b)(2) requires creditors to provide the following disclosures, as applicable, \nfor each adjustable-rate loan program in which the consumer expresses an interest: (1) The fact that interest rate, \npayment, or term of the loan can change, (2) the index or formula used in making adjustments, and a source of \ninformation about the index or formula, (3) an explanation of how the interest rate and payment will be determined, \nincluding an explanation of how the index is adjusted, such as by the addition of a margin, (4) a statement that the \nconsumer should ask about the current margin value and current interest rate, (5) the fact that the interest rate will \nbe discounted, and a statement that the consumer should ask about the amount of the interest rate discount, (6) \nthe frequency of interest rate and payment changes, (7) any rules relating to changes in the index, interest rate, \npayment amount, and outstanding loan balance, (8) pursuant to TILA Section 128(a)(14), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(14), \neither (a) an historical example based on a $ 10,000 loan amount that illustrates how interest rate changes \nimplemented according to the terms of the loan program would have affected payments and the loan balance over \nthe past fifteen years or (b) the maximum interest rate and payment for a $ 10,000 loan originated at an initial \ninterest rate in effect as of an identified month and year and a statement that the periodic payments may increase \nor decrease substantially, (9) an explanation of how the consumer may calculate the payments for the loan, (10) \nthe fact that the loan program contains a demand feature, (11) the type of information that will be provided in \nnotices of adjustments and the timing of such notices, and (12) a statement that the disclosure forms are available \nfor the creditor's other variable-rate loan programs.\n\nAmendments to maximum rate and historical example disclosures. TILA Section 128(a)(14), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(14), \nrequires creditors to disclose at application (a) a statement that the periodic payments may increase or decrease \nsubstantially and the maximum interest rate and payment for a $ 10,000 loan originated at a recent interest rate, \n\n\n\nassuming the maximum periodic increases in rates and payments under the program or (b) an historical example \nillustrating the effects of interest rate changes implemented according to the loan program. Section 226.19(b)(2)(viii) \nimplements TILA Section 128(a)(14). For the reasons discussed below, the Board proposes not to require creditors \nto provide either the historical example or the maximum interest rate and payment based on a $ 10,000 loan.\n\nThe Board proposes to eliminate the disclosure of the historical example or the maximum interest rate and payment \nbased on a $ 10,000 loan pursuant to the Board's exception and exemption authorities in TILA Section 105. Section \n105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include \nfacilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uniformed use of credit. \nSee 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Section 105(f) authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions from \ncoverage under any part of TILA if the Board determines that coverage under that part does not provide a \nmeaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). The \nBoard must make this determination in light of specific factors. See 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2). These factors are (1) the \namount of the loan and whether the disclosure provides a benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction \ninvolving a loan of such amount; (2) the extent to which the requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more \nexpensive the credit process; (3) the status of the borrower, including any related financial arrangements of the \nborrower, the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction, and the importance to the \nborrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage under TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the \nprincipal residence of the borrower; and (5) whether the exemption would undermine the goal of consumer \nprotection.\n\nThe Board has considered each of these factors carefully and based on that review believes that the proposed \nexemption is appropriate. Consumer testing conducted by the Board showed that examples based on hypothetical \nloan amounts and interest rates may be confusing to consumers and may not provide meaningful benefit. Several \nparticipants thought the historical example showed payments and rates that actually would apply if the participant \nchose the loan program described in the disclosure. Some participants mistakenly thought that the disclosures \ndescribed an ARM with a fifteen-year term because the disclosure showed fifteen years' worth of index changes \nunder an ARM program. Some consumer testing participants said that disclosures based on a hypothetical $ \n10,000 loan amount are not useful to them; these consumers said they wanted to see information about rates and \nterms that would actually apply in the context of their own loan amount.\n\nThe Board's exception and exemption authority under Sections 105(a) and (f) does not apply in the case of a \nmortgage referred to in Section 103(aa), which are high-cost mortgages generally referred to as \"HOEPA loans.\" \nThe Board does not believe that this limitation restricts its ability to apply the proposed changes to all mortgage \nloans, including HOEPA loans. This limitation on the Board's general exception and exemption authority is a \nnecessary corollary to the decision of the Congress, as reflected in TILA Section 129(l)(1), to grant the Board more \nlimited authority to exempt HOEPA loans from the prohibitions applicable only to HOEPA loans in Section 129(c) \nthrough (i) of TILA. See 15 U.S.C. 1639(l)(1). Here, the Board is not proposing any exemptions from the HOEPA \nprohibitions. This limitation does raise a question as to whether the Board could use its exception and exemption \nauthority under Sections 105(a) and (f) to except or exempt HOEPA loans, but not other types of mortgage loans, \nfrom other, generally applicable TILA provisions. That question, however, is not implicated by this proposal.\n\nHere, the Board is proposing to apply its general exception and exemption authority to eliminate information from \nthe ARM loan program disclosure that consumers find confusing or not useful, for all loans secured by real property \nor a dwelling, including both HOEPA and non-HOEPA loans, in order to fulfill the statute's purpose of facilitating \nconsumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit. It would not \nbe consistent with the statute or with Congressional intent to interpret the Board's authority under Sections 105(a) \nand (f) in such a way that the proposed revisions could apply only to mortgage loans that are not subject to HOEPA. \nReading the statute in a way that would deprive HOEPA borrowers of improved ARM loan program disclosures is \nnot a reasonable construction of the statute and contravenes the Congress's goal of ensuring \"that enhanced \nprotections are provided to consumers who are most vulnerable to abuse.\" n42\n\n\n\nThe Board notes that proposed \u00a7 226.38(c) would require creditors to provide consumers with the maximum \npossible interest rate and payment within three business days after the consumer applies for an ARM or a loan in \nwhich payments may vary. See discussion of \u00a7 226.38(c). Consumer testing indicated that consumers find this \ninformation very useful when provided in the context of an actual loan offer, in contrast to the information for a \nhypothetical loan amount in relation to an historical interest rate or the interest rate or for a recently originated loan, \nas required by TILA Section 128(a)(14).\n\nIn addition to removing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii), the proposed rule would remove the related requirement under \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2)(ix) that creditors explain how a consumer may calculate payments for the consumer's loan amount \nbased on either the initial interest rate used to calculate the maximum interest rate and payment disclosure or the \nmost recent payment shown in the historical example. The proposed rule also would eliminate commentary on \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). Further, the proposed rule would eliminate comment 19(b)(2)-2(i)(I), which provides that if \na loan feature must be taken into account in preparing the historical example of payment and loan balance \nmovements required by \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii), variable-rate loans that differ as to that feature constitute separate loan \nprograms under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2).\n\nAmendments to other regulations and comments. Comment 19(b)--1 currently provides that in an assumption of an \nadjustable-rate mortgage transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one \nyear, disclosures need not be provided under \u00a7\u00a7 226.18(f)(2)(ii) or 226.19(b). Comment 19(b)--2(iv) currently \nprovides that in cases where an open-end credit account will convert to a closed-end transaction subject to \u00a7 \n226.19(b), the creditor must provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b). The proposed rule would integrate the \nforegoing commentary into \u00a7 226.19(b). Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b) would apply to all closed-end mortgage transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling regardless of loan security or term, however, as discussed above.\n\nThe proposed rule would not require program disclosures to contain an explanation of how payments will be \ndetermined, a disclosure that creditors must make under existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(iii). In general, consumer testing \nparticipants preferred to receive specific information about the amount of the payments they would have to make, \nwhich generally is not available at the time the consumer submits a loan application. Most participants found model \nloan program disclosures based on current requirements to be confusing because they contained complex \nterminology. Participants responded much more positively to revised model disclosures, which did not discuss \ntechnical issues about how payments are determined. If a creditor chooses to include an explanation of how \npayments will be determined, the explanation must be disclosed apart from the segregated disclosures that \nproposed \u00a7 226.19(b) requires, as a general rule under proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2), discussed below.\n\nFootnote 45a to \u00a7 226.19(b) currently states that creditors may substitute information provided in accordance with \nvariable-rate regulations of other federal agencies for the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b). The proposed rule \nwould remove and reserve that footnote and comment 19(b)--4. The footnote was designed to account for the fact \nthat disclosure rules for variable-rate loans issued by HUD, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) were in effect when the Board adopted \u00a7 226.19(b). No comprehensive \ndisclosure requirements for variable-rate loans currently are in effect under the rules of HUD, the OCC, or the Office \nof Thrift Supervision (OTS), the successor agency to the FHLBB. No such requirements are in effect under the rules \nof the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) either. \nMoreover, HUD and the OTS have incorporated the disclosure requirements for variable-rate loans under TILA and \nRegulation Z into their own regulations by cross-reference. 43 Accordingly, footnote 45a no longer appears to be \n\n43 See 24 CFR 203.49(g) (HUD); 12 CFR 560.210 (OTS). Some of those agencies have issued regulations that apply to \nadjustable rate mortgages. See, e.g., 12 CFR 34.22 (OCC) (requiring that an index specified in a national bank's loan \ndocuments for an ARM subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) be readily available to and verifiable by a borrower and beyond the bank's \ncontrol). Those requirements do not establish comprehensive disclosure requirements, however.\n\n \n\n\n\nnecessary. The Board requests comment, however, on whether there are potential inconsistencies between any \nARM loan disclosures required by other federal financial institution supervisory agencies that Regulation Z should \nspecifically address.\n\nComment 19(b)--5 currently states that creditors must provide disclosures under \u00a7 226.19(b) for certain renewable \nballoon-payment, preferred-rate, and price-level adjusted mortgages with a fixed interest rate, if they are secured by \na dwelling and have a term greater than one year. However, such mortgages lack most of the adjustable interest \nrate and payment features required to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1). For example, the frequency of \nrate and payment changes for a preferred-rate loan with a fixed interest rate likely cannot be known because the \nloss of the preferred rate is based on factors other than a formula or a change in the value of an index. Accordingly, \nunder the proposed rule creditors would not be required to provide ARM loan program disclosures under \u00a7 \n226.19(b) for such mortgages. Creditors would be required to provide ARM loan program disclosures for such \nmortgages if their interest rate is adjustable, however. Cross-references in comment 19(b)--5 would be updated and \nthe comment would be redesignated as comment 19(b)--3 under the proposed rule.\n\nExisting comment 19(b)(2)-2(i) provides examples of particular loan features that distinguish separate loan \nprograms. That commentary would be redesignated as comment 19(b)--5(i) but generally would be unchanged \nunder the proposal, with one exception. Differences among rules relating to loan balance changes would be \nremoved as an example of a particular loan feature that distinguishes separate loan programs. However, \ndifferences in the possibility of negative amortization would continue to distinguish separate loan programs, as \ndiscussed above. Also, existing comment 19(b)(2)(vii)--2(i) on disclosing a negative amortization feature would be \nredesignated as comment 19(b)--5 under the proposal.\n\nThe requirement to provide loan program disclosures for each loan program in which a consumer expresses an \ninterest generally would remain unchanged. However, comment 19(b)(2)-4 would be revised to state that a creditor \n\"must describe\"--rather than \"must fully describe\"--an ARM loan program. The proposal would reduce some of the \nmaterial that creditors must disclose about ARM loan programs to highlight information that is most important to \nconsumers, as discussed above.\n\nUse of term \"Adjustable-Rate Mortgage\" or \"ARM.\" Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b) requires the creditor to disclose the \nheading \"Adjustable-Rate Mortgage\" or \"ARM.\" Participants in the Board's consumer testing showed greater \nfamiliarity with the term \"adjustable-rate mortgage\" than with \"variable-rate mortgage.\" Format requirements in \nproposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(iii) state that the statement must be more conspicuous than, and must precede, the other \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b) and must be located outside of the tables required by proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(4)(iv). Finally, proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(iii) states that creditors may make the \"Adjustable-Rate Mortgage\" \nor \"ARM\" disclosure in a heading that states the name of the creditor and the name of the loan program, such as \n\"ABC Bank 3/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgage.\"\n\n19(b)(1) Interest Rate and Payment Disclosures\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1) requires the creditor to disclose the following information, as applicable, grouped together \nunder the heading \"Interest Rate and Payment,\" using that term: (1) The introductory period, (2) the frequency of \nthe rate and payment change, (3) the index, (4) the limit on rate changes, (5) the conversion feature, and (6) the \npreferred rate.\n\nIntroductory period. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(i) requires the creditor to disclose the period during which the interest \nrate or payment remains fixed and a statement that the interest rate may vary or the payment may increase after \nthat period. This disclosure is similar to that required under existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i). Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(i) \nalso requires the creditor to provide an explanation of the effect on the interest rate of having an initial interest rate \nthat is not determined using the index or formula that applies for interest rate adjustments, that is, of having a \n\n \n\n\n\ndiscounted or premium interest rate. This disclosure requirement is similar to that required under existing \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2)(v). However, the proposed rule would eliminate the requirement that ARM loan program disclosures \nstate that the consumer should ask about the amount of the interest rate discount.\n\nFrequency of rate and payment change. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(ii) requires the creditor to disclose the frequency \nof interest rate and payment changes, as currently is required under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(vi).\n\nIndex. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(iii) requires the creditor to disclose the index or formula used in making adjustments \nand a source of information about the index or formula. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(iii) also requires the creditor to \nprovide an explanation of how the interest rate will be determined, including an explanation of how the index is \nadjusted, such as by the addition of a margin. Those requirements are contained in existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii) and \n(iii). However, the proposed rule eliminates \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(iv), which requires the creditor to disclose that the \nconsumer should ask about the current margin value and current interest rate.\n\nLimit on rate changes. Currently, requirements for disclosing interest rate or payment limitations and carryover are \ncontained in existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(vii). The proposed rule would retain these requirements, under proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(1)(iv). (Existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(vii) also contains a requirement to disclose negative amortization. The \nproposed rule would retain that requirement as proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(B), as discussed below.)\n\nConversion feature. Existing comment 19(b)(2)(vii)--3 provides that if a loan program permits consumers to convert \na variable-rate loan to a fixed-rate loan, the creditor must disclose that the fixed interest rate after conversion may \nbe higher than the adjustable interest rate before conversion. Comment 19(b)(2)(vii)--3 further provides that the \ncreditor must disclose any limitations on the period during which the loan may be converted, a statement that \nconversion fees may be charged, and any interest rate and payment limitations that apply if the consumer exercises \nthe conversion option. The proposed rule would integrate this commentary into proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(v).\n\nPreferred rate. Currently, if the variable-rate mortgage transaction is a preferred-rate loan, the creditor must \ndisclose any event that would allow the creditor to increase the interest rate, for example, upon the termination of \nthe consumer's employment with the creditor, whether voluntary or involuntary. See comment 19(b)(2)(vii)--4. The \ncreditor also must disclose that fees may be charged when the preferred rate no longer is in effect, if applicable. \nThe Board proposes to retain these requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(vi).\n\n19(b)(2) Key Questions About Risk\n\nCurrently, TILA Section 128(a)(14), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(14), and \u00a7 226.19(b)(2), require the creditor to disclose only \ncertain information about certain adjustable-rate mortgage features early in the mortgage application process. The \nBoard believes, however, that the consumer should be aware early in the process of other risky features, in addition \nto adjustable-rate features. For this reason, the Board proposes to require \"Key Question\" disclosures several times \nduring the process to allow consumers to become aware of and track potentially risky features of their loan. \nConsumer testing and document design principles suggest that keeping language and design elements consistent \nbetween forms improves consumers' ability to identify and track any changes in the information being disclosed. As \ndiscussed more fully below, proposed \u00a7 226.19(c)(1) would require the creditor to provide a Board publication \nentitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage\" at the time an application form is provided to the consumer or \nbefore the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, whichever is earlier. The content of this disclosure would be \npublished by the Board and would address important terms related to any type of mortgage, whether fixed-rate or \nadjustable-rate. At the same time, if the consumer expresses an interest in an ARM loan program, proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2) would require the creditor to disclose the \"Key Questions about Risk\" as part of the ARM loan program \ndisclosure. These \"Key Questions\" would be tailored to the specific ARM loan program in which the consumer has \nexpressed an interest. Subsequently, within three days of the creditor receiving the consumer's application for a \nspecific loan program, proposed \u00a7 226.38(d) would require the creditor to make a similar disclosure of \"Key \nQuestions about Risk\" in the transaction-specific TILA disclosure. The list of the \"Key Questions about Risk\" for the \ntransaction-specific TILA disclosure required under proposed \u00a7 226.38(d) would be the same as that required for \nthe ARM loan program disclosure under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2), but the information in the TILA disclosure would \n\n\n\nbe specific to the loan program for which the consumer applied and would apply to fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan \nprograms. The Board believes that consistently using the \"Key Questions\" terminology would enhance consumers' \nability to identify, review, and understand the disclosed terms across all disclosures, and, therefore, avoid the \nuninformed use of credit.\n\nKey questions about risk. As discussed above, current \u00a7 226.19(b)(2) requires the creditor to disclose over 12 loan \nfeatures. Consumer testing showed that the current format for these disclosures was very difficult for participants to \nunderstand. In addition, because the content was so general, participants felt the current disclosure would not help \nthem shop for a mortgage. Therefore, the Board proposes to replace existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2) with a new streamlined \nARM loan program disclosure that would contain key information specific to that loan program. The proposed rule \nwould require creditors to disclose certain information grouped together under the heading \"Key Questions about \nRisk,\" using that term, to draw the consumer's attention to information about the potential adverse impact that \ncertain loan features could have on the consumer's ability to repay the loan. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i) requires the \ncreditor to always disclose information about the following three terms: (1) Rate increases, (2) payment increases, \nand (3) prepayment penalties. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii) would require the creditor to disclose information about \nthe following six terms, but only if they are applicable to the loan program: (1) Interest-only payments, (2) negative \namortization, (3) balloon payment, (4) demand feature, (5) no-documentation or low-documentation loans, and (6) \nshared-equity or shared-appreciation. The \"Key Questions about Risk\" disclosure would be subject to special \nformat requirements, including a tabular format and a question and answer format, as described under proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(4). The Board believes it is critical that consumers be alerted to certain risk factors before they have \napplied for an ARM, so that they can decide whether they want a loan with those terms. The Board solicits \ncomment on whether there are other risk factors that loan program disclosures or publications should identify.\n\nRequired disclosures. As noted above, proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i) requires the creditor to disclose information \nabout the following three terms: (1) Rate increases, (2) payment increases, and (3) prepayment penalties. The \nBoard believes that these three factors should always be disclosed. Rate and payment increases pose the most \ndirect risk of payment shock. In addition, consumer testing showed that interest rate and monthly payment were by \nfar the two most common terms that participants used to shop for a mortgage. The Board also believes that the \nprepayment penalty is a key risk factor because it is critical to the consumer's ability sell the home or to refinance \nthe loan to obtain a lower rate and payments. While the other risk factors are important, those factors are only \nrequired to be disclosed as applicable to avoid information overload.\n\nRate and payment increases. With respect to rate increases, proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i)(A) would require the \ncreditor to disclose a statement that the interest rate on the loan may increase, along with a statement indicating \nwhen the first rate increase may occur and the frequency with which the interest rate may increase. With respect to \npayment increases, proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i)(B) would require the creditor to disclose a statement indicating \nwhether or not the periodic payment on the loan may increase. If the periodic payment on the loan may increase, \nthen the creditor would disclose a statement indicating when the first payment may increase. For payment option \nloans, if the periodic payment may increase, the creditor would disclose a statement indicating when the first \nminimum payment would increase. Proposed comment 19(b)(2)(i)--1 would clarify that the requirement to disclose \nwhen the first rate or payment increase may occur refers to the time period in which the increase may occur, not the \nexact calendar date. For example, the disclosure may state, \"Your interest rate may increase at the end of the 3-\nyear introductory period.\"\n\nPrepayment penalties. If the obligation includes a finance charge computed from time to time by application of a \nrate to the unpaid principal balance, proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i)(C) would require the creditor to disclose a \nstatement indicating whether or not a penalty could be imposed if the obligation is prepaid in full. If the creditor \ncould impose a prepayment penalty, the creditor would disclose the circumstances under which and the period in \nwhich the creditor could impose the penalty. Because of the importance of prepayment penalties, the proposed rule \nwould also require disclosure of this feature under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5). To avoid duplication, proposed \ncomments 19(b)(2)(i)(C)--1 to --3 cross-reference proposed comments 38(a)(5)-1 to --3 for information about \nwhether there is a prepayment penalty and examples of charges that are or are not prepayment penalties.\n\n\n\nSome consumers take out ARM loans planning to refinance or sell the home securing the loan before the rate or \npayment increases. Consumer testing showed that while most participants understood the general meaning of the \nphrase \"prepayment penalty,\" they did not realize that the penalty would apply if they refinanced their loan or sold \ntheir home. The Board believes it is important for consumers to understand that a prepayment penalty may be \nimposed in various circumstances, including paying off the loan, refinancing, or selling the home early.\n\nAdditional disclosures. As noted above, proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii) requires the creditor to disclose information \nabout the following six terms, as applicable: (1) Interest-only payments, (2) negative amortization, (3) balloon \npayment, (4) demand feature, (5) no-documentation or low-documentation loans, and (6) shared-equity or shared-\nappreciation. The Board proposes to require these disclosures only when the feature is present, in contrast to the \nrequired disclosures of proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i). Proposed comment 19(b)(2)(ii)--1 would clarify that \"as \napplicable\" means that any disclosure not relevant to a particular ARM loan program may be omitted. Although \nconsumer testing showed that some participants felt reassured by seeing all of the risk factors whether they were a \nfeature of the loan or not, the Board is concerned about the potential for information overload if the entire list is \nincluded on every ARM loan program disclosure.\n\nInterest-only payments. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(A) requires the creditor to disclose a statement that periodic \npayments will be applied only toward interest on the loan. The creditor would also disclose a statement of any \nlimitation on the number of periodic payments that will be applied only toward interest on the loan and not towards \nthe principal, that such payments will cover the interest owed each month, but none of the principal, and that \nmaking these periodic payments means the loan amount will stay the same and the consumer will not have paid \nany of the loan amount. For payment option loans, the creditor would disclose a statement that the loan gives the \nconsumer the choice to make periodic payments that cover the interest owed each month, but none of the principal, \nand that making these periodic payments means the loan amount will stay the same and the consumer will not have \npaid any of the loan amount. Consumer testing showed that many participants did not understand that there are \nloans where the periodic payments do not pay down the mortgage principal. The Board believes it is important to \nalert consumers to this feature in order to avoid payment shock when the principal becomes due or the periodic \npayment increases.\n\nNegative amortization. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(B) would require the creditor to disclose a statement that the \nloan balance may increase even if the consumer makes the required periodic payments. In addition, the creditor \nwould disclose a statement that the minimum payment covers only a part of the interest the consumer owes each \nperiod and none of the principal, that the unpaid interest will be added to the consumer's loan amount, and that over \ntime this will increase the total amount the consumer is borrowing and cause the consumer to lose equity in the \nhome. The proposed requirement would replace existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(vii), which requires the creditor to disclose \nany rules relating to changes in the outstanding loan balance, including an explanation of negative amortization. \nThe Board believes that information regarding negative amortization should be disclosed because it is a \ncomplicated feature that significantly impacts a consumer's ability to repay the loan. Consumer testing showed that \nparticipants were generally unfamiliar with the term or concept. However, participants generally understood the \nrevised transaction-specific plain-language explanation of negative amortization's causes and effects when \ndisclosed in the \"Key Questions\" format.\n\nBalloon payment. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(C) requires the creditor to disclose a statement that the consumer will \nowe a balloon payment, along with a statement of when it will be due. Proposed comment 19(b)(2)(ii)(C)--1 would \nclarify that the creditor must make this disclosure if the loan program includes a payment schedule with regular \nperiodic payments that when aggregated do not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance. Proposed \ncomment 19(b)(2)(ii)(C)--2 would clarify that the requirement to disclose when the balloon payment is due refers to \nthe time period when it is due, not the exact calendar date. For example, the disclosure may state, \"You would owe \na balloon payment due in seven years.\" The Board believes it is important for the consumer to be aware early in the \nprocess of any potential payment shock.\n\nDemand feature. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(D) would require the creditor to disclose a statement that the creditor \nmay demand full repayment of the loan, along with a statement of the timing of any advance notice the creditor will \n\n\n\ngive the consumer before the creditor exercises such right. Proposed comment \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(D)--1 would clarify \nthat this requirement would apply not only to transactions payable on demand from the outset, but also to \ntransactions that convert to a demand status after a stated period. Proposed comments \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(D)--2 and \n--3 cross-reference comment 18(i)--2 regarding covered demand features and comment 18(i)--3 regarding the \nrelationship to the payment schedule disclosures. The proposed rule replaces existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(x). The Board \nbelieves that demand features are rare in consumer mortgage transactions, but pose a considerable risk when \npresent and, therefore, should be brought to the consumer's attention. Consumer testing showed that participants \nunderstood the revised language regarding a demand feature and thought it was important information.\n\nNo-documentation or low-documentation loans. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(E) would require the creditor to disclose \na statement that the consumer's loan could have a higher rate or fees if the consumer does not document \nemployment, income, or other assets. In addition, the creditor would disclose a statement that if the consumer \nprovides more documentation, the consumer could decrease the interest rate or fees. The Board is concerned that \nconsumers who obtain loans with such features may not understand that they may pay a higher price for this \nfeature.\n\nShared-equity or shared-appreciation. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(F) requires the creditor to disclose a statement \nthat any future equity or appreciation in the real property or dwelling that secures the loan must be shared, along \nwith a statement of the percentage of future equity or appreciation to which the creditor is entitled, and the events \nthat may trigger such an obligation. The Board is aware that a number of shared-equity and shared-appreciation \nprograms are being offered to consumers, including low- and moderate-income borrowers, on various terms. \nConsumer testing showed that participants were generally unfamiliar with the concept of shared-equity or shared-\nappreciation. However, to the extent that a shared-equity or a shared-appreciation feature is being offered as one of \nthe loan terms, participants stated that they would want it disclosed clearly and prominently.\n\n19(b)(3) Additional Information and Web Site\n\nCurrently, \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(iv) and (v) require the creditor to disclose a statement that consumers should ask the \ncreditor about the current margin value and current interest rate or the amount of any interest rate discount. Existing \n\u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(xii) requires a notice that disclosure forms are available for the creditor's other variable-rate \nprograms. Consumer testing indicated that many consumers skim disclosures quickly and become frustrated if they \ncannot quickly locate the key information they seek. Reducing the number of non-specific notices in the loan \nprogram disclosures would increase the likelihood that consumers will read and understand specific disclosures. \nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(3), the creditor would be required to disclose that the consumer may visit the Web site \nof the Federal Reserve Board for more information about adjustable-rate mortgages and for a list of licensed \nhousing counselors in the consumer's area that can help the consumer understand the risks and benefits of the \nloan. The Board believes that streamlining the notice will reduce information overload.\n\n19(b)(4) Format Requirements\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4) contains format requirements for ARM loan program disclosures. As discussed more fully \nin proposed \u00a7 226.37, consumer testing showed that the location and order in which information was presented \naffected consumers' ability to locate and comprehend the information disclosed. Based on these findings, the Board \nproposes, under \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(i), to require that creditors disclose the \"Key Questions about Risk\" using the format \nrequirements for similar disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38, except as otherwise provided in proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4). \nProposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(ii) would require that the disclosures required by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) be \ngrouped together and placed in a prominent location. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(iii) would require that the heading \n\"Adjustable Rate Mortgage\" or \"ARM\" required under \u00a7 226.19(b) be more conspicuous than and precede the other \ndisclosures. The heading would be required to be outside the tables required under this paragraph. The creditor \nwould be permitted to use a heading with the name of the loan program and the name of the creditor, such as \"XXX \nBank 3/1 ARM.\" Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(viii) would require the disclosure of the Board's Web site and list of \nlicensed housing counselors to be disclosed outside of the required tables described below.\n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(iv) to (vii) would require the following special formats for the ARM loan program \ndisclosure: tabular format, question and answer format, highlighted answers, and special order of disclosures. \nProposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(iv) would require the creditor to provide the interest rate disclosure required under \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(1) and the \"Key Questions about Risk\" disclosure required under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2) in the form of two tables \nwith headings, content and format substantially similar to Model Form H--4(B) in Appendix H. Consumer testing \nshowed that using a tabular format improved participants' ability to readily identify and understand key information. \nOnly the information required or permitted by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) would be in this table. In addition, under \n\u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(v), the \"Key Questions about Risk\" disclosures would be required to be grouped together and \npresented in the format of a question and answer in a manner substantially similar to Model Form H--4(B) in \nAppendix H. The table with interest rate information would precede the table with the \"Key Questions about Risk.\" \nConsumer testing showed that using a question and answer format improved participants' ability to recognize and \nunderstand potentially risky or costly features of a loan. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(vi) would require the creditor to \ndisclose each affirmative answer in bold text and in all capitalized letters to highlight the fact that a risky feature is \npresent in the loan. Negative answers (required under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i) but not under proposed \u00a7 \n226.(b)(2)(ii)) would be disclosed in non-bold text. Finally, proposed \u00a7 226.19(b)(4)(vii) would require the creditor to \nmake the disclosures, as applicable, in the following order: Rate increases under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i)(A), payment \nincreases under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i)(B), interest-only payments under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(A), negative amortization \nunder \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(B), balloon payments under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(C), prepayment penalties under \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2)(i)(C), demand feature under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(D), no-documentation or low-documentation loans under \n\u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(E), and shared-equity or shared-appreciation under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(F). This order would ensure \nthat consumers receive critical information about their payments first. Model Clauses and Samples are proposed at \nAppendix H--4(C) through H--4(F).\n\n19(c) Publications for Transactions Secured by Real Property or a Dwelling\n\nBased on the results of consumer testing, under the proposal creditors would be required to provide to consumers \ntwo Board publications for closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The first publication, \nentitled \"Key Questions to Ask about Your Mortgage,\" discusses loan terms and conditions that are important for \nconsumers to consider when selecting a closed-end mortgage loan. The second publication, entitled \"Fixed vs. \nAdjustable Rate Mortgages,\" discusses the respective costs and benefits of fixed-rate mortgages and ARMs.\n\nUnder existing \u00a7 226.19(b)(1), the creditor must provide to the consumer a copy of the CHARM booklet published \nby the Board, or a suitable substitute. The Board consumer tested the CHARM booklet and a sample current loan \nprogram disclosure. Few of the consumer testing participants who had obtained an ARM recalled having seen the \nCHARM booklet. Although many participants thought that the information in the CHARM booklet is useful, \nparticularly the descriptions of \"payment shock,\" prepayment penalties, and negative amortization, most participants \nthought that the CHARM booklet is too long and that they likely would not read it.\n\nThe proposed rule would eliminate the requirement under \u00a7 226.19(b)(1) for creditors to provide the CHARM \nbooklet to consumers who express interest in an ARM transaction, and instead, under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2) \nrequire a brief Board publication showing the principal differences between a fixed-rate loan and an ARM. \nComment 19(b)(1)-- and --2 on the CHARM booklet would be removed accordingly. Also, proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(1) \nwould require creditors to provide to all consumers--regardless of whether they express interest in an ARM--two \nnew single-page Board publications. These new disclosure forms would contain a notice stating where consumers \nmay obtain additional information about ARMs. The Board believes that requiring that creditors provide the \"Key \nQuestions to Ask about Your Mortgage\" publication and the \"Fixed versus Adjustable Rate Mortgages\" publication \nwithout modifications would promote consistency in the information consumers receive about ARMs. Accordingly, \nproposed \u00a7 226.19(c) would require creditors to provide this information \"as published.\"\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors to provide these publications at the time a consumer is given an application \nform or pays a non-refundable fee, whichever is earlier, for fixed-rate mortgage loans as well as variable-rate \nmortgage loans. Special rules for when a consumer accesses an application form electronically and when the \n\n\n\ncreditor receives a consumer's application from an intermediary agent or broker are discussed below. The Board \nsolicits comment on whether there are other loan types for which loan program publications should be given at the \ntime an application form is provided to a consumer or before the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, whichever is \nearlier.\n\n19(d) Timing of Disclosures\n\nProposed comment 19(c)--1 states that creditors are not required to provide disclosures under proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(c) in cases where an open-end credit account will convert to a closed-end transaction. The \"Key Questions \nto Ask About Your Mortgage\" disclosure and the \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\" disclosure would not be \nhelpful at that time, because the creditor and consumer already will have entered into a written agreement. By \ncontrast, transaction-specific disclosures are required in such cases under \u00a7 226.19(b), both as in effect (see \ncomment 19(b)--2(iv)) and as proposed (see proposed \u00a7 226.19(b) and comment 19(b)--2).\n\nExisting \u00a7 226.19(b) requires that creditors provide variable-rate loan program disclosures at the time an application \nform is provided to a consumer or before the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, whichever is earlier. Comment \n19(b)--2 currently discusses when a creditor should provide such disclosures in cases where the creditor receives a \nconsumer's application through an intermediary agent or broker or a consumer requests an application by \ntelephone. The comment also clarifies that if the creditor solicits applications by mailing application forms, the \ncreditor must send the ARM loan program disclosures with the application form. Existing \u00a7 226.19(c) contains \nrequirements for providing variable-rate loan program disclosures when a consumer accesses an application form \nelectronically. (Section 226.17(a)(1) currently permits creditors to provide the ARM loan program disclosures \nelectronically, without regard to the consumer-consent or other provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and \nNational Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq. (E-Sign Act)).\n\nUnder the Board's proposal, timing requirements for ARM loan program disclosures would be consolidated in \nproposed \u00a7 226.19(d). These timing requirements also would apply to the provision of the proposed new \"Key \nQuestions to Ask About Your Mortgage\" and \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\" disclosures. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.19(d)(1) contains the general requirement to provide ARM loan program disclosures (if a consumer expresses \ninterest in ARMs) at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, \nwhichever is earlier. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(1) also specifies that creditors must provide ARM loan program \ndisclosures before charging a fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(2) states that if a consumer accesses an ARM loan application electronically, a creditor must \nprovide the disclosures in electronic form, except as provided in \u00a7 226.19(d)(2). Proposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(2), in turn, \nstates that if a consumer who is physically present in a creditor's office accesses an ARM loan application \nelectronically, the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form. These provisions are \nconsistent with existing comment 19(c)--1(i) and (ii). Comment 19(c)--1 on the form of electronic disclosures would \nbe redesignated as comment 19(d)(2)(i)--1. Commentary on the timing of electronic disclosures, currently contained \nin comment 19(b)--2(v), would be redesignated as comments 19(d)(2)(i)--2 and 19(d)(2)(ii)--1. Further, under the \nproposed rule existing \u00a7 226.17(a) would be revised to include the proposed new Key Questions to Ask About Your \nMortgage\" and \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages\" disclosures among the disclosures creditors may provide \nwithout regard to the consumer-consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(3) contains rules for applications made by telephone or through an intermediary. These rules \nare consistent with existing comment 1(b)--2. Existing comments 19(b)--2(i) through --2(iii) are redesignated as \ncomments 19(d)(3)-1 through 19(d)(3)-3. Existing comment 19(b)--2(iii) states that the creditor must include the \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b) with any application form the creditor sends by mail to solicit consumers. This \ncomment is redesignated as proposed comment 19(d)(3)-3 and revised to cover the Key Questions and Fixed \nversus Adjustable Rate Mortgages disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 226.19(c).\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(4) provides that, where a consumer does not express interest in an ARM until after receiving \nor accessing an application form or paying a non-refundable fee, the creditor must provide an ARM loan program \n\n\n\ndisclosure(s) within three business days after the consumer expresses such interest to the creditor or the creditor \nreceives notice from an intermediary broker or agent that the consumer has expressed interest in an ARM. This is \nconsistent with existing footnote 45b. Existing comment 19(b)--3 is redesignated as comments 19(d)(3)-1 through \n19(d)(3)-3 under the proposed rule.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(5) provides that if the consumer expresses an interest in negotiating loan terms that are not \ngenerally offered, the creditor need not provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b) before an application form is \nprovided. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(5) requires that the creditor provide such disclosures as soon as reasonably \npossible after the terms to be disclosed have been determined and not later than the time the consumer pays a \nnon-refundable fee. Further, proposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(5) provides that in all cases the creditor must provide the \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(c) of this section at the time an application form is provided or before the \nconsumer pays a non-refundable fee, including a fee for obtaining a consumer's credit history, whichever is earlier.\n\nComment 19(b)(2)-1 currently provides that, if ARM loan program disclosures cannot be provided because a \nconsumer expresses an interest in individually negotiating loan terms that the creditor generally does not offer, the \ncreditor may provide disclosures reflecting those terms as soon as reasonably possible after the terms have been \ndecided upon, but not later than the time the consumer pays a non-refundable fee. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(5) \nincorporates that guidance into the regulation. Further, comment 19(b)(2)-1 provides that if, after an application \nform is provided or the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, a consumer expresses an interest in an adjustable-\nmortgage loan program for which the creditor has not provided the ARM loan program disclosures, the creditor \nmust provide such disclosures as soon as reasonably possible. Proposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(6) incorporates that guidance \ninto the regulation. The foregoing guidance is removed from comment 19(b)(2)-1 (which the proposed rule would \nredesignate as comment 19(b)--4) because under the proposed rule timing rules for ARM loan program disclosures \nare contained in \u00a7 226.19(d) rather than \u00a7 226.19(b).\n\nSection 226.20 Subsequent Disclosure Requirements\n\n20(b) Assumptions\n\nSection 226.20(b) currently requires post-consummation disclosures if the creditor expressly agrees in writing with a \nsubsequent consumer to accept that consumer as a primary obligator on an existing residential mortgage \ntransaction. The Board proposes technical changes to \u00a7 226.20(b) and associated commentary to reflect the new \nformat and content disclosure requirements for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling under \u00a7\u00a7 226.37 \nand 226.38.\n\n20(c) Rate Adjustments\n\nFor ARM transactions subject to \u00a7 226.19(b), \u00a7 226.20(c) currently requires creditors to mail or deliver to \nconsumers a notice of interest rate adjustment at least 25, but no more than 120, calendar days before a payment \nat a new level is due. Section 226.20(c) also requires creditors to mail or deliver to consumers an adjustment notice \nat least once each year during which an interest rate adjustment is implemented without an accompanying payment \nchange.\n\nThose adjustment notices must state: (1) The current and prior interest rates for the loan; (2) the index values upon \nwhich the current and prior interest rates are based; (3) the extent to which the creditor has foregone any increase \nin the interest rate; (4) the contractual effects of the adjustment, including the payment due after the adjustment is \nmade, and a statement of the loan balance; and (5) the payment, if different from the payment due after adjustment, \nthat would be required to fully amortize the loan at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term. Model \nclauses in Appendix H--4(H) illustrate how creditors may comply with the requirements of \u00a7 226.20(c).\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThe Board adopted the requirements for post-consummation disclosures (subsequent disclosures) in 1987. The \nminimum advance notice of a rate adjustment was set at 25 days to track the rules of the Office of the Comptroller \nof the Currency (OCC) and to provide creditors with flexibility in giving adjustment notices for a variety of ARMs. \nSee 52 FR 48665, 48668; Dec. 24, 1987. Since 1987, ARMs have grown in popularity, especially from 2003 to \n2007. Beginning in 2007, ARM growth began to slow as consumers experienced difficulty repaying such loans and \nconcerns grew about the risk of payment shock ARMs pose.\n\nBecause ARMs pose the risk of payment shock, it is critical that consumers receive notice of ARM payment \nchanges so they can prepare to make higher payments if necessary. If the new payments are unaffordable, \nborrowers need time to seek a refinance loan with lower payments or make other arrangements. Even if a \nconsumer can afford a higher payment, the consumer may want to refinance into a fixed-rate loan for payment \ncertainty or into another ARM loan with lower payments. It is particularly important that consumers with subprime \nloans receive adequate notice before a payment increase, as these borrowers tend to be more vulnerable to \npayment shock.\n\nThe Board believes the current 25-day notice is insufficient to allow many consumers to refinance into a loan with \naffordable payments or to make other arrangements. In the \"Subprime Mortgage Guidance\" issued in 2007, the \nBoard, the OCC, FDIC, OTS, and NCUA stated that consumers should be given at least 60 days before an ARM \nadjustment in which to refinance without paying a prepayment penalty. Several consumer advocates who \ncommented on the Board's 2008 HOEPA Final Rule stated that consumers with subprime ARMs may need \nsignificant time in which to seek out a refinancing, in some cases as much as 6 months.\n\nThe Board's Proposal\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors to mail or deliver a notice of an interest rate adjustment at least 60 days \nbefore payment at a new level is due, instead of the current 25-day provision. Creditors would provide notice \nannually where interest rate changes are made without accompanying payment changes under the proposed. \nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(1)(i) contains timing requirements for circumstances where a payment change accompanies \nan interest rate adjustment, and proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(ii) contains timing requirements for circumstances where no \npayment change accompanies interest rate changes made during a year.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2) contains content requirements for disclosures required where a payment change \naccompanies an interest rate adjustment. Proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3) contains content requirements for disclosures \nrequired once each year where no payment change accompanies an interest rate change. Whether or not a \npayment change is made, under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4) creditors would disclose the following information: (1) The \ndate until which the creditor may impose a prepayment penalty if the consumer prepays the obligation in full, if \napplicable; (2) a phone number the consumer may call to obtain additional information about the loan; and (3) a \ntelephone number and Internet Web site for HUD-licensed housing counselors. Proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5) contains \nformatting requirements for discloses required by proposed \u00a7 226.20(c).\n\nSection 226.20(c) currently provides that an adjustment to the interest rate with or without a corresponding \nadjustment to the payment in an adjustable-rate mortgage subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) is an event requiring new \ndisclosures to the consumer. The proposed rule would retain this provision. Comment 20(c)--1 provides that the \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.20(c) apply where the interest rate and payment change due to the conversion of an \nadjustable-rate mortgage subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) to a fixed-rate mortgage. The proposed rule would incorporate this \nguidance into proposed \u00a7 226.20(c). Further, the proposed rule would revise comment 20(c)--1 for clarity and to \nremove commentary on timing requirements, because timing requirements are contained in proposed \u00a7 \n226.20(c)(1).\n\nThe proposed rule would revise comment 20(c)--2 to clarify that price-level adjusted mortgages and similar \nmortgages are not subject to the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.20(c) because they are not subject to the \ndisclosure timing requirements of \u00a7 226.19(b), as discussed above. The proposed rule would remove the \ncommentary stating that \"shared-equity\" and \"shared-appreciation\" mortgages are not subject to the disclosure \n\n\n\nrequirements of \u00a7 226.20(c) to conform with the removal of reference to such mortgages as examples of variable-\nrate transactions from comment 17(c)(1)-11 (redesignated as proposed comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--4), as discussed \nabove. Under the proposed rule, whether or not creditors must provide ARM adjustment notices for a shared-equity \nor shared-appreciation mortgage depends on whether such mortgage has an adjustable rate or a fixed rate. \nShared-equity and shared-appreciation mortgages with a fixed rate would not be considered adjustable-rate \nmortgages under the proposed rule.\n\n20(c)(1) Timing of Disclosures\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors to mail or deliver a notice of an interest rate adjustment for a closed-end \nARM at least 60, but no more than 120, days before payment at a new level is due. This proposal is designed to \nprovide borrowers with enough advance notice about an impending rate and payment change to enable them to \nrefinance the loan if they cannot afford the adjusted payment. Even if consumers do not need or want to refinance a \nloan, they may need time to adjust other spending in order to afford higher mortgage loan payments.\n\nThe Board issued the current rule requiring 25 days' notice before a payment at a new level is due in 1987. Home \nMortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for the years 2004 through 2007 suggest that a requirement to provide ARM \nadjustment 60, rather than 25, days before payment at a new level is due more closely reflects the time needed for \nconsumers to refinance a loan. 44 In each of those years, for first-lien refinance loans, the period between loan \napplication and origination was 25 days or less for 50 percent of the loans originated, 45 days or less for 75 percent \nof the loans originated, and 65 days or less for 90 percent of the loans originated. (These data do not include time \nneeded to compare available refinance loans.) Requiring creditors to provide an ARM adjustment notice at least 60 \ndays before payment at a new level is due would better enable consumers to arrange to make a higher payment (if \napplicable) without missing a payment or paying less than the amount due.\n\nThe Board believes that a 60-day minimum notice requirement is consistent with many existing ARM agreements. \nFor most ARMs, creditors base the calculation of interest rate changes on the value of an index 30 or 45 days prior \nto the effective date of a rate change (calculation date). Creditors generally refer to the period from the calculation \ndate to the effective date of the interest rate change as the \"look-back period.\" (Interest rate change dates tend to \nbe the first of a month to correspond with payment due dates.) In turn, payment in the new amount is due on the \nfirst day of the month following the month in which interest accrued at the new rate.\n\nThus, for most ARM loans creditors know what the new interest rate and payment will be well before payment at a \nnew level is due, even assuming a week-long lag between publication of an index's level and the creditor's \nverification of that level. In fact, many creditors mail or deliver notice of an interest rate and payment change 60 or \nmore days before payment at a new level is due.\n\nHowever, some ARM agreements may provide for shorter look-back periods. For example, the calculation date for \nsome ARM products is the first business day of the month that precedes the effective date of the interest rate \nchange. The first day of that month may not be a business day, in which case the look-back period would be fewer \nthan 30 days. In addition, it takes time for index levels to be reported and for creditors to confirm the index level and \nprepare disclosures for delivery or mailing.\n\n44 HMDA data consist of information reported by about 8,600 home lenders, including all of the nation's largest mortgage \noriginators. Reported loans are estimated to represent about 80 percent of all home lending nationwide. Accordingly, HMDA \ndata likely provide a broadly representative view of U.S. home lending. Robert B. Avery, Kenneth P. Brevoort, and Glenn B. \nCanner,The 2007 HMDA Data, 94 Fed. Reserve Bulletin A107 (Dec. 23, 2008).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(1) requires creditors to provide advance notice of an adjustment at least 60, but no more than \n120, days before payment at a new level is due, not before the interest rate changes. Comment 20(c)--1 would be \nrevised to reflect the increase in the required advance notice of a payment adjustment. Proposed comment \n20(c)(1)-1 provides that if an adjustable-rate feature is added when an open-end credit account is converted to an \nadjustable-rate transaction, creditors must provide disclosures under \u00a7 226.20(c)(1) where payments change due to \nconversion of a transaction subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) to a fixed-rate transaction. Because relevant payment changes \nunder existing and proposed \u00a7 226.20(c) are those due to interest changes, proposed comment 20(c)(1)-2 clarifies \nthat payment changes due to adjustments in property tax obligations or premiums for mortgage-related insurance \ndo not trigger requirements to disclose interest rate and payment adjustments.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on the operational changes creditors and servicers would need to make to provide \ndisclosures at least 60 days before payment at a new level is due. Are there indices that are published at times that \nwould make compliance with such a rule difficult? Are reported levels for particular indices difficult to confirm within \na few days? The Board requests comment on whether requiring creditors to provide 45, rather than 60, days' \nadvance notice of a payment change better balance concerns about providing sufficient notice to consumers and \nsufficient time for creditors to verify reported indices and prepare disclosures.\n\nA look-back period of 45 days likely provides ample time for a creditor to determine a loan's new interest rate and \nprovide disclosures at least 60 days before payment at a new level is due, as discussed above. Are there reasons \nwhy a look-back period of forty-five days is not feasible for certain loan types for which a shorter look-back period is \ncommon, for example, subordinate-lien loans? Also, where an interest rate and payment adjustment is due to the \nconversion of an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage under a written agreement, should creditors \ncontinue to be required to provide an adjustment notice at least 25, rather than at least 60, days before payment at \na new level is due?\n\nCoverage. Section 226.20(c) currently applies to transactions subject to \u00a7 226.19(b), which applies to closed-end \nARMs secured by a consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year. The Board is proposing to \napply \u00a7 226.19(b) to all closed-end ARMs secured by real property or a dwelling, as discussed above. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.20(c) would apply to the same category of transactions.\n\nThe Board recognizes that currently creditors need not provide ARM adjustment notices under existing \u00a7 226.20(c) \nfor a short-term transaction, such as a construction loan, with an adjustable rate. The Board solicits comment on \nwhether a 60-day notice period is appropriate for such loans and if not, what period would be appropriate and still \nprovide consumers sufficient notice of a payment change.\n\nExisting ARM loan agreements. The Board is aware that some ARM loan agreements may provide for a look-back \nperiod that is too short for the creditor to be able to provide an adjustment notice at least 60 days before payment at \na new level is due. The Board seeks comment on the number or proportion of existing ARM loan agreements under \nwhich creditors or servicers could not comply with a minimum 60-day advance notice requirement.\n\n20(c)(2)(i)\n\nWhere a payment change accompanies an interest rate change, proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(i) requires creditors to \ndisclose a statement that changes are being made to the interest rate and the date such change is effective. \nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(i) also requires creditors to state that more detailed information is available in the loan \nagreements. Proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(ii) requires that these disclosures appear before the other required \ndisclosures, as discussed below.\n\n20(c)(2)(ii)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(ii) requires creditors to provide the following disclosures for covered loans in the form of a \ntable: (1) The current and new interest rates; (2) if payments are interest-only or negatively amortizing, the amount \nof the current and new payment allocated to pay interest, principal, and property taxes and mortgage-related \n\n\n\ninsurance, as applicable; and (3) the current and new periodic payment amounts and the due date for the first new \npayment. This content is substantially similar to the content of the \"Payment Summary\" table in the TILA \ndisclosures provided before consummation for most types of ARMs. (Under proposed \u00a7 226.38, the \"Payment \nSummary\" table for negatively amortizing ARMs differs from the \"Payment Summary\" table for other ARMs, as \ndiscussed below.) Under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(iii), this table would have to contain headings, content, and \nformat substantially similar to those in Appendix H--4(G), as discussed below.\n\nCurrently, ARM adjustment notices need not state how payments are allocated among principal, interest, and \nescrow accounts. The Board believes that a table showing payment allocations would benefit consumers with \ninterest-only or negatively amortizing loans. Participants in the Board's consumer testing generally understood a \nsample form with a table showing the transition from interest-only payments to payments of both principal and \ninterest. Further, all participants correctly identified the new payment and the due date of the first payment at the \nnew level shown in the table. Almost all participants recognized the increase in the interest rate and amounts \nescrowed for taxes and property-related insurance and that part of the new payment would be allocated to pay \nprincipal.\n\nComment 20(c)(1)-1 on disclosing \"current\" and \"prior\" interest rates would be revised for clarity to refer instead to \n\"current\" and \"new\" interest rates. Under the proposed rule, \u00a7 226.20(c)(3) contains content requirements for \nannual notice disclosures and \u00a7 226.20(c)(2) contains content requirements for payment change notices. \nAccordingly, commentary on disclosure where no payment change has occurred during a year would be removed \nfrom comment 20(c)(1)-1.\n\n20(c)(2)(iii)\n\nCreditors currently must disclose the index values upon which the prior and new interest rates are based, under \nexisting \u00a7 226.19(c)(2). Some consumer testing participants had difficulty understanding the relationship among an \nindex, a margin, and an interest rate. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(iii) substitutes a requirement that \ndisclosures contain a description of the change in the index or formula for the disclosure required under existing \u00a7 \n226.20(c)(2). For example, rather than disclose that payments previously were based on a 1-year LIBOR rate of \n3.75 and now would be based on a new rate of 5.75, a creditor might disclose the following: \"Your interest rate will \nchange due to an increase in the 1-year LIBOR index.\" Further, proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(iii) requires creditors to \ndisclose any application of previously foregone increases together with the description of the change in the index or \nformula.\n\nA simple statement of the occurrence that caused the interest rate and payment to change likely conveys a level of \ninformation suitable for most consumers' needs. In consumer testing conducted for the Board, participants indicated \nthat they found explanations of interest rates difficult to follow. Thus, providing more information would likely result \nin information overload. Consumers who prefer more information can review the loan agreement to determine the \ninteraction between the interest rate and the index and margin or to learn more about the formula used to determine \nthe interest rate. The loan agreement also will contain information about how the creditor may apply previously \nforegone interest. For these reasons, proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(ii) does not require creditors to disclose the current \nand prior index values. Comment 20(c)(2)-1 would be removed accordingly.\n\nComment 20(c)(4)-1, which discusses the types of contractual effects \u00a7 226.20(c) requires creditors to disclose--for \nexample, effects on the loan term and balance--also would be removed under the proposed rule. Proposed \ncomments 20(c)(2)(vi)-2, 20(c)(2)(vii)-1, and 20(c)(3)(v)-1 reflect the removed commentary, however.\n\n20(c)(2)(iv)\n\nExisting \u00a7 226.20(c)(3) requires that a creditor disclose the extent to which the creditor has foregone any increase \nin the interest rate. This requirement would be redesignated as proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(iv). Further, proposed \u00a7 \n226.20(c)(iv) would require creditors to disclose the earliest date a creditor may apply foregone interest to future \nadjustments, subject to any rate caps. Proposed comment 20(c)(3)(iv)-1 states that creditors may rely on proposed \n\n\n\ncomment 20(c)(2)(iv)-1 in determining to which transactions the requirement to disclose foregone interest applies \nand how to disclose such increases. Proposed comment 20(c)(3)(iv)-1 clarifies that creditors need not disclose the \nearliest date the creditor may apply foregone interest in notices provided annually when no payment change occurs \nduring a year.\n\n20(c)(2)(v)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(v) would require creditors to disclose limits on interest rate or payment increases at each \nadjustment, if any, and the maximum interest rate or payment over the life of the loan. This is consistent with the \ndisclosure of rate change limits in the \"More Information about Your Payments\" section of the disclosures provided \nwithin three business days of application. See proposed \u00a7 226.38(e).\n\n20(c)(2)(vi)\n\nCurrently, where the required loan payment is different from the payment disclosed under \u00a7 226.20(c)(4), \u00a7 \n226.20(c)(5) requires a creditor to disclose the payment required to fully amortize the loan over the remainder of the \nloan term. This requirement would be redesignated as proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(vi). Further, in all cases creditors \nwould disclose a statement regarding whether or not part of the new payment will be allocated to pay the loan \nprincipal. This is consistent with the focus on the impact of loan payments on loan principal in the proposed new \n\"Key Questions\" disclosure in \u00a7 226.19(c) and the \"Key Questions about Risk\" section of the disclosure creditors \nprovide within three business days of application in proposed \u00a7 226.38(d).\n\nExisting comment 20(c)(5)-1, on fully amortizing payments, would be redesignated as comment 20(c)(2)(vi)-1. The \ncomment also would be revised for clarity and to update cross-references. Consistent with existing comment \n20(c)(4)-1, proposed comment 20(c)(2)(vi)-2 clarifies that the creditor must disclose any change in the term or \nmaturity of the loan if the change resulted from the rate adjustment.\n\n20(c)(2)(vii)\n\nExisting \u00a7 226.20(c)(4) requires creditors to disclose the loan balance. This requirement would be redesignated as \nproposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(vii) and would require creditors to disclose the loan balance as of the effective date of the \ninterest rate adjustment. Proposed comment 20(c)(2)(vii)-1 clarifies that the balance required to be disclosed is the \nbalance on which the new adjusted payment is based. This is consistent with existing comment 20(c)(4)-1.\n\n20(c)(3) Content of Annual Interest Rate Notice\n\nExisting \u00a7 226.20(c) requires creditors to provide ARM adjustment notices at least once each year during which an \ninterest rate adjustment is implemented without an accompanying payment change. This requirement would be \nredesignated as proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3). Currently, \u00a7 226.20(c) contains a single list of required disclosures \ncreditors must provide as applicable, in a payment change notice and an annual notice of interest rate changes \nwithout payment changes. Proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3) specifies the disclosures that are applicable for purposes of \nannual notices.\n\n20(c)(3)(i)\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(i), where no payment adjustment has been made during a year, the creditor must \ndisclose that the interest rate on the loan has changed without changing the payments the consumer must make. \nFurther, proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(i) requires creditors to disclose the specific time period for which the annual notice \ndiscloses interest rates that were not accompanied by payment changes. Proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(ii) requires that \nthis disclosure appear before the other required disclosures, as discussed below.\n\n\n\n20(c)(3)(ii)\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(ii), a creditor must disclose the highest and lowest interest rates applied during the \nyear in which no payment change has accompanied interest rate changes. Creditors would not disclose all interest \nrates applied to a transaction if the payment has not changed. By contrast, existing comment 20(c)-1 provides that \ncreditors either may disclose all interest rates that applied or the highest and lowest rates. The Board believes that \na simple and clear disclosure of the highest and lowest interest rates applied better conveys to consumers the \nimpact of interest rate changes than does a list of all of the interest rates applied. This is especially true where \ninterest rates change more frequently than monthly.\n\n20(c)(3)(iii)\n\nCreditors disclose the extent to which the creditor has foregone any increase in the interest rate under existing \u00a7 \n226.20(c)(3). This requirement would be contained in proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(iii) for notices where payment \nchanges do not accompany interest rate changes made during a year.\n\n20(c)(3)(iv)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(iv) requires creditors to disclose the maximum interest rate that may apply over the life of \nthe loan. This is consistent with the disclosure of rate change limits in the \"More Information about Your Payments\" \nsection of the disclosures provided within three business days of application in proposed \u00a7 226.38(e).\n\n20(c)(3)(v)\n\nExisting \u00a7 226.20(c)(4) requires creditors to disclose the loan balance. Under the proposal, this requirement would \nbe contained in proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(v) for purposes of annual notices where payment changes do not \naccompany interest rate changes. Creditors would disclose the loan balance as of the last date of the year covered \nby the disclosure. Proposed comment 20(c)(3)(v)-1 clarifies that the balance required to be disclosed is the balance \non which the new adjusted payment is based. This is consistent with existing comment 20(c)(4)-1.\n\n20(c)(4) Additional Information\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4) requires that ARM adjustment notices creditors provide information about prepayment \npenalties, contacting the creditor, and locating housing counseling resources. Proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(ii) requires \nthat these additional disclosures be located directly below the required interest rate disclosures, as discussed \nbelow.\n\n20(c)(4)(i)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4)(i) requires creditors to disclose the last date the creditor may impose a penalty if the \nconsumer prepays the obligation in full and the amount of the maximum penalty possible before that date, if \napplicable. Under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4)(i), if an ARM has a prepayment penalty, the creditor must disclose the \nrequired information whether or not a payment change accompanies the interest rate change. The Board believes \nthat disclosures regarding a prepayment penalty would assist consumers in determining when to seek a refinance \nloan. When presented with a sample ARM adjustment notice for a loan with a prepayment penalty, almost all \nconsumer testing participants recognized that a prepayment penalty would apply if they obtained a refinance loan \nbefore a specified date.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4)(i) provides that the creditor shall disclose the maximum prepayment penalty possible if the \nconsumer prepays in full between the date the creditor delivers or mails the ARM adjustment notice and the last day \nthe creditor may impose the penalty. The Board requests comment on whether creditors should determine the \n\n\n\nmaximum prepayment penalty during some other period, for example between the date the creditor prepares the \nARM adjustment notice and the last day the creditor may impose the penalty.\n\n20(c)(4)(ii)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4)(ii) requires creditors to disclose a phone number to call for additional information about the \nconsumer's loan. Creditors must provide this information whether or not a payment change accompanies an \ninterest rate change, under the proposed rule. Most consumer testing participants responded positively to tested \ndisclosures stating how to contact their lender with questions and stated that they would call their lender if they \nrealized they were unable to afford higher payments on an ARM.\n\n20(c)(4)(iii)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4)(iii) requires creditors to disclose a phone number and an Internet Web site consumers \nmay use to obtain a list of HUD-licensed housing counselors. The proposed rule requires creditors to provide this \ndisclosure whether or not a payment change accompanies an interest rate change. Most consumer testing \nparticipants thought that information about how to locate a HUD-licensed housing counselor would be useful to \nconsumers. Some said that they would use the information themselves if they had difficulty affording payments.\n\n20(c)(5) Format of Disclosures\n\n20(c)(5)(i)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(i) requires that the heading, content, and format of the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.20(c) \nbe substantially similar to the heading, content, and format of the model form in Appendix H-4(G), where an interest \nrate adjustment is accompanied by a payment change, or the model form in Appendix H-4(K), where a creditor \nprovides an annual notice of interest rate adjustments without an accompanying payment change. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.20(c)(5)(i) also requires that the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.20(c) be placed in a prominent location. \n(Comment 37(d)-1 states that disclosures meet the prominent location standard if they are located on the first page \nand on the front side of the disclosure statement.)\n\nFurther, under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(i) the interest rate disclosures required by \u00a7 226.20(c)(2) (where a payment \nchange accompanies an interest rate change) or \u00a7 226.20(c)(3) (where no payment change occurs during a year) \nmust be grouped together with the additional disclosures on prepayment penalties, contacting the creditor or \nservicer for loan information, and locating housing counseling resources required by proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4). \nThese grouped disclosures must be segregated from everything else.\n\n20(c)(5)(ii)\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(ii), the statement that changes are being made to the interest rate and payments \n(under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(i)) or that the interest rate has changed without accompanying payments changes \n(under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(i)) must precede the other required disclosures. The additional disclosures on \ninformation on prepayment penalties, contacting the creditor, and housing counseling resources required by \nproposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(4) must follow the interest rate disclosures, under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(ii).\n\n20(c)(5)(iii)\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(5)(iii), where a payment change accompanies an interest rate adjustment, the interest \nrate and payment change disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(ii) must contain headings, content, and \nformat substantially similar to those in the table contained in Appendix H-4(G). The textual disclosures required by \n\n\n\nproposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(iii) through (vii) must be located directly below the table. Further, the format requirements \nin \u00a7 226.37 apply to ARM adjustment notices, as discussed below.\n\nRegulations of other agencies.\n\nFootnote 45c to \u00a7 226.20(c) currently states that creditors may substitute information provided in accordance with \nvariable-rate subsequent disclosure regulations of other federal agencies for the disclosure required by \u00a7 226.20(c). \nThe Board adopted footnote 45c in 1987, a time when OCC, FHLBB, and HUD regulations contained subsequent \ndisclosure requirements for ARMs. See 52 FR 48665, 48671; Dec. 24, 1987. The proposed rule would remove \nfootnote 45c. No comprehensive disclosure requirements for variable-rate mortgage transactions presently are in \neffect under the regulations of the other Federal financial institution supervisory agencies, as discussed above.\n\n20(d) Periodic Statement for Negative Amortization Loans\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors to provide periodic statements for payment option ARMs with a negative \namortization feature that are secured by real property or a dwelling. Such ARMs permit consumers to choose the \namount paid (above a specified minimum) each period. In 2006, the Board, the OCC, the OTS, the FDIC, and the \nNCUA expressed concerns about consumer understanding of how such loans function and of the effect of negative \namortization on a loan's balance in the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks issued in \n2006. 71 FR 58609; October 4, 2006. The agencies issued related sample illustrations that include a payment \nsummary table showing the impact of various payment options on the loan balance that creditors may include with \nperiodic statements for payment option ARMs. 72 FR 31825, 31831; Jun. 8, 2007. The illustrations were not \nconsumer-tested. The Board's proposed model table showing payment options is similar to the summary table the \nagencies issued but has been revised based on consumer testing.\n\nPayment option ARMs are complex products. Most participants in the Board's consumer testing were unfamiliar \nwith such loans and with negative amortization generally. These loans present consumers with choices each \nmonth, and how the consumer exercises his or her choice may result in negative amortization and much higher \npayments when the consumer must begin to make fully amortizing payments or a balloon payment. The Board \nbelieves that consumers should be informed of the consequences of making minimum payments on such a loan. \nThus, the Board proposes to require creditors to provide a periodic statement that describes a consumer's payment \noptions and the effects of making payments in those amounts. 45\n\n20(d)(1) Timing and Content of Disclosures\n\nFor closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling that permit the consumer to select among \nmultiple payment options that include an option that results in negative amortization, proposed \u00a7 226.20(d) requires \ncreditors to provide a periodic statement that discloses payment options not later than fifteen business days before \n\n45 The Federal financial institution supervisory agencies (the Board, the OCC, the OTS, the FDIC, and the NCUA (collectively, \nthe agencies)) expressed concerns about consumer understanding of how such loans function and of the effect of negative \namortization on a loan's balance in the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks issued in 2006. 71 FR \n58609; October 4, 2006. The agencies issued related sample illustrations that include a payment summary table showing the \nimpact of various payment options on the loan balance that creditors may include with periodic statements for payment option \nARMs. 72 FR 31825, 31831; Jun. 8, 2007. Proposed \u00a7 226.20(d) requires creditors to provide periodic statements that disclose \npayment options in the form of a table. The proposed model table is similar to the summary table the agencies issued but has \nbeen revised based on consumer testing.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\na payment is due. Where payment at a new level is due, however, proposed \u00a7 226.20(c) requires creditors to \nprovide an ARM adjustment notice no later than 60 days beforehand, as discussed above.\n\n20(d)(1)(i) Payment\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(d)(1)(i) would require creditors to disclose, based on the interest rate in effect at the time the \ndisclosure is made, the payment amount required to: (1) Pay off the loan balance in full by the end of the term \nthrough regular periodic payments, without a balloon payment; (2) prevent negative amortization, if the legal \nobligation explicitly permits the consumer to elect to pay interest only without paying principal; and (3) pay the \nminimum payment required under the legal obligation. Under the proposed rule, creditors would provide each \ndisclosure as applicable. For example, if the terms of the loan obligation did not provide the option for consumers to \nmake interest-only payments, creditors would disclose only the required minimum payment and the fully amortizing \npayment.\n\nIn consumer testing conducted for the Board, participants generally understood the options presented in the table. \nMost were able to understand that making the minimum required payment would cause their loan balance to grow. \nThey also understood that making a fully amortizing payment would be a safe choice and would pay their loan \nbalance off over time.\n\nProposed comment 20(d)(1)-1 clarifies that creditors must provide a summary table under \u00a7 226.20(d) for covered \nloans that allow a consumer to choose to make a payment that results in negative amortization even if the initial \npayments required do not negatively amortize the loan. Proposed comment 20(d)(1)-1 states that a payment \nsummary table need only contain those disclosures that apply to payment options available to a consumer, \nhowever. For example, the proposed comment states that if a negatively amortizing loan recasts and a consumer \nmust begin to make fully amortizing payments, the payment summary table need not disclose payments other than \nthe fully amortizing payment.\n\nProposed comment 20(d)(1)-2 states that creditors may base all disclosures on the assumption that payments will \nbe made on time and in the amounts required by the terms of the legal obligation, disregarding any possible \ninaccuracies resulting from consumers' payment patterns. This is consistent with existing comment 17(c)(2)(i)-3 and \nproposed revisions to comment 17(c)(1)-1, discussed above. Proposed comment 20(d)(1)-2 clarifies, however, that \ncreditors may not base disclosures for loans with a negatively amortizing feature on the fully amortizing, interest-\nonly, or other payment unless that payment is the amount the consumer is required to pay under the legal \nobligation. Finally, proposed comment 20(d)(1)(i)-1 states that creditors may rely on comment 38(c)(5)-1 to \ndetermine whether a payment is a regular periodic payment or a balloon payment.\n\n20(d)(1)(ii) Effects\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(d)(1)(ii) requires creditors to disclose the effects of making payments in the amounts required to \nbe disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.20(d). Appendix H-4(L) contains a proposed model form with accessible \nlanguage on fully amortizing payments, interest-only payments, and negatively amortizing minimum payments. \nFirst, the model form states that a fully amortizing payment will cover all the interest owed in a particular payment \nplus some principal and decrease the loan balance and that if the consumer regularly makes the fully amortizing \npayment the consumer will pay off the loan on schedule. Second, the model form states that an interest-only \npayment will cover all the interest owed in a particular payment but none of the principal, that the consumer's \nbalance will remain the same, and that if the consumer regularly makes interest-only payments the consumer will \nhave to make larger payments as early as a specified date. Third, the model form states that a minimum payment \nwill cover only part of the interest owed in a particular payment and result in a specified amount of unpaid interest \nbeing added to the loan balance and that if the consumer makes a minimum payment the consumer in effect will be \nborrowing more money and will lose home equity. Further, the model form states that if a consumer regularly makes \nminimum payments the consumer will have to make significantly larger payments as early as a specified date.\n\n\n\nProposed comment 20(d)(1)(ii)-1 states that the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.20(d) must be consistent with the \nterms of the legal obligation. For example, the proposed comment clarifies that disclosures may not state that \nmaking fully amortizing payments on an interest-only loan will reduce a consumer's loan balance if the creditor will \nnot apply payments that exceed the interest-only payment to principal.\n\n20(d)(1)(iii) Unpaid Interest\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(d)(1)(iii) requires creditors to disclose the amount that will be added to the loan balance due to \nunpaid interest, if the consumer elects to make a payment that results in negative amortization.\n\n20(d)(2) Format of Disclosures\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(d)(2)(i) requires that periodic statements for loans with a negative amortization feature contain \npayment disclosures with content substantially similar to the content of Form H-4(L) in Appendix H. Further, the \nproposed provision requires creditors to make payment disclosures in a payment summary table with headings, \ncontent, and format substantially similar to Form H-4(L). Proposed \u00a7 226.20(d)(2)(ii) requires that disclosures be \nplaced in a prominent location (that is, located on the first page and on the front side of the disclosure statement, as \nclarified by proposed comment 37(d)(1)-1), with one exception. Under proposed \u00a7 226.20(d)(2)(ii), if the payment \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.20(d) are made together with the ARM adjustment disclosures required by \u00a7 \n226.20(c), the payment disclosures must be located directly below the ARM adjustment disclosures.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(d)(2)(iii) requires that the table required by \u00a7 226.20(d)(2)(i) contain only the information \nrequired by \u00a7 226.20(d)(1). Other information may be presented with the table under the proposed rule, provided \nthat such information appears outside of the required table.\n\nAlternatives not proposed. The Board is proposing to apply the requirement to provide periodic statements that \ncontain a payment summary table, for payment option ARMs with a negative amortization feature that are secured \nby real property or a dwelling. The Board considered requiring periodic statements for all loans secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. The Board is not proposing such a requirement, however. It is not clear that a monthly \nstatement on a fixed-rate mortgage or an ARM without payment options would provide sufficient benefits to \nconsumers to offset the costs of providing statements. For these loans, the consumer cannot exercise any choice in \npayments. Moreover, creditors must give borrowers advance notice each time the required payment for a variable-\nrate transaction adjusts, under \u00a7 226.20(c), as discussed above. Servicers send borrowers with escrow accounts \nannual statements under RESPA. Some servicers send additional escrow notices more frequently, for example \nquarterly. Those statements assist consumers in monitoring account changes related to changes in taxes or \nproperty insurance costs.\n\n20(e) Creditor-Placed Property Insurance\n\nCreditor-placed property insurance requirements. The security instrument or promissory note typically contains a \nrequirement that the consumer maintain insurance on the property securing the loan, such as the consumer's \ndwelling or automobile. If the consumer fails to maintain the insurance or the insurance is cancelled, the credit \nagreement typically authorizes the creditor to obtain such insurance at the consumer's expense. The premium \nbecomes additional debt of the consumer. This practice is known as \"creditor-placed property insurance.\"\n\nIndustry reports indicate that the volume of creditor-placed property insurance premiums has increased significantly \nin the past few years. 46 Consumers struggling financially may fail to pay required property insurance premiums \nunaware that the creditor has the right to obtain such insurance on their behalf and add the premiums to the \n\n46 See, e.g., Consumer Credit Industry Association, Fact Book of Credit-Related Insurance at 1 (2007) (finding that the 2007 \nvolume of creditor-placed property insurance premiums was over twice the 2002 amount).\n\n\n\noutstanding loan balance. 47 In some instances, creditors have improperly obtained property insurance when they \narguably knew or should have known that the consumer already had insurance. 48 Generally, creditor-placed \ninsurance is more costly and provides less coverage than insurance that a consumer purchases through an \ninsurance agent. 49\n\nCurrently, there is no provision in Regulation Z or federal law that requires the creditor to provide notice of the cost \nto the consumer before charging the consumer for creditor-placed property insurance. It appears that only a few \nstates require creditors to provide notice, and these requirements differ. Under Michigan law, for example, a creditor \nmay not impose charges on a debtor for creditor-placed property insurance unless the creditor provides two notices \nand allows the borrower a total of 30 days to provide evidence of insurance. 50 New Mexico law, on the other hand, \nsimply requires the insurer to provide notice to the debtor within 15 days after the placement or renewal of creditor-\nplaced property insurance. 51 The majority of states have no notice requirement. The servicing guidelines of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac also vary greatly. Fannie Mae's guidelines state that the servicer \"should\" provide the \nborrower with at least one written notice and a total of at least 60 days to provide evidence of insurance before \ncharging for creditor-placed property insurance. 52 Freddie Mac's guidelines do not require the servicer to provide \nnotice to the borrower. 53\n\nIn order to ensure that consumers are informed of the cost of creditor-placed property insurance, the Board \nproposes to use its authority under TILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), to add \u00a7 226.20(e) to require the \ncreditor to provide notice of the cost and coverage of creditor-placed property insurance before charging the \nconsumer for such insurance. In addition, proposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(4) would require the creditor to provide the \n\n47 See State of Wisconsin, Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, \"Force-Placed\" Insurance Surprises Those Who Let Policies \nLapse (May 30, 2002) available at http://oci.wi.gov/pressrel/0502home.htm  (\"Many people don't realize that if they let that \n[homeowner's] insurance lapse, banks and other lenders can legally re-insure their home loan by buying insurance to replace it \nand making the homebuyer pay for it.\").\n\n48 See, e.g., United States of America v. Fairbanks Capital Corp., Civ. Action No. 03-12219-DPW, Complaint at P 17 (D. Mass. \nNov. 12, 2003) (finding that Fairbanks improperly obtained property insurance when it knew or should have known that \nborrowers already had insurance); Ocwen Federal Bank FSB, OTS Docket No. 04592, Supervisory Agreement, OTS Docket No. \n04592 (Apr. 19, 2004) (requiring the bank to take reasonable actions to determine whether appropriate hazard insurance is \nalready in place before it obtained creditor-placed property insurance).\n\n49 See, e.g., Webb, et al. v.

LEXIS 42559, at *15 (S.D. \nOhio May 28, 2008) (finding that the creditor-placed property insurance premium was four times higher than the plaintiff's original \npremium and did not cover personal property or provide coverage for personal liability or medical payments to others).\n\n \n\n \n\n50 Mich.

Proposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(1) would define \"creditor-placed property insurance\" as \"property insurance \ncoverage obtained by the creditor when the property insurance required by the credit agreement has lapsed.\" \nSection 226.20(e) would apply to secured closed-end loans, including mortgage and automobile loans. The Board \nsolicits comment as to whether this rule should also apply to HELOCs.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(2) contains three conditions for charging for creditor-placed property insurance. First, \nproposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(2)(i) would require the creditor to make a reasonable determination that the required property \ninsurance had lapsed. Second, proposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(2)(ii) would require the creditor to mail or deliver to the \nconsumer a written notice containing the information required by the proposed rule at least 45 days before a charge \nis imposed on the consumer for the creditor-placed property insurance. Finally, proposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(2)(iii) would \npermit the creditor to charge the consumer if, during the 45-day notice period, the consumer did not provide the \ncreditor with evidence of adequate property insurance.\n\nNotice period timing and charges.\nUnder the proposed rule, the creditor would have to mail or deliver to the consumer the required written notice at \nleast 45 days before charging the consumer for the cost of creditor-placed property insurance. This 45-day notice \nperiod is consistent with the 45-day notice period required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 Section \n102(e), 42 U.S.C. 4012a(e), and represents the midpoint between State law 30-day notice periods 54 and the 60-\nday Fannie Mae Servicing Guide recommendation. 55 The Board notes that the provision in the Fannie Mae \nServicing Guide is stated as a recommendation, but not a requirement. The Board believes that a 45-day notice \nperiod would allow the consumer reasonable time to shop for and provide evidence of insurance. The Board \nrecognizes that it may take several days for the consumer to receive a notice sent by mail, but the consumer would \nstill have at least one calendar month in which to shop for and purchase property insurance. Comment is solicited, \nhowever, on whether a different time period would better serve the needs of consumers and creditors.\n\nProposed comment 20(e)-1 would make clear that if the creditor complies with \u00a7 226.20(e), the creditor could \ncharge the consumer for creditor-placed insurance as of the 46th day after sending the notice to the consumer. For \nexample, a creditor that mails the required notice on January 2, 2011, may begin to charge the consumer for the \ncost of the creditor-placed property insurance on February 18, 2011. Proposed comment 20(e)-1 would also clarify \nthat the creditor may charge the consumer for the cost of any required property insurance obtained during the 45-\nday notice period if such charge is not prohibited by applicable State or other law.\n\nContent and format of notice.\nProposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(3) would require the creditor to provide the written notice clearly and conspicuously. \nProposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(3)(i) would require that the notice contain the creditor's name and contact information, the \nloan number, and the address or description of the property securing the credit transaction. The Board solicits \ncomment as to whether the creditor should be required to establish a local or toll-free telephone number for the \nconsumer to contact the creditor.\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.20(e)(ii)-(viii), the notice would also need to contain the following statements: (1) That the \nconsumer is obligated to maintain insurance on the property securing the credit transaction; (2) that the required \nproperty insurance has lapsed; (3) that the creditor is authorized to obtain the property insurance on the consumer's \n\n54 See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 23-101-113 (2008); Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 500.1625 (2009); Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 83-54-25 (2008); Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 56-49-113 (2009).\n\n55 Fannie Mae Single-Family Servicing Guide, Part II, Ch. 6 Lender-Placed Property Insurance (2005).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nbehalf; (4) the date the creditor can charge the consumer for the cost of the creditor-placed property insurance; (5) \nhow the consumer may provide evidence of property insurance; (6) the cost of the creditor-placed property \ninsurance stated as an annual premium, and that this premium is likely significantly higher than a premium for \nproperty insurance purchased by the consumer; and (7) that the creditor-placed insurance may not provide as much \ncoverage as homeowner's insurance. The Board solicits comment on whether the notice should also contain \nstatements, if applicable, that the creditor will receive compensation for obtaining creditor-placed property insurance \nand that the creditor will establish an escrow account to pay for the creditor-placed insurance premium. Although \nsuch statements would be informative, the Board is concerned that providing these additional disclosures could \nresult in information overload for the consumer. A Model Clause is proposed at Appendix H-18.\n\nThe Board proposes to use its authority under TILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), to add \u00a7 226.20(e) to \nrequire the creditor to provide notice before charging the consumer for the cost of creditor-placed property \ninsurance. TILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), authorizes the Board to prescribe regulations to carry out the \npurposes of the act. TILA's purpose includes promoting \"the informed use of credit,\" which \"results from an \nawareness of the cost thereof by consumers.\" TILA Section 102(a), 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). Currently, few consumers \nare aware of the cost or coverage of creditor-placed property insurance, or that the premiums become additional \ndebt of the consumer. The Board believes that this proposed rule would inform consumers of the cost and coverage \nof the creditor-placed property insurance and avoid the uninformed use of credit. In addition, this proposed rule \nwould not prohibit the creditor from charging for creditor-placed property insurance, but would simply delay the \ncharge until the consumer has been provided sufficient notice of the cost and sufficient time to shop for his or her \nown homeowner's insurance.\n\nSection 226.25 Record Retention\n\n25(a) General Rule\n\nSection 226.25(a) provides that creditors must retain records to evidence compliance with Regulation Z for two \nyears. As discussed in detail below, the Board is proposing to add a new comment to \u00a7 226.25(a) to provide \nguidance on record retention requirements relating to proposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), which would prohibit any person \nfrom paying compensation to a loan originator based on any of the terms or conditions of the transaction. Proposed \ncomment 25(a)-5 would provide that, to evidence compliance with proposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), a creditor must retain \nfor each covered transaction a record of the agreement between it and the loan originator that governs the \noriginator's compensation and a record of the amount of compensation actually paid to the originator in connection \nwith the transaction.\n\nSection 226.27 Language of Disclosures\n\nCurrently, \u00a7 226.27, permits TILA disclosures in a language other than English as long as the disclosures are \nprovided in English upon the consumer's request. Many consumers do not speak English or speak English as a \nsecond language. According to the 2000 Census, at least 18% of the population (47 million people) speak a \nlanguage other than English at home. 56 To protect non-native English speakers from fraud and discrimination in \ncredit transactions, recent enforcement actions have required that creditors or mortgage brokers provide \ntranslations of presentations, disclosures, or documents. 57 Moreover, several states have enacted laws to require \n\n56 U.S. Census Bureau,Language Use and English-Speaking Ability: 2000 at 2 (Oct. 2003), available at \nhttp://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-29.pdf .\n\n57 See, e.g., In the Matter of First Mariner Bank, Baltimore, Maryland, FDIC-07-285b, FDIC-08-358k, Consent Agreement at 5 \n(April 22, 2009) (alleging that the bank discriminated against Hispanics, African-Americans, and women by charging them higher \nprices for residential mortgage loans and requiring the bank to provide financial literacy courses in English and Spanish); Fed. \n\nhttp://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-29.pdf\n\n\ncredit disclosures or documents in Spanish or other foreign languages. 58 In 2006, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nannounced the availability of non-executable Spanish translations of the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform \nInstrument to help the residential mortgage industry better serve Spanish-speaking consumers. 59 Finally, Congress \nrecently asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a study examining the relationship between fluency in \nEnglish and financial literacy, and the extent, if any, to which individuals whose native language is not English are \nimpeded in the conduct of their financial affairs. 60\n\nConsumer advocates are concerned that consumers who do not speak English or speak English as a second \nlanguage may be more susceptible to abusive credit practices or offered less favorable credit terms or products \nbecause they are not provided with disclosures they can understand. Industry representatives, on the other hand, \nraise concerns about the cost and burden of translating documents into multiple foreign languages and the potential \nliability for inaccurate translations. Both consumer advocates and industry representatives question whether \nconsumers who speak minority languages will still have access to credit if creditors have to bear the cost and \nliability for translating documents into little-known languages. Creditors may be reluctant to engage in outreach to \nconsumers who speak those languages.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on whether it should use its rulemaking authority to require creditors to provide \ntranslations of credit disclosures. Comment is requested on whether the failure to provide credit disclosure \ntranslations is unfair or deceptive, or impedes the informed use of credit. Comment is also requested on potential \nlitigation issues, such as whether a translation would be admissible into evidence or whether an inaccurate \ntranslation would toll TILA's statute of limitations or extend the right of rescission. Finally, comment is requested on \nthe effectiveness of State laws that require translations of disclosures or documents and whether the Board should \nadopt similar regulations.\n\nThe Board requests comment on the following translation issues:\n\nTrade Comm'n v.

What is the scope of the problem? That is, approximately how many consumers do not understand TILA \ndisclosures because of language barriers?\n\n. Should creditors be required to provide consumers with translations of required TILA disclosures? If such \ntranslations were required, what should be the trigger for such disclosures (e.g., the language of the negotiation, the \nlanguage of the creditor's presentation, the language of the creditor's advertisement, a consumer request)?\n\n. Should there be an exception for consumers who are accompanied by an interpreter?\n\n. Would a translation requirement negatively affect consumers and the type and terms of credit offered because \ncreditors would be reluctant to risk liability for engaging in transactions in a language other than English?\n\nFinally, the Board solicits comment on the following coverage issues:\n\n. Should a translation requirement apply only to mortgages loans, or also to other types of credit products, such as \nauto loans or credit cards?\n\n. Should a translation requirement apply only to the TILA disclosures provided before or at consummation, or to any \ncredit disclosures or documents provided before, at, or subsequent to consummation?\n\n. Should a translation requirement apply to Web sites that provide early TILA disclosures?\n\n. Should a translation requirement apply only to one or a few languages, or should it apply to any foreign language?\n\nSection 226.32 Requirements for Certain Closed-End Mortgages\n\n32(b) Definitions\n\n32(b)(1)\n\nSection 226.32(b)(1) defines the \"point and fees\" used to determine whether a loan is a HOEPA loan. That \ndefinition consists of four elements: (i) All items required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.4(a) and 226.4(b), except \ninterest or the time-price differential; (ii) All compensation paid to mortgage brokers; (iii) All items listed in \u00a7 \n226.4(c)(7) (other than amounts held for future payment of taxes) unless the charge is reasonable, the creditor \nreceives no direct or indirect compensation in connection with the charge, and the charge is not paid to an affiliate \nof the creditor; and (iv) Premiums or other charges for credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance, or \ndebt-cancellation coverage (whether or not the debt-cancellation coverage is insurance under applicable law) that \nprovides for cancellation of all or part of the consumer's liability in the event of the loss of life, health, or income or in \nthe case of accident, written in connection with the credit transaction. In light of the changes to the finance charge \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.4, discussed above, the Board is proposing technical amendments to this provision.\n\nThe reference to \"items required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.4(a) and 226.4(b), except interest or the time-price \ndifferential\" in \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(i) implements TILA Section 103(aa)(4)(A). That provision includes in points and fees \n\"all items included in the finance charge, except interest or the time-price differential.\" 15 U.S.C. 1602(aa)(4)(A). \nThus, \"items required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.4(a) and 226.4(b)\" is intended to capture the finance charge. \nSection 226.32(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) parallel the additional elements in TILA Section 103(aa)(4)(B) and (C). See 15 \nU.S.C. 1602(aa)(4)(B) and (C). Finally, TILA Section 103(aa)(4)(D) provides for the inclusion of such other charges \nas the Board determines to be appropriate. 15 U.S.C. 1602(aa)(4)(D). Pursuant to that authority, in \u00a7 \n226.32(b)(1)(iv), the Board included credit insurance premiums and debt cancellation coverage fees. Thus, the \nstatutory definition reflects Congress's intent to include in points and fees mortgage broker compensation, certain \nreal-estate related fees, and the insurance charges added by the Board, even if those items would be excluded \nfrom the finance charge under other applicable rules.\n\n\n\nUnder TILA Section 103(aa)(1), HOEPA applies to certain transactions that are secured by a consumer's principal \ndwelling. 15 U.S.C. 1602(aa)(1). Proposed \u00a7 226.4(g), and therefore the more inclusive definition of finance charge \nit would create, would apply to any transaction secured by real property or a dwelling. Consequently, all loans that \nare potentially subject to HOEPA would be subject to the proposed \"but for\" finance charge definition. Under that \ndefinition, the items included under the points and fees definition in addition to the finance charge (other than \ninterest or the time-price differential) would never be excluded from the finance charge for transactions secured by \nreal property or a dwelling.\n\nThe Board believes that proposed \u00a7 226.4 would render \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(ii) through (iv) unnecessary because all \nitems included in points and fees under those provisions already would be included as part of the finance charge. \nTo eliminate unnecessary complexity, the Board proposes to streamline \u00a7 226.32(b)(1) by deleting those additional \nelements. The Board also proposes to revise \u00a7 226.32(b)(1) to provide that points and fees means all items \nincluded in the finance charge pursuant to \u00a7 226.4, except interest or the time-price differential, instead of \u00a7 \n226.32(b)(1)(i)'s reference to \"items required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.4(a) and 226.4(b).\" This change would \nreflect the language of TILA more closely and is not meant to effect any substantive change to HOEPA's coverage.\n\n32(c) Disclosures\n\n32(c)(1) Notices\n\nFor HOEPA loans, TILA Sections 129(a)(1)(A) and (B), 15 U.S.C. 1639(a)(1)(A) and (B), and \u00a7 226.32(c)(1), require \nthe creditor to provide the following disclosures in conspicuous type size: \"You are not required to complete this \nagreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application. If you obtain \nthis loan, the lender will have a mortgage on your home. You could lose your home, and any money you have put \ninto it, if you do not meet your obligations under the loan.\" The first sentence is a \"no obligation\" statement to \ninform the consumer that the space for the consumer's signature that may be on the credit application does not \nobligate the consumer to accept the terms of the loan. The next two sentences are \"security interest\" disclosures to \ninform the consumer of the potential consequences when the creditor takes a security interest in the consumer's \nhome. Comment 32(c)(1)-1 states that these disclosures need not be in a particular format or part of the note or \nmortgage document. A Model Clause is currently provided at Appendix H-16.\n\nAs discussed more fully in \u00a7 226.38(f)(1), the MDIA amended TILA Section 128(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2), to \nrequire the creditor to provide the following \"no obligation\" statement on the TILA disclosure: \"You are not required \nto complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or signed a loan application.\" \nBased on consumer testing, the Board proposes to use its adjustments and exception authority under TILA Section \n105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), to modify the specific wording on the disclosure. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(1) would require \nthe creditor to provide a statement that the consumer has no obligation to accept the loan, and, if the creditor \nprovides space for a consumer's signature, a statement that a signature by the consumer only confirms receipt of \nthe disclosure statement. During consumer testing, participants' comprehension improved when they reviewed the \nplain-language version of the clause.\n\nSimilarly, based on consumer testing, the Board proposes to use its adjustments and exception authority under \nTILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), to require the creditor under proposed \u00a7 226.32(c)(1) to provide the \nfollowing \"no obligation\" statement in connection with a HOEPA loan: \"You have no obligation to accept this loan. \nYour signature below only confirms that you have received this form.\" TILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), \nstates that the Board \"may provide for such adjustments * * * as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or \nproper to effectuate the purposes of [TILA]\". One of the purposes of TILA is to promote the informed use of credit. \nTILA Section 102(a), 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). Consumer testing showed that the \"no obligation\" language improved \nparticipants' understanding of the key point that signing or accepting a disclosure did not obligate the consumer to \naccept the terms of the loan.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to use its adjustments and exception authority under TILA Section 105(a), 15 \nU.S.C. 1604(a), to require the creditor under proposed \u00a7 226.32(c)(1) to provide the following \"security interest\" \nstatement in connection with a HOEPA loan: \"If you are unable to make the payments on this loan, you could lose \nyour home.\" As discussed more fully in \u00a7 226.38(f)(2), consumer testing showed that participant comprehension of \nthis disclosure improved when the plain-language version of the \"security interest\" disclosure was used. The Board \nbelieves that the plain-language versions of the \"no obligation\" and \"security interest\" disclosures will better inform \nconsumers who are considering obtaining HOEPA loans.\n\nThe proposal would delete comment 32(c)(1)-1 and require these statements to be in bold text and a minimum 10-\npoint font, consistent with proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.37 and 226.38. A revised Model Clause is proposed at Appendix H-16.\n\n32(c)(5) Amount Borrowed\n\nFor HOEPA mortgage refinancing loans, \u00a7 226.32(c)(5) requires the creditor to disclose the amount borrowed, and \nstates that \"where the amount borrowed includes premiums or other charges for optional credit insurance or debt-\ncancellation coverage, that fact shall be stated, grouped together with the disclosure of the amount borrowed.\" In \nthe December 2008 Open-End Final Rule, the existing rules for credit insurance and debt cancellation coverage \nwere applied to debt suspension coverage for purposes of excluding a charge for debt suspension coverage from \nthe finance charge. See 74 FR 5244, 5255; Jan. 29, 2009. In the final rule, the Board stated that \"[d]ebt cancellation \ncoverage and debt suspension coverage are fundamentally similar to the extent they offer a consumer the ability to \npay in advance for the right to reduce the consumer's obligations under the plan on the occurrence of specified \nevents that could impair the consumer's ability to satisfy those obligations.\" 74 FR 5266. The Board also noted that \nthe two products are different because debt cancellation coverage cancels the debt while debt suspension merely \nsuspends payment of the debt. Id. Despite this difference, the Board adopted a final rule treating the two products \nthe same for purposes of the finance charge, but adding a special disclosure warning consumers of the risks of debt \nsuspension coverage. Id. Consistent with this approach, the Board proposes to treat debt suspension coverage in \nthe same manner as debt cancellation coverage for purposes of the disclosing the amount borrowed for a HOEPA \nmortgage refinancing loan. The Board proposes to revise \u00a7 226.32(c)(5) to clarify that where the amount borrowed \nincludes charges for debt suspension coverage, that fact should be stated, grouped together with the disclosure of \nthe amount borrowed. Proposed comment 32(c)(5)-1 would also be revised to include a reference to debt \nsuspension coverage. Comment is solicited on this approach.\n\nSection 226.35 Prohibited Acts or Practices in Connection With Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans\n\n35(a) Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans\n\n35(a)(2)\n\nIn its final rule implementing new requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, 73 FR 44522; July 30, 2008, the \nBoard adopted the \"average prime offer rate\" as the benchmark for coverage of new \u00a7 226.35. In so doing, the \nBoard adopted commentary under new \u00a7 226.35(a)(2) regarding the calculation of the average prime offer rate and \nrelated guidance. Comment 35(a)(2)-4 indicated that the Board publishes average prime offer rates and the \nmethodology for their calculation on the Internet. The Board is proposing to amend comment 35(a)(2)-4 to specify \nwhere on the Internet the table and methodology may be found (http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda).\n\nThe Board also is proposing new comment 35(a)(2)-5 to provide additional guidance on determination of applicable \naverage prime offer rates for purposes of \u00a7 226.35. The comment would clarify that the average prime offer rate is \ndefined identically under \u00a7 226.35 and under Regulation C (HMDA), 12 CFR 203.4(a)(12)(ii). Thus, for purposes of \nboth coverage of \u00a7 226.35 and coverage of the rate spread reporting requirement under Regulation C, 12 CFR \n203.4(a)(12)(i), the applicable average prime offer rate is identical. The comment would clarify further that guidance \non the applicable average prime offer rate is provided in the staff commentary under Regulation C, the Board's A \n\n\n\nGuide to HMDA Reporting: Getting it Right!, and the relevant \"Frequently Asked Questions\" on HMDA compliance \nposted on the FFIEC's Web site referenced above.\n\nSection 226.36 Prohibited Acts or Practices in Connection With Credit Secured by Real Property or a Consumer's \nDwelling\n\nThe Board proposes to amend \u00a7 226.36 to extend the scope of the section's coverage to all closed-end \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Currently, this section applies to closed-end credit transactions \nsecured by a consumer's principal dwelling. As revised, \u00a7 226.36 would apply to closed-end transactions secured \nby any dwelling, not just a consumer's principal dwelling. This approach would be consistent with recent \namendments to the TILA effected by the MDIA.\n\n36(a) Loan Originator and Mortgage Broker Defined\n\nAs discussed below in more detail, the Board proposes to prohibit certain payments to loan originators that are \nbased on a transaction's terms and conditions, and also proposes to prohibit loan originators from \"steering\" \nconsumers to transactions that are not in their interest in order to increase the originator's compensation. \nAccordingly, the Board proposes to amend the regulation to provide a definition of \"loan originator\" in \u00a7 \n226.36(a)(1), which would include persons who are covered by the current definition of mortgage broker but also \nwould include employees of the creditor, who are not considered \"mortgage brokers.\" Existing \u00a7 226.36(a) defines \nthe term \"mortgage broker\" because mortgage brokers are subject to the prohibition on coercion of appraisers in \u00a7 \n226.36(b). A revised definition of mortgage broker would be designated as \u00a7 226.36(a)(2). The provision of existing \n\u00a7 226.36(a) stating that a creditor making a \"table funded\" transaction is considered a mortgage broker would be \nrevised for clarity; no substantive change is intended other than the expansion of the definition from mortgage \nbroker to loan originator. Thus, under proposed \u00a7 226.36(a)(1), a creditor that does not provide the funds for the \ntransaction at consummation out of its own resources, out of deposits held by it, or by drawing on a bona fide \nwarehouse line of credit would be considered a loan originator for purposes of \u00a7 226.36.\n\n36(b) and (c) Misrepresentation of Value of Consumer's Dwelling; Servicing Practices\n\nThe Board proposes to amend \u00a7 226.36(b) and (c) to reflect the expanded scope of coverage of \u00a7 226.36, as noted \nabove. Existing \u00a7 226.36(b) prohibits creditors and mortgage brokers and their affiliates from coercing, influencing, \nor otherwise encouraging appraisers to misstate or misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling in \nconnection with a closed-end mortgage transaction. Section 226.36(c) currently prohibits certain practices of \nservicers of closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. Under this \nproposal, the rules relating to appraiser coercion and loan servicing would apply to all closed-end transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling, for the reasons discussed above.\n\n36(d) Prohibited Payments to Loan Originators\n\nThe Board is proposing to use its authority in HOEPA to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in mortgage \nlending to restrict certain practices related to the payment of loan originators. See TILA Section 129(l)(2)(A), 15 \nU.S.C. 1639(l)(2)(A). For this purpose, a \"loan originator\" includes both mortgage brokers and employees of \ncreditors who perform loan origination functions.\n\nSpecifically, to address the potential unfairness that can arise with certain loan originator compensation practices, \nthe proposed rule would prohibit a creditor or other party from paying compensation to a loan originator based on \nthe credit transaction's terms or conditions. This prohibition would not apply to payments that consumers make \ndirectly to a loan originator. However, if a consumer directly pays the loan originator, the proposed rule would \nprohibit the originator from also receiving compensation from any other party in connection with that transaction.\n\n\n\nThe Board is soliciting comment on an alternative that would allow loan originators to receive payments that are \nbased on the principal loan amount, which is a common practice today. The Board is also soliciting comment on \nwhether it should adopt a rule that seeks to prohibit loan originators from directing or \"steering\" consumers to loans \nbased on the fact that the originator will receive additional compensation, unless that loan is in the consumer's \ninterest. The Board is expressly soliciting comment on whether the rule would be effective in achieving the stated \npurpose. Comment is also solicited on the feasibility and practicality of such a rule, its enforceability, and any \nunintended adverse effects the rule might have. These proposals and alternatives are discussed more fully below.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the summer of 2006, the Board held public hearings on home equity lending in four cities. During the hearings, \nconsumer advocates urged the Board to ban \"yield spread premiums,\" payments that mortgage brokers receive \nfrom the creditor at closing for delivering a loan with an interest rate that is higher than the creditor's \"buy rate.\" The \nconsumer advocates asserted that yield spread premiums provide brokers an incentive to increase consumers' \ninterest rates unnecessarily. They argued that a prohibition would align reality with consumers' perception that \nbrokers serve consumers' best interests.\n\nIn light of the information received at the 2006 hearings and the rise in defaults that began soon after, the Board \nheld an additional hearing in June of 2007 to explore how it could use its authority under HOEPA to prevent \nabusive lending practices in the subprime mortgage market while still preserving responsible lending. Although the \nBoard did not expressly solicit comment on mortgage broker compensation in its notice of the June 2007 hearing, a \nnumber of commenters and some hearing panelists raised the topic. Consumer and creditor representatives alike \nraised concerns about the fairness and transparency of creditors' payment of yield spread premiums to brokers. \nSeveral commenters and panelists stated that consumers are not aware of the payments creditors make to brokers, \nor that such payments increase consumers' interest rates. They also stated that consumers may mistakenly believe \nthat a broker seeks to obtain the best interest rate available. Consumer groups have expressed particular concern \nabout increased payments to brokers for delivering loans both with higher interest rates and prepayment penalties. \nConsumer groups suggested a variety of solutions, such as prohibiting creditors paying brokers yield spread \npremiums, imposing on brokers that accept yield spread premiums a fiduciary duty to consumers, imposing on \ncreditors that pay yield spread premiums liability for broker misconduct, or including yield spread premiums in the \npoints and fees test for loans subject to HOEPA. Several creditors and creditor trade associations advocated \nrequiring brokers to disclose whether the broker represents the consumer's interests, and how and by whom the \nbroker is to be compensated. Some of these commenters recommended that brokers be required to disclose their \ntotal compensation to the consumer and that creditors be prohibited from paying brokers more than the disclosed \namount.\n\nTo address these concerns, the Board's January 2008 proposed rule would have prohibited a creditor from paying a \nmortgage broker any compensation greater than the amount the consumer had previously agreed in writing that the \nbroker would receive. 73 FR 1672, 1698-1700; Jan. 9, 2008 (HOEPA proposal). In support of the rule, the Board \nexplained its concerns about yield spread premiums, which are summarized below.\n\nA yield spread premium is the present dollar value of the difference between the lowest interest rate the wholesale \nlender would have accepted on a particular transaction and the interest rate the broker actually obtained for the \nlender. This dollar amount is usually paid to the mortgage broker, though it may also be applied to reduce the \nconsumer's upfront closing costs. The creditor's payment to the broker based on the interest rate is an alternative to \nthe consumer paying the broker directly from the consumer's preexisting resources or from loan proceeds. \nPreexisting resources or loan proceeds may not be sufficient to cover the broker's total fee, or may appear to the \nconsumer to be a more costly way to finance those costs if the consumer expects to prepay the loan in a relatively \nshort period. Thus, consumers potentially benefit from having an option to pay brokers for their services indirectly \nby accepting a higher interest rate.\n\nThe Board shares concerns, however, that creditors' payments to mortgage brokers are not transparent to \nconsumers and are potentially unfair to them. Creditor payments to brokers based on the interest rate give brokers \n\n\n\nan incentive to provide consumers loans with higher interest rates. Some brokers may refrain from acting on this \nincentive out of legal, business, or ethical considerations. Moreover, competition in the mortgage loan market may \noften limit brokers' ability to act on the incentive. The market often leaves brokers room to act on the incentive \nshould they choose, however, especially as to consumers who are less sophisticated and less likely to shop among \neither loans or brokers.\n\nLarge numbers of consumers are simply not aware the incentive exists. Many consumers do not know that creditors \npay brokers based on the interest rate, and the current legally required disclosures seem to have only limited effect. \nSome consumers may not even know that creditors pay brokers: A common broker practice of charging a small part \nof its compensation directly to the consumer, to be paid from the consumer's existing resources or loan proceeds, \nmay lead consumers to believe, incorrectly, that this amount is all the consumer will pay or that the broker will \nreceive. Consumers who do understand that the creditor pays the broker based on the interest rate may not fully \nunderstand the implications of the practice. They may not appreciate the full extent of the incentive the practice \ngives the broker to increase the rate because they do not know the dollar amount of the creditor's payment.\n\nMoreover, consumers often wrongly believe that brokers have agreed, or are required, to obtain the best interest \nrate available. Several commenters in connection with the 2006 hearings suggested that mortgage broker \nmarketing cultivates an image of the broker as a \"trusted advisor\" to the consumer. Consumers who have this \nperception may rely heavily on a broker's advice, and there is some evidence that such reliance is common. In a \n2003 survey of older borrowers who had obtained prime or subprime refinancings, majorities of respondents with \nrefinance loans obtained through both brokers and creditors' employees reported that they had relied \"a lot\" on their \nloan originators to find the best mortgage for them. 61 The Board's recent consumer testing also suggests that \nmany consumers shop little for mortgages and often rely on one broker or lender because of their trust in the \nrelationship.\n\nIf consumers believe that brokers protect consumers' interests by shopping for the lowest rates available, then \nconsumers will be less likely to take steps to protect their interests when dealing with brokers. For example, they \nmay be less likely to shop rates across retail and wholesale channels simultaneously to assure themselves the \nbroker is providing a competitive rate. They may also be less likely to shop and negotiate brokers' services, \nobligations, or compensation upfront, or at all. For example, they may be less likely to seek out brokers who will \npromise in writing to obtain the lowest rate available.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the 2008 HOEPA proposal would have prohibited a creditor from paying a broker \nmore than the consumer agreed in writing to pay. Under the proposal, the consumer and mortgage broker would \nhave had to enter into a written agreement before the broker accepted the consumer's loan application and before \nthe consumer paid any fee in connection with the transaction (other than a fee for obtaining a credit report). The \nagreement also would have disclosed (i) that the consumer ultimately would bear the cost of the entire \ncompensation even if the creditor paid part of it directly; and (ii) that a creditor's payment to a broker could influence \nthe broker to offer the consumer loan terms or products that would not be in the consumer's interest or the most \nfavorable the consumer could obtain.\n\nBased on the Board's analysis of comments received on the HOEPA proposal, the results of consumer testing, and \nother information, the Board withdrew the proposed provisions relating to broker compensation. 73 FR 44522, \n\n61 See Kellie K. Kim-Sung & Sharon Hermanson, Experiences of Older Refinance Mortgage Loan Borrowers: Broker- and \nLender-Originated Loans, Data Digest No. 83 (AARP Public Policy Inst., Washington, DC, Jan. 2003, at 3, available at \nhttp://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/post-import/dd83_loans.pdf .\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/post-import/dd83_loans.pdf\n\n\n44563-65; July 30, 2008. The Board's withdrawal of those provisions was based on its concern that the proposed \nagreement and disclosures could confuse consumers and undermine their decision-making rather than improve it. \nThe risks of consumer confusion arose from two sources. First, an institution can act as either creditor or broker \ndepending on the transaction. At the time the agreement and disclosures would have been required, such an \ninstitution could be uncertain as to which role it ultimately would play. This could render the proposed disclosures \ninaccurate and misleading in some, and possibly many, cases. Second, the Board was concerned by the reactions \nof consumers who participated in one-on-one interviews about the proposed agreement and disclosures as part of \nthe Board's consumer testing. These consumers often concluded, not necessarily correctly, that brokers are more \nexpensive than creditors. Many also believed that brokers would serve their best interests notwithstanding the \nconflict resulting from the relationship between interest rates and brokers' compensation. 62 The proposed \ndisclosures presented a significant risk of misleading consumers regarding both the relative costs of brokers and \nlenders and the role of brokers in their transactions.\n\nIn withdrawing the broker compensation provisions of the HOEPA proposal, the Board stated it would continue to \nexplore options to address potential unfairness associated with loan originator compensation arrangements, such \nas yield spread premiums. The Board indicated it would consider whether disclosures or other approaches could \neffectively remedy this potential unfairness without imposing unintended consequences.\n\nPotential for Unfairness in Loan Originator Compensation Practices\n\nAs noted above, the Board is now proposing rules to prohibit certain practices relating to payments made to \ncompensate mortgage brokers and other loan originators. These rules would be adopted pursuant to the Board's \nauthority under HOEPA, as contained in TILA Section 129(l), which authorizes the Board to prohibit acts or practice \nin connection with mortgage loans that the Board finds to be unfair or deceptive. As discussed in part IV above, in \nconsidering whether a practice is unfair or deceptive under TILA Section 129(l), the Board has generally relied on \nthe standards that have been adopted for purposes of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a), which also \nprohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices.\n\nFor purposes of the FTC Act, an act or practice is considered unfair when it causes or is likely to cause substantial \ninjury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by \ncountervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. As explained below, the practice of basing a loan \noriginator's compensation on the credit transaction's terms or conditions appears to meet these standards and \nconstitute an unfair practice. Furthermore, based on its experience with consumer testing, particularly in connection \nwith the HOEPA proposal, the Board believes that disclosure alone would be insufficient for most consumers to \navoid the harm caused by this practice. Thus, the Board is proposing a rule that would remedy the practice through \nsubstantive regulations that prohibit particular practices.\n\nSpecifically, under proposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), compensation payments made to a mortgage broker or any other loan \noriginator based on a mortgage transaction's terms or conditions would be prohibited. Unlike the 2008 HOEPA \nproposal, the rule would also apply to creditors' employees who originate loans. As noted above, such payments \nwhen made to a mortgage broker are commonly referred to as yield spread premiums. There are analogous \npayments made by creditors to their employees who originate loans at a higher interest rate than the minimum rate \nrequired by the creditor. This arrangement is frequently referred to as an \"overage.\" For convenience, the \n\n62 For more details on the consumer testing, see the report of the Board's contractor, Macro International, Inc.,Consumer Testing \nof Mortgage Broker Disclosures (July 10, 2008), available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714regzconstest.pdf .\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714regzconstest.pdf\n\n\ndiscussion below uses the term \"yield spread premium\" also to refer to these types of payments, which would be \ncovered by the proposed rule as well.\n\nSubstantial injury. When loan originators receive compensation based on a transaction's terms and conditions, they \nhave an incentive to provide consumers loans with higher interest rates or other less favorable terms. Yield spread \npremiums, therefore, present a significant risk of economic injury to consumers. Currently, such injury is common \nbecause consumers typically are not aware of the practice or do not understand its implications and cannot \neffectively negotiate its use.\n\nCreditors' payments to mortgage brokers or their own employees that originate loans (\"loan officers\") generally are \nnot transparent to consumers. Brokers may impose a direct fee on the consumer which may lead consumers to \nbelieve that this is the sole source of the broker's compensation. While consumers expect the creditor to \ncompensate its own loan officers, they do not necessarily understand that the loan originator may have the ability to \nincrease the creditor's interest rate or include certain loan terms for the originator's own gain.\n\nTo guard effectively against this practice, a consumer would have to know the lowest interest rate the creditor would \nhave accepted to ascertain that the offered interest rate represents a rate increase by the loan originator. Most \nconsumers will not know the lowest rate the creditor would be willing to accept. The consumer also would need to \nunderstand the dollar amount of the yield spread premium that is generated by the rate increase to determine what \nportion, if any, is being applied to reduce the consumer's upfront loan charges. Although HUD recently adopted \ndisclosures in Regulation X, implementing RESPA, that could enhance some consumers' understanding of \nmortgage broker compensation, the details of the compensation arrangements are complex and the disclosures are \nlimited. A creditor may show the yield spread premium as a credit to the borrower that is applied to cover upfront \ncosts, but is also permitted to add the amount of the yield spread to the total origination charges being disclosed. \nThis would not necessarily inform the consumer that the rate has been increased by the originator and that a lower \nrate with a smaller origination charge was also available. In addition, the Regulation X disclosure concerning yield \nspread premiums would not apply to overages occurring when the loan originator is employed by the creditor. Thus, \nthe Regulation X disclosure, while perhaps an improvement over previous rules, is not likely by itself to prevent \nconsumers from incurring substantial injury from the practice.\n\nBecause consumers generally do not understand the yield spread premium mechanism, they are unable to engage \nin effective negotiation. Instead they are more likely to rely on the loan originator's advice and frequently obtain a \nhigher rate or other unfavorable terms solely because of greater originator compensation. These consumers suffer \nsubstantial injury by incurring greater costs for mortgage credit than they would otherwise be required to pay.\n\nInjury not reasonably avoidable. Yield spread premiums create a conflict of interest between the loan originator and \nconsumer. As noted above, many consumers are not aware of creditor payments to loan originators, especially in \nthe case of mortgage brokers, because these arrangements lack transparency. Although consumers may \nreasonably expect creditors to compensate their own employees, consumers do not know how the loan officer's \ncompensation is structured or that the loan officer can increase the creditor's interest rate or offer certain loan terms \nto increase their own compensation. Without this understanding, consumers cannot reasonably be expected to \nappreciate or avoid the risk of financial harm these arrangements represent.\n\nYield spread premiums are complex and may be counter-intuitive even to well-informed consumers. Based on the \nBoard's experience with consumer testing, the Board believes that disclosures are insufficient to overcome the gap \nin consumer comprehension regarding this critical aspect of the transaction. Currently, the required disclosures of \noriginator compensation under federal and State laws seem to have little, if any, effect on originators' incentive to \nprovide consumers with increased interest rates or other unfavorable loan terms, such as a prepayment penalty, \nthat can increase the originator's compensation. 63 The Board's consumer testing, discussed above, supported the \n\n63 Creditors may be willing to offer a loan with a lower interest rate in return for including a prepayment penalty. A loan originator \nthat offers a loan with a prepayment penalty might not offer the lower rate, resulting in a premium interest rate and the payment \nof a yield spread premium.\n\n\n\nfinding that disclosures about yield spread premiums are ineffective; consumers in these tests did not understand \nyield spread premiums and did not grasp how they create an incentive for loan originators to increase consumers' \ncosts.\n\nConsumers' lack of comprehension of yield spread premiums is compounded where the originator also imposes a \ndirect charge on the consumer. A mortgage broker might charge the consumer a direct fee, for example $ 500, for \narranging the consumer's mortgage loan. This charge encourages consumers to infer that the broker accepts the \nconsumer-paid fee to represent the consumer's financial interests. Consumers may believe that the fee they pay is \nthe originator's sole compensation. This may lead reasonable consumers to believe, erroneously, that loan \noriginators are working on their behalf and are under a legal or ethical obligation to help consumers obtain the most \nfavorable loan terms and conditions. There is evidence that consumers often regard loan originators as \"trusted \nadvisors\" or \"hired experts\" and consequently rely on originators' advice. Consumers who regard loan originators in \nthis manner are far less likely to shop or negotiate to assure themselves that they are being offered competitive \nmortgage terms. Even for consumers who shop, the lack of transparency in originator compensation arrangements \nmakes it unlikely consumers will avoid yield spread premiums that unnecessarily increase the cost of their loan.\n\nConsumers generally lack expertise in complex mortgage transactions because they engage in such mortgage \ntransactions infrequently. Their reliance on the loan originator is reasonable in light of the originator's greater \nexperience and professional training in the area, the belief that originators are working on their behalf, and the \napparent ineffectiveness of disclosures to dispel that belief.\n\nInjury not outweighed by benefits to consumers or to competition. Yield spread premiums can represent a potential \nconsumer benefit in cases where the amount is applied to reduce consumers' upfront closing costs, including \noriginator compensation. A creditor's increase in the interest rate (or the addition of other loan terms) may be used \nto generate additional income that the creditor uses to compensate the originator, in lieu of adding origination points \nor fees that the consumer would be required to pay directly from the consumer's preexisting funds or the loan \nproceeds. This can benefit a consumer who lacks the resources to pay closing costs in cash, or who might have \ninsufficient equity in the property to increase the loan amount to cover these costs. Further, some consumers prefer \nto fund closing costs, including origination fees, through a higher rate if the consumer expects to own the property \nor have the loan for a relatively short period, for example, less than five years. For those consumers who \nunderstand this trade-off there could be potential benefits. In such cases, however, the yield spread premium does \nnot increase the amount of compensation paid by the creditor to the originator, who would receive the same amount \nwhether the loan has a higher rate or a lower rate accompanied by higher upfront fees.\n\nNevertheless, without a clear understanding of yield spread premiums or effective disclosure, the majority of \nconsumers are not equipped to police the market to ensure that yield spread premiums are in fact applied to reduce \ntheir closing costs, especially in the case of loan originator compensation. This would be particularly difficult \nbecause consumers are not likely to have any basis for determining a \"typical\" or \"reasonable\" amount for originator \ncompensation. Accordingly, the Board is proposing a rule that prohibits any person from basing a loan originator's \ncompensation on the loan's rate or terms but still affords creditors the flexibility to structure loan pricing to preserve \nthe potential consumer benefit of compensating an originator through the interest rate.\n\nThe Board's Proposal\n\nUnder \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), the Board proposes to prohibit any person from compensating a loan originator, directly or \nindirectly, based on the terms or conditions of a loan transaction secured by real property or a dwelling. This \nprohibition would apply to any person, rather than only a creditor, to prevent evasion by structuring loan originator \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\npayments through non-creditors. For example, secondary market investors that purchase closed loans from \ncreditors would not be permitted to pay compensation to loan originators that is based on the terms or conditions of \ntheir transactions.\n\nUnder the proposal, compensation that is based on the loan amount would be considered a payment that is based \non a term or condition of the loan. The prohibition would not apply to consumers' direct payments to loan \noriginators. Under \u00a7 226.36(d)(2), however, if the consumer compensates the loan originator directly, the originator \nwould be prohibited from receiving compensation from the creditor or any other person.\n\nBecause the loan originator could not receive compensation based on the interest rate or other terms, the originator \nwould have no incentive to alter the terms made available by the creditor to deliver a more expensive loan. For \nexample, a company acting as a mortgage broker could not provide greater compensation to its employee acting as \nthe loan originator for a transaction with a 7 percent interest rate than for a transaction with a 6 percent interest rate. \nA creditor would be under the same restriction in compensating its loan officer. For this purpose, the term \n\"compensation\" would not be limited to commissions, but would include salaries or any financial incentive that is \ntied to the transaction's terms or conditions, including annual or periodic bonuses or awards of merchandise or \nother prizes. See proposed comment 36(d)(1)-1.\n\nProposed comment 36(d)(1)-2 provides examples of compensation that is based on the transaction's terms or \nconditions, such as payments that are based on the interest rate, annual percentage rate, or the existence of a \nprepayment penalty. Examples of loan originator compensation that is not based on the transaction's terms or \nconditions are listed in proposed comment 36(d)(1)-3. These include compensation based on the originator's loan \nvolume, the performance of loans delivered by the originator, or hourly wages.\n\nThe Board recognizes that loans originators may need to expend more time and resources in originating loans for \nconsumers with limited or blemished credit histories. Because such loans are likely to carry higher rates, originators \ncurrently rely on higher yield spread premiums to compensate them for the additional time and efforts. Paying an \noriginator based on the time expended would be permissible under the proposed rule.\n\nAlthough the proposed rule would not prohibit a creditor from basing compensation on the originator's loan volume, \nsuch arrangements may raise concerns about whether it creates incentives for originators to deliver loans without \nproper regard for the credit risks involved. The Board expects creditors to exercise due diligence to monitor and \nmanage such risks. Financial institution regulators generally will examine creditors they supervise to ensure they \nhave systems in place to exercise such due diligence.\n\nThe proposed rule also would not prohibit compensation that differs by geographical area, but any such \narrangements must comply with other applicable laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691-\n1691f) and Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619). See proposed comment 36(d)(1)-4. Creditors that use \ngeography as a criterion for setting originator compensation would need to be able to demonstrate that this reflects \nlegitimate differences in the costs of origination and in the levels of competition for originators' services.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, creditors also may compensate their own loan officers differently than mortgage brokers. \nFor instance, in light of the fact that mortgage brokers relieve creditors of certain overhead costs of loan \noriginations, a creditor might pay brokers more than its own loan officers. Likewise, a creditor might pay one loan \noriginator of either type more than it pays another, as long as each originator receives compensation that is not \nbased on the terms of the transactions they deliver to the creditor.\n\nScope of coverage. The Board believes that the proposed rule should apply to creditors' employees who originate \nloans in addition to mortgage brokers. A creditor's loan officers frequently have the same discretion over loan \npricing that mortgage brokers have to modify a loan's terms to increase their compensation, and there is evidence \n\n\n\nsuggesting that loan officers engage in such practices. 64 Accordingly, the coverage of \u00a7 226.36(d)(1) is broader \nthan the 2008 HOEPA proposal, which covered only mortgage brokers. Some commenters on the HOEPA proposal \nexpressed concern that it would create an \"unlevel playing field\" by creating an unfair advantage for creditors that \nwould not have to comply with the same requirements as brokers.\n\nThe proposed rule would apply to covered transactions whether or not they are higher-priced mortgage loans. A \nloan originator's financial incentive to deliver less favorable loan terms to a consumer could result in consumer \ninjury whether or not the loan has a rate above the coverage threshold in \u00a7 226.35. The risks of harm could be \nreduced in the lower-priced segment of the market, however, where consumers historically have more choices. \nComment is solicited on the relative costs and benefits of applying the rule to all segments of the market, and \nwhether the costs would outweigh the benefits for loans below the higher-priced mortgage loan threshold.\n\nCreditors' pricing flexibility. The proposed rule would not affect creditors' flexibility in setting rates or other loan \nterms. The rule does not limit the creditor's ability to adjust the loan terms it offers to consumers as a means of \nfinancing costs the consumer would otherwise be obligated to pay directly (in cash or out of the loan proceeds), \nincluding the originator's compensation, provided this does not affect the amount the originator receives for the \ntransaction. Thus, a creditor could recoup costs by adding to the loan pricing terms an origination point (calculated \nas one percentage point of the loan amount) even though the creditor could not pay the originator's compensation \non that basis. Similarly, a creditor could add a constant premium of, for instance, 1/4 of one percent to the interest \nrates on all transactions for which the creditor will pay compensation to the loan originator, as a means of recouping \nthe cost of the originator's compensation. The creditor would not recoup the same dollar amount in each \ntransaction, however, because the present value of the premium in dollars would vary with the loan amount. \nConsequently, even though loan pricing could be set in this manner, this method could not be used to set the loan \noriginator's compensation. See proposed comment 36(d)(1)-5.\n\nEffect of modification of loan terms. The proposed rule is designed to prevent consumers from being harmed by \nloan originators making unfavorable modifications to loan terms, such as increasing the interest rate, to increase the \noriginator's compensation. Currently, loan originators might also exercise discretion to make modifications in the \nconsumer's favor. For example, to retain the consumer's business, today a loan originator might agree with the \nconsumer to reduce the amount the consumer must pay in origination points on the loan, which would be funded by \na reduction in the amount the originator receives from the creditor as compensation for delivering the loan. Under \nthe proposed rule, however, a creditor would not be permitted to reduce the amount it pays to the loan originator \nbased on such a change in loan terms. As a result, the reduction in origination points would be a cost borne by the \ncreditor.\n\nThus, when the creditor offers to extend a loan with specified terms and conditions (such as the rate and points), \nthe amount of the originator's compensation for that transaction is not subject to change, through either an increase \nor a decrease, even if different loan terms are negotiated. If this were not the case, a creditor generally could agree \n\n64 For example, the Federal Trade Commission's settlement with Gateway Funding, Inc. in December 2008 illustrates a case \nwhere a creditor's loan officers created \"overages,\" although the primary legal theory concerned disparate treatment by race in \nthe imposition of overages. The FTC's complaint and the court's final judgment and order can be found on the FTC's web-site \nathttp://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623063/index.shtm . The FTC has since filed a complaint alleging similar patterns of overages \nin violation of fair lending laws, against Golden Empire Mortgage, Inc. The May 2009 complaint can be found at \nhttp://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623061/090511gemcmpt.pdf . A similar pattern of overages was alleged in legal actions brought \nby the Department of Justice (DOJ), which resulted in settlement agreements with Huntington Mortgage Company (1995) and \nFleet Mortgage Corp. (1996).\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623063/index.shtm\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623061/090511gemcmpt.pdf\n\n\nto compensate originators at a high level and then subsequently lower the compensation only in selective cases, \nsuch as when the consumer obtains a competing offer with a lower interest rate. This would have the same effect \nas increasing the originator's compensation for higher rate loans. Proposed comment 36(d)(1)-6 would address this \nissue.\n\nPeriodic changes in loan originator compensation. Under proposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(1) a creditor would not be \nprevented from periodically revising the compensation it agrees to pay a loan originator. However, a creditor may \nnot revise a loan originator's compensation arrangement in connection with each transaction. This guidance is \nreflected in proposed comment 36(d)(1)-7. The revised compensation arrangement must result in payments to the \nloan originator that are not based on the terms or conditions of a credit transaction. A creditor might periodically \nreview factors such as loan performance, transaction volume, as well as current market conditions for originator \ncompensation, and prospectively revise the compensation it agrees to pay to a loan originator. For example, \nassume that during the first six months of the year, a creditor pays $ 3,000 to a particular loan originator for each \nloan delivered, regardless of the loan terms. After considering the volume of business produced by that originator, \nthe creditor could decide that as of July 1, it will pay $ 3,250 for each loan delivered by that originator, regardless of \nthe loan terms. The change in compensation would not be a violation even if the loans made by the creditor after \nJuly 1 generally carry higher interest rates than loans made before that date.\n\nAlternative to permit compensation based on loan amount. The Board is also publishing for comment a proposed \nalternative that would allow loan originator compensation to be based on the loan amount, which would not be \nconsidered a transaction term or condition for purposes of the prohibition in \u00a7 226.36(d)(1). Currently, the \ncompensation received by many mortgage originators is structured as a percentage of the loan amount. Other \nparticipants in the mortgage market, such as creditors, mortgage insurers, and other service providers, also receive \ncompensation based on the loan amount. The Board is therefore seeking comment on whether prohibiting \noriginator compensation on this basis might be unduly restrictive and unnecessary to achieve the purposes of the \nproposed rule.\n\nOn the other hand, prohibiting compensation based on the loan amount would eliminate an incentive for the \noriginator to steer consumers to a larger loan amount. Such steering maximizes the originator's compensation but \nalso increases the transaction's loan-to-value ratio and decreases the consumer's equity in the property. If the loan-\nto-value ratio increases sufficiently, the consumer may incur additional costs in the form of a higher interest rate or \nadditional points and fees, including the cost of mortgage insurance premiums. Because the consumer's monthly \npayment would also be larger, the originator might direct the consumer to riskier loan products that have discounted \ninitial rates but are subject to significant payment increases after the introductory period expires.\n\nBecause of the foregoing concerns, the Board is publishing two alternative versions of proposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(1). \nThe first alternative would consider the loan amount as a term or condition of the loan, thereby prohibiting the \npayment of originator compensation as a percentage of the loan amount. The second alternative provides that the \nloan amount is not a term or condition of the loan, and would permit such payments. The second alternative would \nbe accompanied by proposed comment 36(d)(1)-10 to provide further guidance. Under proposed comment \n36(d)(1)-10, a loan originator could be paid a fixed percentage of the loan amount even though the dollar amount \npaid by a particular creditor would vary from transaction to transaction and would increase as the loan amount \nincreases. Comment 36(d)(1)-10 also permits compensation paid as a fixed percentage of the loan amount to be \nsubject to a specified minimum or maximum dollar amount. For example, a loan originator's compensation could be \nset at one percent of the principal loan amount but not less than $ 1,000 or greater than $ 5,000.\n\nThe Board seeks comment on the two alternatives. Further, if the final rule permits compensation based on the loan \namount, should creditors be permitted to apply different percentages to loans of different amounts? Should creditors \nbe allowed to pay a larger percentage for smaller loan amounts, which could be an incentive to originate loans in \nlower-priced neighborhoods that ensures that the originator receives an amount that is comparable to loans \noriginated in high-priced neighborhoods? If so, should creditors also be permitted to pay originators a higher \npercentage for larger loan amounts?\n\n\n\nProhibition of compensation from both the consumer and another source. Proposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(2) would provide \nthat, if a loan originator is compensated directly by the consumer for a transaction secured by real property or a \ndwelling, no other person may pay any compensation to the originator for that transaction. Direct compensation \npaid by a consumer to a loan originator would not be limited to \"origination fees,\" \"broker fees,\" or similarly labeled \ncharges. Rather, compensation for this purpose includes any payment by the consumer that is retained by the loan \noriginator. Thus, a creditor that is a loan originator by virtue of making a table funded transaction, as discussed \nabove, would be subject to this prohibition if it imposes and retains any direct charge on the consumer for the \ntransaction.\n\nConsumers reasonably may believe that when they pay a loan originator directly, that amount is the only \ncompensation the originator will receive. As discussed above, consumers generally are not aware of creditor \npayments to originators. If the consumer were aware of such payments, the consumer might reasonably expect that \nmaking a direct payment to an originator would reduce or eliminate the need for the creditor to fund the originator's \ncompensation through the consumer's interest rate. Because the consumer is unaware of yield spread premiums, \nhowever, the consumer cannot effectively negotiate the originator's compensation. In fact, if consumers pay loan \noriginators directly and creditors also pay originators through higher rates, consumers may be injured by unwittingly \npaying originators more in total compensation (directly and through the rate) than consumers believe they agreed to \npay.\n\nThe Board believes that simply disclosing the yield spread premium would not address this injury to consumers. \nConsumer testing in connection with the Board's 2008 HOEPA Final Rule shows that, even with a disclosure, \nconsumers do not understand how a creditor payment to a loan originator can result in a higher interest rate for the \nconsumer. A disclosure therefore cannot inform consumers that they effectively are paying the loan originator more \nthan they believe they agreed to pay. Without that knowledge, consumers cannot take steps to protect their own \ninterests, such as by negotiating for a smaller direct payment, a lower rate, or both.\n\nThe Board also believes that this prohibition would increase transparency for consumers by requiring that all \noriginator compensation come from the creditor or from the consumer, but not both. This additional consequence of \nproposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(2) would reduce the total number of loan pricing variables with which the consumer must \ncontend. There is evidence that such simplification is consistent with TILA's purpose of promoting the informed use \nof consumer credit. 65 See TILA Section 102(a), 15 U.S.C. 1601(a).\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(2) would prohibit only payments to an originator that are made in connection with the \nparticular credit transaction, such as a commission for delivering the loan. The rule is not intended to prohibit \npayment of a salary to a loan originator who also receives direct compensation from a consumer in connection with \nthat consumer's transaction. This guidance is contained in proposed comment 36(d)(2)-1.\n\nRecord retention requirements. Creditors are required by \u00a7 226.25(a) to retain evidence of compliance with \nRegulation Z for two years. Proposed staff comment 25(a)-5 would be added to clarify that, to demonstrate \ncompliance with \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), a creditor must retain at least two types of records.\n\nFirst, a creditor must have a record of the compensation agreement with the loan originator that was in effect on the \ndate the transaction's rate was set. The Board believes this date is most likely when a loan originator's \ncompensation was determined for a given transaction. The Board seeks comment, however, on whether some \n\n65 See, e.g., Woodward, Susan E., A Study of Closing Costs for FHA Mortgages at 70-73 (Urban Institute and U.S. Department \nof Housing and Urban Development 2008), available at http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411682_fha_mortgages.pdf .\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411682_fha_mortgages.pdf\n\n\nother time would be more appropriate, in light of the purposes of the proposed rule. Proposed comment 25(a)-5 \nwould clarify that the rules in \u00a7 226.35(a) would govern in determining when a transaction's rate is set.\n\nSecond, proposed comment 25(a)-5 would state that a creditor must retain a record of the actual amount of \ncompensation it paid to a loan originator in connection with each covered transaction. The proposed comment \nwould clarify that, in the case of mortgage brokers, the HUD-1 settlement statement required under RESPA would \nbe an example of such a record because it itemizes the compensation received by a mortgage broker. The Board \nsolicits comment on whether any comparable record exists for loan officer compensation that should be referenced \nin proposed comment 25(a)-5. To facilitate compliance, a cross reference to the record retention requirement would \nbe included in proposed comment 36(d)(1)-9.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on whether there are other records that should be subject to the retention \nrequirements. The Board also seeks comment on whether the existing two-year record retention period is adequate \nfor purposes of the rules governing loan originator compensation.\n\nThe current record retention requirements in \u00a7 226.25 apply only to creditors. Although loan originator \ncompensation has historically been paid by creditors, the prohibitions in \u00a7 226.36(d) apply more broadly to any \nperson to prevent evasion by restructuring of payments through non-creditors. Accordingly, the Board expects that \npayments to loan originators will continue to be made largely by creditors. The Board seeks comment on whether \nthere is a need to adopt requirements for retaining records concerning originator compensation that would apply to \npersons other than creditors, including the relative costs and benefits of that approach.\n\n36(e) Prohibition on Steering\n\nOptional Proposal on Steering by Loan Originators\n\nThe Board is also soliciting comment on whether it should adopt a rule that seeks to prohibit loan originators from \ndirecting or \"steering\" consumers to loans based on the fact that the originator will receive additional compensation, \nwhen that loan may not be in the consumer's best interest. Under proposed \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), a loan originator would \nreceive the same compensation from a particular creditor regardless of the transaction's rate or terms. That \nprovision, however, would not prohibit a loan originator from directing a consumer to transactions from a single \ncreditor that offers greater compensation to the originator, while ignoring possible transactions having lower interest \nrates that are available from other creditors.\n\nAttempting to address this issue presents difficulties. Determining whether a loan originator was warranted in \ndirecting a consumer to a loan that resulted in greater compensation for the originator also involves a determination \nof whether that loan was in the consumer's best interest compared to other available loan products. There is, \nhowever, no uniform method for making that evaluation. Consumers and loan originators may choose from among \npossible loan offers for a variety of reasons. The annual percentage rate (APR) is a tool that facilitates comparison \nshopping among different loans, but it is imperfect for reasons that are well documented, including the fact that the \nAPR is calculated by amortizing origination fees over the full loan term rather than the expected life of the loan. See \nthe 1998 Joint Report to the Congress by the Board and HUD, cited above. In considering interest rates, consumers \nmay view the economic trade-off between rates and points differently depending on their individual financial \ncircumstances or the amount of time they expect to hold the loan. Moreover, consumers evaluate other factors in \ndeciding whether a loan is in their best interest even if it is not represented as the lowest cost option among the \npossible loan offers available through the originator. Thus, some consumers may reasonably determine that the \nfinancial risk created by a loan's prepayment penalty is acceptable in light of the loan's lower interest rate, while \nother consumers may prefer to accept a higher rate to avoid the risk. Consumers and loan originators also may \nconsider factors other than loan cost, such as the creditor's rate lock-in policies, or the creditor's reputation for \ndelivering loans within the promised time-frame, especially for home-purchase loans.\n\nThe Board believes, however, that there is benefit in attempting to craft a rule that prohibits and deters the most \negregious practices, even if such a rule cannot ensure that consumers always obtain the lowest cost loan. Under \n\n\n\nthe proposal, a loan originator would have a duty not to steer a consumer to higher cost loans that pay more to the \noriginator when the loan is not in the consumer's interest. Originators would violate the rule, for example, if they \ndirected the consumer to a fixed-rate loan option from a creditor that maximizes the originator's compensation \nwithout providing the consumer with an opportunity to choose from other available loans that have lower fixed \ninterest rates with the equivalent amount in origination and discount points.\n\nThe Board is publishing a proposal, designated as proposed \u00a7 226.36(e)(1), to reflect this optional approach. \nSpecifically, the rule would prohibit loan originators from directing or \"steering\" a consumer to consummate a \ntransaction secured by real property or a dwelling that is not in the consumer's interest, based on the fact that the \noriginator will receive greater compensation from the creditor in that transaction than in other transactions the \noriginator offered or could have offered to the consumer. The proposed rule seeks to preserve consumer choice by \nensuring that consumers have appropriate loan options that reflect considerations other than the maximum amount \nof compensation that will be paid to the originator. Proposed comments 36(e)(1)-1 through -3 would provide \nadditional guidance on the rule.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.36(e) would not require a loan originator to direct a consumer to the transaction that will result in \nthe least amount of compensation being paid to the originator by the creditor. However, if the loan originator \nreviews possible loan offers available from a significant number of the creditors with which the originator regularly \ndoes business and the originator directs the consumer to the transaction that will result in the least amount of \ncreditor-paid compensation, the requirements of \u00a7 226.36(e) would be deemed to be satisfied. See proposed \ncomment 36(e)(1)-2(ii).\n\nLoan originators employed by the creditor in a transaction would be prohibited under \u00a7 226.36(d)(1) from receiving \ncompensation based on the terms or conditions of the loan. Thus, when originating loans for the employer, the \noriginator could not steer the consumer to a particular loan to increase compensation. Accordingly, in those cases, \ntheir compliance with \u00a7 226.36(d)(1) would be deemed to satisfy the requirements of proposed \u00a7 226.36(e). See \nproposed comment 36(e)(1)-2(ii). A creditor's employee, however, occasionally might act as a broker in forwarding \na consumer's application to a creditor other than the originator's employer, such as when the employer does not \noffer any loan products for which the consumer would qualify. If the originator is compensated for arranging the loan \nwith the other creditor, the originator would not be an employee of the creditor in that transaction and would be \nsubject to proposed \u00a7 226.36(e).\n\nThe Board is also publishing provisions that would facilitate compliance with the prohibition in proposed \u00a7 \n226.36(e)(1). Under proposed \u00a7 226.36(e)(2) and (3), a safe harbor would be created, and there would be no \nviolation if the loan was chosen by the consumer from at least three loan options for each type of transaction (fixed-\nrate or adjustable-rate loan) in which the consumer expressed an interest, provided the following conditions are \nmet. The loan originator must obtain loan options from a significant number of creditors with which the originator \nregularly does business. For each type of transaction in which the consumer expressed an interest, the originator \nmust present and permit the consumer to choose from at least three loans that include: the loan with the lowest \ninterest rate, the loan with the second lowest interest rate, and the loan with the lowest total dollar amount for \norigination points or fees and discount points. The loan originator must have a good faith belief that these are loans \nfor which the consumer likely qualifies. If the originator presents more than three loans to the consumer, the \noriginator must highlight the three loans that satisfy the lowest rate and points criteria in the rule. Proposed \ncomments 36(e)(2)-1 and 36(e)(3)-1 though -4 would provide guidance on the application of the rule.\n\nComment is expressly solicited on whether the proposed rule in \u00a7 226.36(e) and the accompanying commentary \nwould be effective in achieving the stated purpose. Comment is also solicited on the feasibility and practicality of \nsuch a rule, its enforceability, and any unintended adverse effects the rule might have.\n\n36(f)\n\n\n\nThe Board proposes to redesignate existing \u00a7 226.36(d) as \u00a7 226.36(f). Existing \u00a7 226.36(d) provides that \u00a7 226.36 \ndoes not apply to home-equity lines of credit (HELOCs). The redesignation would accommodate proposed new \u00a7 \n226.36(d) and (e), discussed above.\n\nThe Board proposed as part of the 2008 HOEPA proposal to exclude HELOCs from the coverage of \u00a7 226.36 \nbecause of two considerations, which suggested that the protections may be unnecessary for such transactions. \nFirst, the Board understood that most originators of HELOCs hold them in portfolio rather than sell them, which \naligns these originators' interests in loan performance more closely with their borrowers' interests. Second, the \nBoard understood that HELOCs are concentrated in the banking and thrift industries, where the federal banking \nagencies can use their supervisory authority to protect consumers. The Board sought comment on whether these \nconsiderations were valid or whether any or all of the protections in \u00a7 226.36 should apply to HELOCs. Although \nmortgage lenders and other industry representatives commented in support of the proposed exclusion and \nconsumer advocates commented in opposition, neither group provided the Board with substantial evidence as to \nwhether the kinds of problems \u00a7 226.36 addresses exist in the HELOC market.\n\nIn the July 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, the Board limited the scope of \u00a7 226.36 to closed-end mortgages. In the \nabsence of clear evidence of abuse, the Board continued to believe the protections may be unnecessary for the \nreasons discussed above. Nevertheless, the Board remains aware of concerns that creditors may structure \ntransactions as HELOCs solely to evade the protections of \u00a7 226.36. The Board also is aware that many of the \nsame opportunities and incentives that underlie the abuses addressed by \u00a7 226.36 for closed-end mortgages may \nwell exist for HELOCs. Reasons therefore exist for positing that such unfair practices either may or may not occur \nwith HELOCs, but the Board lacks concrete evidence as to which is the case.\n\nThe Board requests comment on whether any or all of the protections in \u00a7 226.36 should apply to HELOCs. \nSpecifically, what evidence exists that shows whether loan originators unfairly manipulate HELOC terms and \nconditions to receive greater compensation, injuring consumers as a result? What evidence is there as to whether \nappraisals obtained for HELOCs have been influenced toward misstating property values? To what extent do \ncreditors contract out HELOC servicing to third parties, thus undermining the Board's premise regarding aligned \ninterests between servicers and consumers? Whether third parties or the original creditors primarily service \nHELOCs, what evidence shows whether they engage in the abusive servicing practices addressed by \u00a7 226.36(c)?\n\nSection 226.37 Special Disclosure Requirements for Closed-End Mortgages\n\nSection 226.17(a), which implements Sections 122(a) and 128(b)(1) of TILA, addresses format and other disclosure \nstandards for all closed-end credit. 15 U.S.C. 1632(a), 1638(b)(1). For closed-end credit, creditors must provide \ndisclosures in writing in a form that the consumer may keep, grouped together and segregated from other \ninformation. In addition, the loan's \"finance charge\" and \"annual percentage rate,\" using those terms, must be more \nconspicuous than other required disclosures.\n\nThe Board proposes special rules in new \u00a7 226.37 to govern the format of required disclosures under TILA for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. These new rules would be in addition to the rules in \u00a7 226.17. \nThe proposed format rules are intended to (1) improve consumers' ability to identify disclosed loan terms more \nreadily; (2) emphasize information that is most important to the consumer in the decision-making process; and (3) \nsimplify the organization and structure of required disclosures to reduce complexity and \"information overload.\" \nProposed \u00a7 226.37 would establish special format rules for disclosures required by proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38 and \n226.20(d), and existing \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c).\n\nThe Board is proposing \u00a7 226.37 and associated commentary to address the duty to provide \"clear and \nconspicuous\" disclosures that are grouped together and segregated from other information, and to require that \ncertain information be highlighted in table form or in a graph. Proposed \u00a7 226.37 would also require creditors to use \nconsistent terminology for all disclosures. The Board is proposing to revise the requirement that certain terms be \nused or disclosed more conspicuously, for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The general \n\n\n\ndisclosure standards under \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) and associated commentary continue to apply transactions secured by \nreal property or a dwelling but, under the proposal creditors would also be required to meet the higher standards \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.37.\n\n37(a) Form of Disclosures\n\n37(a)(1) Clear and Conspicuous\n\nSection 122(a) of TILA and \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) require that all closed-end credit disclosures be made clearly and \nconspicuously. 15 U.S.C. 1632(a). Currently, under comment 17(a)(1)-1, the Board interprets the clear and \nconspicuous standard to mean that disclosures must be in a \"reasonably understandable\" form. This standard does \nnot require any mathematical progression or format, or that disclosures be provided in a particular type size, \nalthough disclosures must be legible whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer. Comment 17(a)(1)-3 \nprovides that the standard does not require disclosures to be located in a particular place.\n\nConsumer testing conducted by the Board showed that information presented without any highlighting or other \nemphasis, and the use of small print led many participants to miss or disregard key information about the loan \ntransaction. As discussed more fully under the following sections, consumer testing indicates that when certain \ninformation is presented and highlighted in a specific way consumers are able to identify and use key terms more \neasily: proposed \u00a7 226.38 for disclosures required on transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, \u00a7 \n226.19(b) for ARM loan program disclosures, \u00a7 226.20(c) for ARM adjustment notices, and \u00a7 226.20(d) for periodic \nstatements on loans that are negatively amortizing. 66 For example, consumer testing of the current TILA model \nform indicated that participants viewed both the interest rate and monthly payment as important. Although \nparticipants generally understood that the interest rate on their loan could change, several arrived at this conclusion \nbecause of the payment schedule disclosure, which showed different monthly payment amounts, not because they \nunderstood the loan had a variable rate feature that would affect their monthly payments. In addition to testing the \ncurrent TILA model form, the Board also tested variations of that form, including a form it developed in 1998 with \nHUD (\"Joint Form\") that was submitted to Congress in the 1998 Joint Report. 67 Participants who reviewed the Joint \nForm also generally understood the loan had an adjustable rate, but less than half understood the rate was fixed \nonly for the first three years and could vary only after that time period. However, when the Board consumer tested \ninformation about interest rates and monthly payments in a tabular form, participants could identify more readily that \nthe loan had an adjustable rate feature, and comprehension of when interest rates would adjust and the impact that \nrate adjustments had on their monthly payments improved.\n\nFor these reasons, the Board proposes to require that creditors make disclosures for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling clearly and conspicuously, by highlighting certain information in accordance with the \nrequirements in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38, 226.19(b), \u00a7 226.20(c), and \u00a7 226.20(d). Proposed comment 37(a)(1)-1 would \nclarify that to meet the clear and conspicuous standard, disclosures must be in a reasonably understandable form \nand readily noticeable to the consumer. Proposed comment 37(a)(1)-2 provides that to meet the readily noticeable \nstandard, the disclosures under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38, 226.19(b), 226.20(c), and 226.20(d) generally must be \nprovided in a minimum 10-point font. The approach of requiring a minimum of 10-point font for certain disclosures is \n\n66 See also Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosures (finding that incorporating white space, using clear headings, and using \ncertain formatting and organization create a \"less intimidating appearance than many consumer financial disclosures, making it \nmore likely that consumers will both want to read the form and be able to use it productively in their decisions.\").\n\n67 See the 1998 Joint Report, App.A-6.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nconsistent with the approach taken by the Board in revising disclosures required under TILA for certain open-end \ncredit. 74 FR 5244; Jan. 29, 2009.\n\nNew comment 37(a)(1)-3 would clarify that disclosures under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38 and 226.19(b) must be provided \non a document separate from other information, although these disclosures, as well as disclosures under proposed \n\u00a7\u00a7 226.20(c) and 226.20(d), may be made on more than one page, on the front or back side of a page, and \ncontinued from one page to the next. Consumer testing suggests that consumers may not read information carefully \nif it is excessive in length, and if unable to identify relevant information quickly are likely to become frustrated and \nnot read the disclosures. The Board believes that allowing creditors to combine disclosures with other information \nmay increase the likelihood that consumers will not read the disclosures.\n\n37(a)(2) Grouped Together and Segregated\n\nSection 128(b)(1) of TILA and \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) currently require that, except for certain information, the disclosures \nrequired for closed-end credit must be grouped together, segregated from everything else, and not contain any \ninformation not directly related to the required disclosures. 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(1). Comment 17(a)(1)-2 states that \ncreditors can satisfy the grouped together and segregation requirement in a variety of ways, including combining \nsegregated disclosures with other information as long as they are set off by a certain format type. Comment \n17(a)(1)-2 further provides that the segregation requirement does not apply to disclosures for variable rate \ntransactions required under current \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c). Comment 17(a)(1)-7 clarifies that balloon-payment \nfinancing with leasing characteristics is subject to the grouped together and segregation requirement.\n\nConsumer testing conducted by the Board indicated that participants generally are overwhelmed by the amount of \ninformation presented for loan transactions, and as a result, do not read their mortgage disclosures carefully. \nConsumer testing showed that emphasizing terms and costs consumers find important, and separating out less \nuseful information, is critical to improving consumers' ability to identify and use key information in their decision-\nmaking process. 68 Consumer testing also demonstrated that grouping related concepts and figures together, and \npresenting them in a particular consumers' ability to identify, comprehend, or use disclosed terms.\n\nFor these reasons, the Board proposes to require that certain disclosures be grouped together and segregated in \nthe manner discussed below, pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Section \n105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions and adjustments to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, \nwhich include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed \nuse of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). Grouping and segregating information which is most useful and relevant \nto the loan transaction would facilitate consumers' ability to evaluate a loan offer.\n\nSegregation of disclosures. Proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2) would implement TILA Section 128(b)(1) of TILA, in part, for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), 1638(b)(1). Proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2) would \nrequire that disclosures for such transactions be grouped together in accordance with the requirements under \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(a) through (j), segregated from other information, and not contain any information not directly \nrelated to the segregated disclosures. Based on consumer testing, the Board also is proposing to require that ARM \nloan program disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b), ARM adjustment notices under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c), and \nperiodic notices for payment option loans that are negatively amortizing under proposed \u00a7 226.20(d), be subject to \n\n68 See also Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosure at 69 (consumer testing results showed that current mortgage disclosure \nforms failed to convey key cost disclosures, but that prototype disclosures, which removed less useful information, significantly \nimproved consumers' recognition of key mortgage costs).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\na grouped-together and segregation requirement. Thus, the reference to \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c) would be \ndeleted from comment 17(a)(1)-2.\n\nProposed comment 37(a)(2)-1 would clarify that to be segregated, disclosures must be set off from other \ninformation. Based on consumer testing, the Board is concerned that allowing creditors to combine disclosures with \nother information, in any format, will diminish the clarity of key disclosures, potentially cause \"information overload,\" \nand increase the likelihood that consumers may not read the disclosures. Proposed comment 37(a)(2)-1 also would \nprovide guidance on how creditors can group together and segregate the disclosures in accordance with proposed \n\u00a7 226.38(a)-(j), such as by using bold print dividing lines.\n\nContent of segregated disclosures; directly related information. Footnotes 37 and 38 currently provide exceptions to \nthe grouped-together and segregation requirement under \u00a7 226.17(a)(1). Footnote 37 allows creditors to include \ninformation not directly related to the required disclosures, such as the consumer's name, address, and account \nnumber. Footnote 38, which implements TILA Section 128(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(1), allows creditors to exclude \ncertain required disclosures from the grouped-together and segregation requirement, such as the creditor's identity \nunder \u00a7 226.18(a), the variable-rate example under \u00a7 226.18(f)(1)(iv), insurance or debt cancellation disclosures \nunder \u00a7 226.18(n), or certain security-interest charges under \u00a7 226.18(o). Comment 17(a)(1)-4 clarifies that \ncreditors have flexibility in grouping the disclosures listed in footnotes 37 and 38 either together with or separately \nfrom segregated disclosures, and comment 17(a)(1)-5 addresses what is considered directly related to the \nsegregated disclosures.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2)(i) and (ii) would provide exceptions to the grouped-together and segregation requirement, \nand implement TILA Section 128(b)(1) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(1). \nProposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2)(i) replicates the content in current footnote 37 and would allow the following disclosures to \nbe made together with the segregated disclosures: the date of the transaction, and the consumer's name, address \nand account number. Proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2)(ii) generally replicates the substance in current footnote 38, except \nthat the Board proposes to remove the reference to the variable-rate example under \u00a7 226.18(f)(iv), which would be \neliminated for mortgage loans as discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b). Under proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2)(ii), \ncreditors also would have flexibility to make the tax deductibility disclosure, as discussed under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(f)(4), together with or separately from other required disclosures.\n\nProposed comment 37(a)(2)-2 clarifies that creditors may add or delete the disclosures listed in proposed \u00a7 \n226.37(a)(2)(i) and (ii) in any combination together with or separate from the segregated disclosures. Proposed \ncomment 37(a)(2)-3 provides guidance on the type of information that would be considered directly related and that \nmay be included with the segregated disclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Information \ndescribed in comments 17(a)(1)-5(i) through (xv) are not included in proposed comment 37(a)(2)-3 because they \nare not applicable to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, or are unnecessary as a result of other \nproposed disclosures: grace periods for late fees; unsecured interest; demand features; instructions on multi-\npurpose forms; minimum finance charge statement; negative amortization; due-on-sale clauses; prepayment of \ninterest statement; the hypothetical example disclosure required by current \u00a7 226.18(f)(1)(iv); the variable rate \ntransaction disclosure required by current \u00a7 226.18(f)(1); assumption; and the late-payment fee disclosure for \nsingle-payment loans.\n\nThe Board also proposes to require that the disclosure of the creditor's identity be grouped together and segregated \nfrom other information, for all closed-end credit. The Board proposes to make this change pursuant to its authority \nunder TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions and \nadjustments to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare \ncredit terms, and avoiding the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). The Board believes that the creditor's \nidentity should be included with the grouped-together and segregated disclosures so that consumers can more \neasily identify the appropriate entity. Thus, current footnote 38 would be revised, and proposed \u00a7 226.37(a)(2) \nwould implement this aspect of the proposal for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n\n\nIn technical revisions, the Board proposes to move the substance of footnotes 37 and 38 to the regulatory text of \u00a7 \n226.17(a)(1). Current comment 17(a)(1)-7 would be revised to address disclosures for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling that have balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics; a cross-reference to \ncomment 17(a)(1)-7 is proposed in new comment 37(a)(2)-4.\n\nThe Board seeks comment on whether it should continue to permit creditors to make the insurance or debt \ncancellation disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.4(d) together with or separately from other required disclosures. \nConsumer testing showed that many participants found these disclosures too long and complex, and as a result \nthey do not read or only skim the disclosures. The Board is concerned that adding the insurance information to the \ninformation about loan terms required by proposed \u00a7 226.38 will result in \"information overload.\"\n\nMulti-purpose forms. Comment 17(a)(1)-6 currently permits creditors to design multi-purpose forms for TILA-\nrequired closed-end credit disclosures as long as the clear and conspicuous requirement is met. The Board \nproposes to require that disclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling be made only as \napplicable, as discussed more fully under proposed \u00a7 226.38. As noted, consumer testing indicates that consumers \nmay not read information if it is excessive in length, and if unable to identify relevant information quickly are likely to \nbecome frustrated and not read the disclosures. The Board believes that allowing creditors to combine disclosures \nwith other information that is not applicable to the transaction may contribute to \"information overload,\" and increase \nthe likelihood that consumers will not read the disclosures.\n\nFor these reasons, under the proposal creditors would not be permitted to use forms for more than one type of \nmortgage transaction (i.e., multi-purpose forms). The Board believes technology and form design software will allow \ncreditors to prepare transaction-specific, customized disclosure forms at minimal cost. The Board seeks comment, \nhowever, on whether creditors already provide consumers with customized disclosures forms for mortgage loans in \nthe regular course of business, or the extent to which creditors rely on multi-purpose forms. The Board seeks \ncomment on potential operational changes, difficulties, or costs that would be incurred to implement the \nrequirement to have transaction-specific disclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n37(b) Separate Disclosures\n\nExisting \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) requires certain disclosures to be provided separately from the segregated information, such \nas the itemization of amount financed required by \u00a7 226.18(c)(1) and TILA Section 128(a)(2)(A). 15 U.S.C. \n1638(a)(2)(A). The Board is proposing to expand the list of disclosures that must be provided separately from the \nsegregated information, based on consumer testing.\n\nConsumer testing showed that certain disclosures, such as disclosures about assumption or property insurance, \nwere confusing to participants, or were generally not as useful in the participants' decision-making process as other \ninformation. For example, with respect to assumption, few participants understood the current assumption policy \nmodel clause in Model Clause H-6 in Appendix H to Regulation Z; almost no one stated that the assumption was \nimportant information when applying for and obtaining a loan. With respect to property insurance, most participants \nunderstood that the borrower can obtain property insurance from anyone that is acceptable to the lender, but \nparticipants stated they were already aware of this fact and therefore this information was not useful. Regarding \nrebates, consumers understood that early payoff of the loan could result in a refund of interest and fees, and \ngenerally expressed interest in knowing this information. However, most also indicated that information about \nrebates would not have an impact on whether they accepted a loan and therefore, it was not as important or useful \nto the decision-making process as other information, such as interest rate or closing costs.\n\nWith respect to the contract reference, almost all participants understood already that they could read their contract \nto learn what could happen if they stopped making payments, defaulted, paid off or refinanced their loan early. In \naddition, other proposed disclosures, such as the prepayment penalty under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) or demand \nfeature under proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iv), would make the contract reference disclosure less important because \nsuch information would already be disclosed directly on the disclosure statement itself. Moreover, because creditors \n\n\n\nmust provide disclosures within three business days after application for transactions secured by real property or a \nconsumer's dwelling, consumers will not have a contract to reference at this point in time.\n\nFor these reasons, the Board proposes to require that certain information be disclosed separately from the grouped \ntogether and segregation information, to improve consumers' ability to focus on the terms that are most important \nfor shopping and decision-making. 69 New \u00a7 226.37(b) would require that creditors provide the following disclosures \nseparately from other information for transactions secured by real-property or a dwelling: Itemization of amount \nfinanced under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1); rebates under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(2); late payment under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(j)(3); property insurance under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(4); contract reference under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(5); \nand assumption under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(6).\n\nThe Board proposes this approach pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Section \n105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions and adjustments to TILA for any class of transactions to effectuate \nthe statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers \navoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). In this case, the Board believes an exception from \nTILA's grouped together and segregation requirement is necessary to effectuate the Act's purposes for transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling. As noted above, many consumers may not read information if it is excessive \nin length, and if unable to identify relevant information quickly are likely to become frustrated and not read the \ndisclosures. The Board is concerned that allowing creditors to combine the information in proposed \u00a7 226.38(j) with \nother required information could contribute to \"information overload,\" distract from other important disclosures, such \nas the APR or monthly payments, and may increase the likelihood that consumers will not read the disclosures. \nThus, the Board believes that requiring these disclosures to be separate from the other required disclosures will \nserve TILA's purpose to avoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a).\n\n37(c) Terminology\n\n37(c)(1) Consistent Terminology\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement that TILA disclosures for closed-end credit use consistent terminology. Consumer \ntesting showed that some participants were confused when different terms are used for the same information. For \nexample, when the terms loan amount, principal, and loan balance were used, some participants attributed different \nmeaning to each term used. Based on these findings, the Board proposes \u00a7 226.37(c)(1) to require the use of \nconsistent terminology for the disclosures under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38, 226.19(b), 226.20(c) and 226.20(d). The \nBoard believes that using consistent terminology will enhance a consumers' ability to identify, review, and \ncomprehend disclosed terms across all disclosures and therefore, avoid the uninformed use of credit. Proposed \ncomment 37(c)(1)-1 clarifies that terms do not need to be identical, unless otherwise specified, but must be close \nenough in meaning to enable the consumer to relate the disclosures to one another. Proposed comment 37(c)(1)-2 \nprovides guidance on combining terms for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling when more than one \nnumerical disclosure would be the same, and provides an example relating to the total payments and amount \nfinanced disclosures required under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) and 226.38(e)(5)(iii), respectively.\n\n37(c)(2) Terms Required To Be More Conspicuous\n\n69 See also Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosures at 37-38, 59-60 (finding that streamlining disclosures improved \nconsumer ability to identify and understand key terms of the loan transaction disclosed).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCurrently TILA Section 122(a) and \u00a7 226.17(a)(2) require creditors to disclose the terms \"finance charge\" and \n\"annual percentage rate,\" together with a corresponding dollar amount and percentage rate, more conspicuously \nthan any other disclosure, except the creditor's identity under \u00a7 226.18(a). 15 U.S.C. 1632(a). Under TILA Section \n103(u), the finance charge and the annual percentage rate are material disclosures; failure to disclose either term \nextends the right of rescission under TILA Section 125, and can result in actual and statutory damages under TILA \nSection 130(a). 15 U.S.C. 1602(u); 15 U.S.C. 1635, 1640(a).\n\nFinance charge: interest and settlement charges. Section 226.18(d), which implements TILA Sections 128(a)(3) and \n(a)(8), requires creditors to disclose the \"finance charge,\" using that term, and a brief description such as \"the dollar \namount the credit will cost you\" for closed-end credit. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(3), (a)(8). Consumer testing showed that \nparticipants could not correctly explain what the finance charge represented. Many consumers recognized that the \nfinance charge included all of the interest they would pay over the loan's term, but did not know that it also included \nfees. Most participants did not find the finance charge to be useful in evaluating a loan offer. However, some \nparticipants expressed a general interest in knowing the information.\n\nBased on these results, the Board tested a form with the finance charge disclosed as \"interest and settlement \ncharges,\" to more closely represent the components of the finance charge. Participants generally understood the \nterm, but still stated that they did not find the term very useful, particularly when compared to other information such \nas the interest rate or monthly payments. Consumer testing suggests that highlighting terms that are not useful in \nthe decision-making process may generally diminish consumers' ability to understand other key terms.\n\nFor these reasons, and as discussed more fully in the discussion of proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii), the Board proposes \nto exercise its authority under TILA Section 105(a) to make certain exceptions to the disclosure of the finance \ncharge under TILA Section 128(a)(3) and TILA Section 122(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a); 1632(a); 1638(a)(3). First, \ncreditors would be required to disclose the finance charge as \"interest and settlement charges,\" not as the \"finance \ncharge\" as required by TILA Section 128(a)(3). 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(3). Second, the disclosure of interest and \nsettlement charges would not have to be more conspicuous than other terms, as required by TILA Section 122(a). \n15 U.S.C. 1632(a).\n\nThe exception to TILA's requirements that the finance charge be disclosed as the \"finance charge\" and that it be \nmore conspicuous than other information is proposed pursuant to TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). The \nBoard has authority under TILA Section 105(a) to adopt \"such adjustments and exceptions for any class of \ntransactions as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this title, to \nprevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.\" 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The \nclass of transactions that would be affected is closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The \nBoard believes an exception from TILA's requirements is necessary and proper to effectuate TILA's purposes to \nassure meaningful disclosure and informed credit use. Consumer testing showed that disclosing the finance charge \nas \"interest and settlement charges\" improved participants' understanding of the information, even though the figure \nmay not include all interest and settlement charges applicable to the transaction. (See discussion under proposed \u00a7 \n226.4 regarding content and calculation of the interest and settlement charges.) Moreover, consumer testing \nshowed that participants did not find the interest and settlement charges as useful, when choosing or evaluating a \nloan product, as other information, such as whether the loan has an adjustable rate or the monthly payment \namount.\n\nIn addition, and for the reasons discussed more fully under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii) regarding interest and \nsettlement charges, the proposal would group the interest and settlement charges disclosure with other disclosures \nrelating to the total cost of the loan offered, such as the total of payments and the amount financed. Consumer \ntesting conducted by the Board, as well as basic document design principles, shows that grouping related concepts \nand figures makes it easier for consumers to identify, comprehend, or use disclosed terms.\n\nAnnual percentage rate. TILA Section 122(a) and \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) require that the term \"annual percentage rate,\" \nwhen disclosed with the corresponding percentage rate, be disclosed more conspicuously than any other required \ndisclosure. 15 U.S.C. 1632(a). The Board is proposing to revise the description of the APR and require that \n\n\n\ncreditors provide context for the APR by disclosing it on a scaled graph with explanatory text, as discussed more \nfully under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(b). In addition, the Board is proposing \u00a7 226.37(c)(2) to implement TILA Section \n122(a) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. 15 U.S.C. 1632(a). Section 226.37(c)(2) would \nrequire that creditors disclose the APR in a 16-point font, in a prominent location, and in close proximity to the \nscaled graph and explanations proposed under \u00a7 226.38(b)(2) through (4).\n\nAs discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.38(b), the APR is one of the most important terms disclosed about the loan; it \nis the only single, unified number available to help consumers understand the overall cost of a loan. To this end, the \nBoard believes it is essential that consumers be able to identify the APR easily. Consumer testing and basic \ndocument design principles show that participants generally pay greater attention to figures, such as numbers, \npercentages and dollar signs, than to terminology that may accompany, describe or label any disclosed figure. \nHowever, the TILA disclosure contains many numerical figures that consumers must identify and review. Given that \nthe Board is proposing to require a minimum 10-point font for disclosure of other terms on the TILA (see discussion \nunder proposed comment 37(a)(1)-2), and based on document design principles, the Board consumer tested \ndisclosing the APR figure in a larger font and in bold text to make it more readily noticeable as compared to other \ndisclosed terms. When tested in this manner, participants were able to easily identify the APR. Based on consumer \ntesting, the Board believes that a 16-point font requirement for the APR is sufficient to highlight the APR. The Board \nalso notes that the approach of requiring at least a 16-point font for the APR disclosure is consistent with the \napproach taken by the Board in revising the purchase APR disclosure required under TILA for open-end credit. 74 \nFR 5244; Jan. 29, 2009.\n\nProposed comment 37(c)-3(i) through (iii) would provide further guidance on the more conspicuous requirement \nand would clarify that the APR must be more conspicuous only in relation to other required disclosures under \nproposed \u00a7 226.38, and only as required under proposed \u00a7 226.37(c)(2) and \u00a7 226.38(b). Proposed comment \n37(c)-4 would provide guidance on how creditors can comply with the more conspicuous requirement for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\nThe Board seeks comment on whether the APR should be made more or less prominent using a larger or smaller \nfont-size, and whether different graphs or visuals could be used to provide better context for the APR. The Board \nalso seeks comment on the relative advantages and disadvantages of a graphic-based versus text-based approach \nto disclosing the APR, and the potential operational changes, difficulties, or costs that would be incurred to \nimplement the graphic-based APR disclosure requirement for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n37(d) Specific Formats\n\nCurrently, \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) does not impose special format design or location requirements on disclosures for closed-\nend credit. However, as discussed more fully under proposed \u00a7 226.38, consumer testing showed that the current \nTILA form did not present key loan information in a manner that was noticeable and easy for consumers to \nunderstand. For example, the payment schedule required under current \u00a7 226.18(g) did not effectively demonstrate \nto participants the relationship between monthly payments and an adjustable interest rate feature. Consumer \ntesting also showed that the current TILA form highlighted terms that confused many participants. For example, \nmost participants incorrectly assumed the amount financed was the same as the loan amount, a term not required \non the current TILA form. In other instances, the current TILA form emphasized information that participants \ngenerally understood, but did not find useful or important, such as the total of payments. Many participants also \nnoted that the current TILA form failed to include information they would find useful when shopping or evaluating a \nloan offer, such as the contract interest rate and settlement charges.\n\nAs discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.19, consumer testing of the current ARM loan program disclosure and the \nCHARM booklet also revealed ineffective presentation of information relating to adjustable rate loan programs. \nMany participants found the narrative format and terminology used in the current ARM loan program disclosure \ncomplicated, dense, and difficult to read and understand. With respect to the CHARM booklet, many participants \ngenerally indicated that the information it contained was informative and educational, but they would be unlikely to \nread it because it was too long.\n\n\n\nIn addition, as noted previously, consumer testing suggests that consumers may not read information carefully if it \nis excessive in length, and if unable to identify relevant information quickly are likely to become frustrated and not \nread the disclosures. As discussed more fully under proposed \u00a7 226.37(a) through (c), this suggests highlighting \nand structuring disclosures in a particular manner to improve clarity, identification and comprehension of disclosed \nterms.\n\nTo address the problems with the current TILA form and ARM loan program disclosures, the Board used various \nformats to present key loan information, such as tabular forms and question and answer format. Consumer testing \nsuggests that using tabular forms improved participants' ability to readily identify and understand key information, \nas discussed under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.38(c). For example, current ARM loan program disclosures \nprovide information in narrative form, which participants found difficult to read and understand. However, consumer \ntesting showed that when information about interest rate, monthly payment and loan features was presented in \ntabular format, participants found the information easier to locate and their comprehension of the disclosed terms \nimproved. The benefits of disclosing important information in a tabular format are consistent with the results of \nconsumer testing conducted by the Board in revising credit card disclosures. 74 FR 5244; Jan. 29, 2009. Consumer \ntesting also showed that using question and answer format improved participants' ability to recognize and \nunderstand potentially risky or costly features of a loan, as discussed under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19 and 226.38(d). \nConsumer testing and basic document design principles suggest that keeping language and design elements \nconsistent between forms improves consumers' ability to identify and track changes in the information being \ndisclosed. As a result, the Board also integrated the question and answer format used on the revised TILA model \nform into ARM loan program disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b).\n\nTo present key loan terms more effectively, the Board also used specific location and structure requirements. \nConsumer testing suggests that the location and order in which information is presented impacts consumers' ability \nto find and comprehend the information disclosed. For example, as discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a), \ndisclosing key information, such as the loan term, amount, type, and settlement charges, before other required \ndisclosures and in a tabular format improved participants' ability to quickly and accurately identify key loan terms. In \nanother example, participants' ability to identify the frequency of rate adjustments after an introductory period \nexpired also improved when this information was included both in the loan summary section at the top of the \nrevised TILA model form, and then again below in the interest rate and payment summary section.\n\nBased on consumer testing results, basic document design principles, and for the reasons discussed more fully \nunder each of the following subsections, the Board is proposing to establish special format rules for: disclosures \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.38 for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling; ARM loan program disclosures \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.19(b) for adjustable rate transactions; ARM adjustment notices under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c); \nand periodic statements required for payment option loans that are negatively amortizing under proposed \u00a7 \n226.20(d). The special rules regarding format, structure and location of disclosures are noted in proposed \u00a7 \n226.37(d)(1) through (10). Proposed comments 37(d)-1 and -2 would provide guidance to creditors on how to \ncomply with the special format rules noted in proposed \u00a7 226.37(d)(1) through (10) regarding prominence and close \nproximity of disclosed terms.\n\n37(e) Electronic Disclosures\n\nCurrently, under \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) creditors are permitted to provide in electronic form any TILA disclosure for closed-\nend credit that is required to be provided or made available to consumers in writing if the consumer affirmatively \nconsents to receipt of electronic disclosures in a prescribed manner. Electronic Signatures in Global and National \nCommerce Act (the E-Sign Act), 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq. The Board proposes \u00a7 226.37(e) to allow creditors to \nprovide required disclosures for transactions covered by proposed \u00a7 226.38 in electronic form in accordance with \nthe requirements under \u00a7 226.17(a)(1).\n\nSection 226.38 Content of Disclosures for Credit Secured by Real Property or a Dwelling\n\n\n\n38(a) Loan Summary\n\nTo shop for and understand the cost of credit, consumers must be able to identify and understand the key credit \nterms offered to them. As discussed below, the Board's consumer testing suggested that loan amount, loan term \nand loan type are key terms that consumers are familiar with and expect to see on closed-end mortgage \ndisclosures, together with settlement charges and whether a prepayment penalty would apply to their loan.\n\nThe Board's Proposal\n\nThe Board proposes to require creditors to provide the following key loan features in a loan summary section: loan \namount, loan term, loan type, the total settlement charges, whether a prepayment penalty applies and, the \nmaximum amount of the penalty. The purpose of the proposed disclosures is to improve their effectiveness and \nconsumer comprehension. A concise loan summary would help consumers compare loan offers; a summary may \nalso help consumers determine whether they can afford the loan they are offered, and whether the disclosure \npresents the same loan terms they discussed with their mortgage broker or lender.\n\nThe Board conducted consumer testing of loan summary disclosures. Participants were able to identify the exact \nloan amount, what type of a loan they were being offered, how long they would have to pay off their loan, how \nmuch they would have to pay in settlement charges, and whether a prepayment penalty would apply. A discussion \nof the items that would be included in the loan summary follows.\n\n38(a)(1) Loan Amount\n\nCurrently creditors are not required to disclose the loan amount for closed-end mortgages, except for loans subject \nto HOEPA. Under \u00a7 226.32(c)(5), creditors are required to disclose the total amount borrowed. The Board is \nproposing to require a similar disclosure of the loan amount for all transactions secured by a real property or a \ndwelling. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(1) would require creditors to disclose \"loan amount,\" which would be defined as the \nprincipal amount the consumer will borrow reflected in the note or loan contract. The loan amount is a core loan \nterm that the consumer should be able to verify readily on the disclosure. Disclosing the loan amount may also alert \nthe consumer to fees that are financed in addition to the principal balance.\n\n38(a)(2) Loan Term\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires creditors to disclose the number of payments but not the term of the loan. The \nBoard believes that the loan term is an important fact about the loan that consumers should know when evaluating \na loan offer. Consumer testing of current model forms conducted by the Board indicated that some consumers are \nnot able to readily identify the loan term from the number of payments disclosed in the current disclosures. Although \nsome participants could determine the loan term by dividing by 12 the number of months shown in the payment \nschedule disclosed under \u00a7 226.18(g), other participants could not readily figure the term of the loan offered, \nparticularly for loans that have multiple payment levels, such as discounted adjustable-rate mortgages. For these \nreasons, the Board is proposing to require disclosure of the loan term in the summary section for loans covered by \n\u00a7 226.38, and to define \"loan term\" for these purposes as the time to repay the obligation in full. For instance, \ninstead of disclosing the number of months for each payment amount for variable interest rate loans and requiring \nthe consumer to add up those months to determine the loan term, the proposed disclosure would state \"Loan term: \n30 years.\" Likewise, for a 10-year loan with a balloon payment due in year 10 and an amortization schedule of 30 \nyears, the proposed disclosure would state \"Loan term: 10 years.\"\n\n38(a)(3) Loan Type and Features\n\nRegulation Z does not require the creditor to disclose the type of the loan, except in the case of loans with variable \ninterest rates. Current \u00a7 226.18(f) requires a disclosure of a variable rate if the annual percentage rate may \n\n\n\nincrease after consummation. The Board's consumer testing indicates that the current variable rate disclosures may \nnot clearly convey whether the loan has a fixed or a variable interest rate. The Board believes that a specific \ndisclosure of a loan type offered will assist consumers in better understanding whether a loan features a rate that \nmay increase after consummation, so that the consumer may evaluate whether they want a loan in which the rate \nand payments can increase.\n\nThe Board is proposing to require a disclosure of the loan type in the loan summary section for loans covered by \u00a7 \n226.38. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i) would require that a loan be classified as one of three types: an \"adjustable-rate \nmortgage (ARM),\" a \"step-rate mortgage,\" or a \"fixed-rate mortgage\" using those terms. The categories proposed in \n\u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i) apply only to disclosures requires for closed-end transaction secured by real property or a \ndwelling, and are different from the categories in \u00a7 226.18(f) and commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(1). Proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(a)(3)(ii) would require an additional disclosure if the loan has one or more of the following three features: \n\"negative amortization,\" \"interest-only payments,\" or \"step-payments,\" using those terms. The related commentary \nwould provide examples for each loan type and feature.\n\n38(a)(3)(i) Loan Type\n\nAs discussed above, consumer testing indicated that the current variable rate disclosure is not sufficiently clear for \nmany consumers. When presented with a current closed-end model form for an adjustable-rate mortgage, over half \nof the participants understood that the interest rate would change. However, several participants inferred this from \nthe different monthly payments in the payment schedule, not because the check box on the form indicated that the \nloan had a \"variable rate.\" A few participants indicated that they did not know whether the rate would change. Some \nparticipants commented that although the current model form used the term \"variable rate,\" they were more familiar \nwith the term \"adjustable rate.\" As a result, the Board tested revised disclosures using the term \"adjustable rate \nmortgage\" in the loan summary section. All participants who were shown a revised disclosure for a variable rate \ntransaction using the term \"adjustable-rate mortgage\" understood that the interest rate and payments could change \nduring the loan's term.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i) would define an adjustable-rate mortgage as a transaction in which the annual \npercentage rate may increase after consummation; a step-rate mortgage as a transaction in which the interest rate \nwill change after consummation as specified in the legal obligation between the parties; and a fixed-rate mortgage \nas a transaction that is neither an adjustable-rate mortgage nor a step-rate mortgage. Proposed comment \n38(a)(3)(i)(A)-2 would offer examples of adjustable-rate mortgages and clarify that some variable-rate transactions \ndescribed in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-4, such as certain renewable balloon-payment, preferred-rate and price-level-\nadjusted loans, would be considered fixed-rate mortgages for the purposes of the \"loan type\" disclosure in the loan \nsummary required by \u00a7 226.38(a). This follows the current approach in comment 17(c)(1)-11 which provide that \ndisclosures for certain variable-rate transactions should be based on the interest rate that applies at consummation.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i)(B) would require the creditor to disclose a loan as a \"step-rate mortgage\" if the interest \nrate will change after consummation, provided all such interest rates are specified in the legal obligation between \nthe parties. Under existing guidance, such a loan would not be considered a variable rate loan. The Board believes \nthat for the purposes of the loan summary, which is to alert the consumer to the possibility that their interest rate \nand payment could increase after consummation, step-rate loans should not be identified as fixed or variable rate \nloans, even though they share certain features with both loan types. Proposed comment 38(a)(3)(i)(B)-2 would \nclarify that certain preferred-rate loans would not be considered step-rate mortgages for the purposes of the \"loan \ntype\" disclosures. Proposed comment 38(a)(3)(i)(C)-1 would offer examples of fixed-rate mortgages and explain \nwhich variable-rate transactions described in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)-4 would be considered fixed-rate mortgages for \nthe purposes of the \"loan type\" disclosure.\n\n38(a)(3)(ii) Loan Features\n\n\n\nThe general classification of loans as fixed rate, adjustable rate and step rate would enable consumers to \nunderstand what loan type they are being offered and to shop for loan products according to consumers' needs and \npreferences. However, these broad categories of loan types are not sufficient to warn consumers about the \npotential risks that a specific loan may carry. As discussed previously, nontraditional mortgage products with \nnegatively amortizing or interest-only payments grew in popularity in recent years, subjecting consumers to the risk \nof payment shock. Disclosures should clearly alert consumers to these features before the consumer becomes \nobligated on the loan. To alert consumers to potentially risky loan features, the Board is proposing to require an \nadditional disclosure for each loan type in the loan summary if the loan has step-payments, payment option or \nnegative amortization features, or interest-only payments.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(ii) would require creditors to disclose whether a loan would have one or more of the \nfollowing features: Step-payments if the legal obligation permits the periodic monthly payment to increase by a set \namount for a specified amount of time; a payment option feature if the legal obligation permits the consumer to \nmake payments that result in negative amortization and other types of payments; a negative amortization feature if \nthe legal obligation requires the consumer to make payments that result in negative amortization--that is, the legal \nobligation does not permit the consumer to make payments that would cover all interest accrued or all interest \naccrued and principal; or an interest-only feature if the legal obligation permits or requires the consumer to make \none or more regular periodic payments of interest accrued and no principal, and the legal obligation does not \nrequire or permit any payments that would result in negative amortization. Proposed comment 38(a)(3)(ii)(A)-1 \nwould offer an example of a step-payment feature. For example, if the consumer is offered a fixed-rate mortgage \nwith 24 monthly payments at $ 1,000 that will later increase to $ 1,200 and remain at that level for a specified period \nof time, and the loan amortizes fully over the loan term, the creditor would disclose \"Fixed-Rate Mortgage, step-\npayments\" for the loan type in the loan summary. Proposed comment 38(a)(3)(ii)(B) and (C)-1 would clarify that a \ncreditor should disclose the loan feature as either \"payment option\" or \"negative amortization\" but not both, whereas \na loan may have both a \"step-payment\" feature and either a \"payment option\" or a \"negative amortization\" feature. \nMoreover, for a loan to have a \"payment option\" feature, all periodic payment choices must be specified in the legal \nobligation and must include a choice to make payments that may result in negative amortization. Proposed \ncomment 38(a)(3)(ii)(D)-1 would provide that a creditor should not disclose both an \"interest-only\" feature and a \n\"payment option\" feature or \"negative amortization\" feature in a single transaction, whereas a loan may have both \nan \"interest-only\" feature and a \"step-payment\" feature.\n\n38(a)(4) Total Settlement Charges\n\nCurrently, TILA and Regulation Z disclose settlement charges through the finance charge. TILA Section 128(a)(3) \nand \u00a7 226.18(d) require the creditor to disclose the finance charge. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(3). TILA Section 106(a) \ndefines the \"finance charge\" as the \"sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the \ncredit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the credit or as an incident to the extension of credit.\" 15 \nU.S.C. 1605(a). Section 226.4(a) further defines the \"finance charge\" as \"the cost of consumer credit as a dollar \namount.\" The finance charge includes any interest due under the loan terms as well as other charges incurred in \nconnection with the credit transaction. See \u00a7 226.4(a) and (b).\n\nConsumer testing indicated that participants did not understand the term \"finance charge.\" Most participants \nbelieved the term referred only to the total amount of interest they would pay if they kept the loan to maturity, but did \nnot always realize that it also includes the fees and costs incurred as part of the credit transaction. Most participants \ndid not find the finance charge useful in evaluating a loan offer.\n\nThe disclosure of settlement charges is governed by RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2601-2617, and implemented by HUD \nunder Regulation X, 24 CFR part 3500. Under RESPA and Regulation X, creditors must provide a GFE of \nsettlement costs within three business days of application for a mortgage, which is the same time creditors must \nprovide the early TILA disclosure. RESPA and Regulation X also require a statement of the final settlement costs at \nloan closing (\"HUD--1 or HUD--1A settlement statement\"). Under the new final rule for Regulation X, effective \n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2010, the GFE is subject to certain accuracy requirements, absent changed circumstances. RESPA and \nRegulation X do not, however, provide any remedies for a violation of the accuracy requirements.\n\nConsumer testing consistently demonstrated that participants wanted to see settlement charges on the revised \nTILA disclosure. Participants stated that including such a disclosure would help them confirm information that the \nloan originator told them about the cost of the loan during the mortgage application process. During consumer \ntesting, participants indicated that they were often surprised at the closing table by substantial increases in the \nsettlement charges. Despite these changes, consumers reported that they proceeded with closing because they \nlacked alternatives (especially in the case of a home purchase loan), or were told that they could easily refinance \nwith better terms in the near future. Participants indicated that they would like an estimate of their settlement \ncharges as early as possible in the loan process, and that it would be helpful to have the settlement charges \ndisplayed in the context of the other loan terms, rather than on a separate GFE or HUD--1 or HUD--1A settlement \nstatement.\n\nFor these reasons, the Board proposes \u00a7 226.38(a)(4) to require creditors to disclose the \"total settlement charges,\" \nusing that term, as those charges are disclosed under Regulation X, 12 CFR part 3500. The proposed rule would \nfurther require, as applicable, a statement of the amount of the charges already included in the loan amount. \nFinally, the proposed rule would require disclosure of a statement, as applicable, that the total amount does not \ninclude a down payment, along with a reference to the GFE or HUD--1 for more details.\n\nProposed comment 38(a)(4)-1 would clarify that on the early TILA disclosure required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i), the \ncreditor must disclose the amount of the \"Total Estimated Settlement Charges\" as disclosed on the GFE under \nRegulation X, 12 CFR part 3500, Appendix C. For the final TILA disclosure required by proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii), \nthe creditor would be required to disclose the sum of the final settlement charges. The creditor would be permitted \nto use the sum of the \"Charges That Cannot Increase,\" \"Charges That In Total Cannot Increase By More Than \n10%,\" and \"Charges That Can Change\" as would be disclosed in the column entitled \"HUD--1\" on page three of the \nHUD--1 or on page two of the HUD--1A settlement statement under Regulation X, 12 CFR part 3500, Appendix A. \nAlternatively, the creditor would be permitted to provide the consumer with the final HUD--1 or HUD--1A settlement \nstatement. For transactions in which a GFE, HUD--1 or HUD--1A are not required, the proposed comment would \nclarify that the creditor may look to such documents for guidance on how to comply with the requirements of this \nsection.\n\nThe Board recognizes that creditors are not currently required to provide the final settlement charges before \nconsummation. Regulation X, 24 CFR 3500.10(b), permits the settlement agent to provide the completed HUD--1 or \nHUD--1A at settlement. However, proposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) would require the creditor to provide the TILA \ndisclosure required by proposed \u00a7 226.38, including the total settlement charges disclosed under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(a)(4), so that the consumer receives it at least three business days before consummation. In addition, under \nproposed \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii)--Alternative 1, if anything changes during the three-business-day waiting period, \nincluding total settlement charges, the creditor would be required to supply another final TILA disclosure and three-\nbusiness-day waiting period before consummation could occur. Consumers could waive the three-day waiting \nperiods for bona fide personal financial emergencies.\n\nThe Board recognizes that proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii), 226.19(a)(2)(iii)--Alternative 1, and 226.38(a)(4) would \nrequire the creditor to disclose final settlement charge information several days in advance of consummation. These \nrequirements would impose a cost on creditors, which may be passed on to consumers. Operational procedures \nand systems would need to be changed significantly to determine several days before closing the precise total \namount of settlement charges that the consumer would pay at settlement. The Board believes, however, that the \ncost would be outweighed by the benefit to consumers of knowing their final total settlement charges three business \ndays before consummation. This proposal would enable consumers to review and verify cost information in \nadvance of consummation, and contact the creditor with questions or take other action, as appropriate.\n\n38(a)(5) Prepayment Penalty\n\n\n\nCurrent Disclosure Requirements\n\nUnder TILA Section 128(a)(11) and existing \u00a7 226.18(k)(1), if an obligation includes a finance charge computed by \napplying a rate to the unpaid principal balance (a \"simple-interest obligation\"), creditors must disclose whether or \nnot a penalty may be imposed if the consumer prepays the obligation in full. Comment 18(k)(1)-1 states that the \nterm \"penalty\" refers only to charges that are assessed because of the prepayment in full of a simple-interest \nobligation, in addition to other amounts.\n\nThe existing model form in Appendix H--2 contains checkboxes for creditors to indicate whether a consumer \"may\" \nor \"will not\" have to pay a penalty if the consumer prepays the obligation in full. The Board adopted these checkbox \noptions in 1980, in response to concerns that a statement that a prepayment penalty \"will be imposed\" would be \nmisleading. The Board noted that many credit contracts allow a penalty to be imposed only if the loan is paid off \nwithin a certain time period after consummation or under other specific circumstances. See 45 FR 80648, 80682; \nDec. 5, 1980.\n\nDiscussion\n\nConsumer testing of the current disclosure showed that participants had difficulty identifying whether a loan would \nhave a prepayment penalty and in what circumstances it would apply. For example, in the Board's consumer \ntesting, participants did not understand that refinancing a loan or paying off the loan with proceeds from the sale of \nthe home securing the loan could trigger a prepayment penalty. Similarly, consumer testing conducted by FTC staff \nfound that two-thirds of participants who looked at a sample of the existing TILA disclosure showing a loan with a \ntwo-year prepayment penalty did not understand that a prepayment penalty would be charged if the consumer \nrefinanced the loan two years after origination. 70 Some participants thought that a prepayment penalty could be \ncharged only if they paid off their entire loan from their own funds, such as with money obtained through a sudden \nfinancial windfall. 71\n\nThe Board developed and tested a revised prepayment penalty disclosure. Participants in the Board's consumer \ntesting generally understood that if they prepaid the loan within the time specified in the disclosure, a penalty could \nbe imposed. Participants also understood that the penalty could be imposed if they refinanced or sold the home \nduring the time the penalty was in effect.\n\nThe Board's Proposal\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5), if the legal obligation permits a creditor to impose a prepayment penalty the \ncreditor must disclose in the \"Loan Summary\" section the period during which the penalty provision applies, the \nmaximum possible penalty, and the circumstances in which the creditor may impose the penalty. If the legal \nobligation does not allow the creditor to impose a prepayment penalty, the creditor would make no disclosure \nregarding prepayment penalties in the \"Loan Summary\" section. (However, proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(iii) requires the \ncreditor to disclose whether or not the legal obligation permits the creditor to charge a prepayment penalty in the \n\"Key Questions about Risk\" section.)\n\n70 Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosures at 78.\n\n71 Id.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMaximum penalty amount. The Board is proposing to require creditors to disclose the maximum penalty possible \nunder the legal obligation. Prepayment penalties may be substantial. The existence of a prepayment penalty may \nmake it difficult to refinance a loan or sell a home. This may be particularly difficult for consumers who have \nadjustable rate loans or other loans that pose the risk of payment shock, as these consumers may believe that they \ncan refinance or sell the home to avoid the increased payments. Thus, it is important for consumers to know the \nmaximum penalty amount before they are obligated on a loan.\n\nUnder proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) and (d)(1)(iii), creditors could not disclose the method or formula they use to \ndetermine the penalty with the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38. Although some consumers might benefit from \nknowing how a prepayment penalty will be determined, the Board is concerned that consumers may be overloaded \nwith information if the calculation method is included with the segregated information. Many consumers would not \nread the prepayment penalty disclosure at all if it contains mathematical procedures and terms. Creditors may, of \ncourse, disclose how a prepayment penalty will be determined, as long as the disclosure is not disclosed together \nwith the segregated disclosures.\n\nCreditors also could not disclose a range of possible prepayment penalties or give examples of penalty amounts \nassuming the consumer prepaid at a hypothetical point in time under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) or (d)(1)(iii). The \nBoard believes that it is important that prepayment penalty disclosures simply and clearly convey to consumers the \npotential magnitude of the prepayment penalty. Disclosures based on assumptions or averages could undermine \nthe impact of the maximum penalty disclosure.\n\nAdditional penalty disclosures. Consumer testing indicated that some consumers do not understand that paying off \nthe loan with the proceeds of a refinance loan or a home sale can trigger a prepayment penalty provision, as \ndiscussed above. Therefore, the proposed rule would require creditors to disclose the conditions upon which and \nthe period during which they may impose a prepayment penalty.\n\nIt is important for a consumer to know what actions will trigger a prepayment penalty provision before obtaining a \nloan with such a provision. Consumers likely will not receive the loan agreement containing the prepayment penalty \nprovision until consummation and may have little opportunity to review the agreement before becoming obligated. \nMoreover, a prepayment penalty is but one of many loan terms for consumers to consider at closing. The Board \nbelieves that including key information about a prepayment penalty provision in transaction-specific disclosures \nwould help consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit.\n\nCoverage. Comment 226.18(k)(1)-1 clarifies that \u00a7 226.18(k)(1) applies to transactions in which interest calculations \ntake into account all scheduled reductions in principal, whether interest calculations are made daily or at some other \ninterval. Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-1 is consistent with comment 18(k)(1)-1. Proposed \u00a7 38(j)(2) reflects existing \n\u00a7 226.18(k)(2) on rebate disclosures, as discussed below. Existing comment 18(k)-2 discusses cases where a \nsingle transaction involves both a rebate and a penalty. Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-8 reflects this existing \ncommentary.\n\nDefinition of prepayment penalty. Comment 18(k)(1)-1 states that under \u00a7 226.18(k)(1) the term \"penalty\" refers \nonly to those charges that are assessed because of the prepayment in full of a simple-interest obligation, in addition \nto other amounts. Comment 18(k)(1)-1 clarifies that interest charges for any period after prepayment in full is made \nand minimum finance charges are examples of prepayment penalties. The Board is proposing to revise comment \n18(k)(1)-1 for clarity by substituting \"charges determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period \nafter prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such 'balance'\" for \"interest charges for any period after \nprepayment,\" as discussed above. Proposed comments 38(a)(5)-2(i) and (ii) are consistent with comment 18(k)(1)-\n1, as it is proposed to be amended.\n\nProposed comment 38(a)(5)-2(iii) states that origination or other charges that a creditor waives on the condition that \nthe consumer does not prepay the loan are prepayment penalties, for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling. Fees imposed for a preparing a payoff statement and performing other services when a consumer \nprepays the obligation would not be considered a prepayment penalty under the proposed rule, however. Such fees \n\n\n\nare not strictly linked to a consumer's prepaying the obligation, as they are charged at the end of a loan's term as \nwell. The Board solicits comment on this distinction.\n\nFor purposes of some State laws, a minimum finance charge is not considered a prepayment penalty. For purposes \nof disclosure under TILA, a minimum finance charge is considered a prepayment penalty. Existing comment \n18(k)(1)-1 and proposed comment 38(a)(5)-2 are designed to promote clear, consistent disclosure of charges \ncreditors may impose when a consumer prepays the obligation in full. The proposed rule would not preempt State \nlaws unless State law disclosure requirements are inconsistent with the rule, and then only to the extent of any \ninconsistency.\n\nExisting comment 17(a)(1)-5(vii) allows creditors to disclose that the borrower may pay a minimum finance charge \nas information directly related to the penalty disclosure. Further, if a State or federal law prohibits creditors from \ncharging a prepayment penalty but permits the charging of interest for some period after the consumer prepays \nfrom that prohibition, existing comment 17(a)(1)-5(xi) permits creditors to disclose that a consumer may have to pay \ninterest for some period after prepayment as information directly related to the prepayment penalty disclosure. \nComments 17(a)(1)-5(vii) and (xi), together with other commentary in comment 17(a)(1)-5, would not apply to \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling, as discussed above.\n\nExisting comment 18(k)(1)-1 states that loan guarantee fees are examples of charges that are not penalties. The \nBoard proposes to retain this example in comment 38(a)(5)-2. (In a separate rulemaking, the Board proposed to \nremove the example of interim interest on a student loan as an example of charges that are not penalties. See 74 \nFR 12464, 12469; Mar. 29, 2009.)\n\nDisclosed as applicable; disclosure content. Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-4 clarifies that if no prepayment penalty \napplies, creditors need not disclose that fact in the \"Loan Summary\" section of transaction-specific disclosures. \nProposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(iii) requires creditors to disclose whether or not the legal obligation permits the creditor to \ncharge a prepayment penalty in the \"Key Questions about Risk\" section, however. Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-5 \nclarifies that creditors must disclose the maximum penalty as a numerical amount. This is consistent with the \ngeneral rule of construction of the word \"amount\" required by \u00a7 226.2(b)(5).\n\nBasis of disclosure. Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-6 explains how creditors determine the maximum penalty amount \nand contains examples that illustrate how those principles are applied. (Proposed comment 38(d)(1)(iii) states that \ncreditors may rely on proposed comment 38(a)(5)-6 in determining the maximum prepayment penalty to be \ndisclosed as one of the \"Key Questions about Risk\" disclosures.) Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-6 states that in all \ncases, the creditor should assume that the consumer prepays at a time when the prepayment penalty may be \ncharged. The comment also states that if more than one type of prepayment penalty applies (for example, if the \nloan includes a minimum finance charge and the creditor may collect interest after prepayment), the creditor should \ninclude the maximum amount of each type of prepayment penalty in determining the maximum penalty possible.\n\nExisting comment 18(k)(1)-1 clarifies that interest charges for any period after a consumer prepays in full and a \nminimum finance charge in a simple interest transaction are deemed to be prepayment penalties. Proposed \ncomment 38(a)(5)-6(i) and (ii) clarifies that the amount of such charges must be counted in determining the \nmaximum penalty.\n\nProposed comment 38(a)(5)-6(iii) provides examples of how creditors may calculate a maximum prepayment \npenalty where the creditor determines the penalty by applying a constant rate to the loan balance at the time of \nprepayment. In such cases, the prepayment penalty amount is largest when the balance is as high as possible. \nProposed comment 38(a)(5)-6(iv) illustrates a method creditors could use to approximate the maximum penalty \nwhere the penalty amount depends on both the loan balance and the time at which the consumer prepays (for \nexample, where a prepayment penalty on an adjustable-rate loan equals six months' interest payments). If the \npenalty amount depends on both the loan balance and the time at which the consumer prepays, under the \nproposed rule creditors would disclose the greater of (1) the penalty charged when the balance is the highest \npossible and (2) the penalty charged when the penalty rate is the highest possible (two-stage penalty calculation).\n\n\n\nThe two-stage penalty calculation produces an amount that approximates, but does not necessarily equal, the \nmaximum prepayment penalty. The Board believes, however, that the amount determined using the two-stage \npenalty calculation ordinarily will be sufficiently close to the actual maximum prepayment penalty that it would be \nappropriate for creditors to use the method in complying with \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) and (d)(1)(iii). The Board solicits \ncomment on whether the Board should permit creditors to use the two-stage penalty calculation where the penalty \nrate increases. Will this \"two-stage penalty calculation\" method produce a prepayment penalty amount that \nsufficiently approximates the maximum prepayment penalty possible for a loan? Are there cases where there will be \na significant disparity between the maximum penalty determined using the two-stage penalty calculation and the \nactual maximum penalty?\n\nNeither the simple penalty calculation nor the two-stage penalty calculation will enable the creditor to determine the \nmaximum penalty where the penalty rate on a negatively amortizing loan declines. In such a case, the creditor must \ndetermine the maximum prepayment penalty by determining what the penalty would be at each point during the \nloan term while the penalty is in effect.\n\nRequiring all creditors to base maximum penalty disclosures on the foregoing rules ensures standardization of \ndisclosures. Allowing creditors to select their own assumptions about when consumers are likely to prepay would \nresult in inconsistencies among the disclosures given by different creditors. The Board considered other \napproaches, such as requiring creditors to disclose the maximum prepayment penalty based on a single \nhypothetical point in time (for example, one year after origination). However, this approach would understate the \namount consumers who prepay earlier would have to pay.\n\nTimely payment assumed. Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-7 states that creditors may assume that the consumer \nmakes payments on time and may disregard any possible inaccuracies resulting from consumers' payment \npatterns. This is consistent with existing comment 17(c)(2)(i)-3 and proposed clarifications in comment 17(c)(1)-1. \nProposed comment 38(a)(5)-7 further clarifies that where the payment required by a legal obligation's terms is not a \nfully amortizing payment, the creditor must base disclosures on the required periodic payment and may not assume \nthat the consumer will make payments that exceed the required payment.\n\n38(b) Annual Percentage Rate\n\nThe Board proposes to improve the APR's utility to consumers by making it a more inclusive measure of the cost of \ncredit, as discussed under \u00a7 226.4, and also by improving the manner in which the APR is disclosed on the TILA \nstatement. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(1) would require the APR to be disclosed, using the term \"annual percentage \nrate\" and with the description, \"overall cost of this loan including interest and settlement charges.\" Proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(b)(2) would require creditors to show the APR plotted on a graph, relative to (1) the \"average prime offer \nrate\" (APOR) for borrowers with excellent credit for a comparable loan type, in the week in which the disclosure is \nprovided, and (2) the higher-priced loan threshold under \u00a7 226.35(a). 72 Proposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(3) would require an \nexplanation of the APOR and higher-priced threshold. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(4) would require creditors to disclose \nthe average per-period savings from a 1 percentage-point reduction in the disclosed APR. Certain loans, including \nconstruction loans, would be excluded from proposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(2) and (b)(3).\n\nCurrent Rules\n\n72 The Board issued \u00a7 226.35(a) in its 2008 HOEPA Final Rule; compliance with \u00a7 226.35(a) is mandatory beginning on October \n1, 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFor closed-end credit, TILA Section 128(a)(4) and (a)(8) require creditors to disclose the \"annual percentage rate,\" \nusing that term, together with a brief description such as \"the cost of your credit as a yearly rate.\" 15 U.S.C. \n1638(a)(4), (a)(8). Section 226.18(e) implements these requirements. As discussed in proposed \u00a7 226.37, TILA \nSection 122 and \u00a7 226.17(a) require the APR, with the finance charge, to be more conspicuous than other \ndisclosures except the disclosure of the creditor's identity. Changes to the requirements of \u00a7 226.17(a) are \ndiscussed under \u00a7 226.37.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe APR is the only single, unified number available to help consumers understand the overall cost of a loan. 73 15 \nU.S.C. 1638(a)(4). Before enactment of TILA in 1968, creditors could advertise a 6 percent loan rate, but were \nallowed to calculate the interest charged to the consumer by using a simple interest, an add-on, or a discount rate \nmethod. 74 Although the advertised loan rate would appear the same, the amount of interest consumers actually \nwould pay over the loan term would differ greatly under each of these calculation methods. 75 In addition, \nconsumers were forced to evaluate different components of a loan's costs, such as interest rate, points, and closing \ncosts, when comparing competing loan offers. The APR standardizes the interest rate calculation and seeks to \ncapture the overall cost of the credit offered so that consumers can compare competing loan more easily than if \nthey had to evaluate the relationship and impact of different loan costs themselves. 76\n\nParticipants in the Board's consumer testing generally did not understand the APR and often mistook it for the \nloan's interest rate. 77 The Board tested alternative descriptive statements and formats for the APR, but consumers \ncontinued to be confused by the APR. For example, some participants thought the APR reflected future \nadjustments to the interest rate, or the maximum possible interest rate for a variable rate loan. A few participants \nrecognized that the APR differed from the interest rate, but were unable to articulate the reason. In addition, when \npresented with two hypothetical loan offers, participants did not use the APR to compare and choose between the \noffers. Instead, participants chose a loan based on one or more of the following pieces of information: the interest \nrate, monthly payment, and settlement costs.\n\nThe Board's Proposal\n\nThe Board proposes to retain the APR disclosure, with several changes designed to improve the APR's utility for \nconsumers. These proposed changes would apply only to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a \n\n73 The1998 Joint Report at 8; see also Bd. Of Governors of Fed. Res. Sys., 1996 Report to Congress: Finance Charges for \nConsumer Credit under the Truth in Lending Act at (April 1996).\n\n74 The1998 Joint Report at 8.\n\n75 Id.\n\n76 Id.\n\n \n\n \n\n77 See also Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosures at 35 (finding that most respondents in consumer testing did not \nunderstand or were confused by the APR and generally mistook it for the contract interest rate).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ndwelling. First, the Board proposes to revise the description to use simpler terminology. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(1) \nwould require creditors to disclose the APR, expressed as a percentage, together with a statement that it \nrepresents the overall cost of the loan, including interest and settlement charges. As discussed under \u00a7 226.4, the \nBoard also proposes to make the APR more inclusive of the cost of credit. Moreover, under \u00a7 226.38(c), the interest \nrate would be disclosed on the form, which would help some consumers understand that the APR does not \nrepresent the interest rate.\n\nSecond, the proposed rule also would require creditors to disclose the APR using a graph that shows the \nconsumer how the APR for the loan offered would compare to the average prime offer rate and the threshold for \nhigher-priced loans under \u00a7 226.35(a). This disclosure would help consumers understand how the APR on the loan \noffered to them compares to APRs offered to borrowers with excellent credit for a similar loan type, and higher-\npriced loans which generally are made to borrowers who present higher risk. Such borrowers include those with \nblemished credit histories, or with high loan-to-value ratios.\n\nThe Board's consumer testing shows that consumers do not understand the APR's utility. Testing the APR with \ndifferent names and descriptions did not measurably increase consumers' understanding of the APR. Although the \nAPR was designed in part to facilitate comparison of competing loan products, testing suggests that most \nconsumers do not compare competing loans by APR, probably because they receive only one TILA disclosure \nbefore they consummate a loan. If consumers comparison shop for a loan, they do so before they apply for a loan \nand likely shop based on oral quotes of interest rates and points.\n\nThe Board's testing suggests that with little understanding of the APR and no ready and appropriate basis for \ncomparison, many consumers ignore the APR in favor of information they find more accessible, such as the loan's \nmonthly payment or settlement costs. Therefore, the Board is taking two steps to improve the disclosure of the \nAPR. The first step is designed to draw consumers' attention to the APR. To do so, the Board proposes to require \ndisclosure of the consumer's APR on a graph to highlight the APR and distinguish it from other numerical \ndisclosures, including the interest rate. Consumers would be more likely to notice the APR plotted on the graph, in a \nprominent location on the disclosure statement. Principles of consumer design provide that a graphic device \naccommodates different learning styles. And, consumer research has shown that use of graphics or similar visual \ndevices help consumers attend to or notice important information. 78\n\nThe Board's next proposed step is to present the APR in a context that is designed to facilitate understanding of the \nAPR. The Board believes that consumers would be more likely to use the APR if it is shown to them in context of \nother rates, rather than in isolation as is presently often the case. Research on consumer behavior suggests that \nconsumer choice is affected by whether a consumer is presented with a single option for a product or multiple \noptions. Consumers making a choice in the presence of more than one option are more likely to make a selection \nbased on the relative merits of the options presented, rather than on their own existing \"references\" for the value of \nthe product. 79 Here, the Board believes that presenting consumers with information about other rates, current as of \n\n78 Kozup, John, Elizabeth Howlett, and Michael Pagano. 2008. \"The Effects of Summary Information on Consumer Perception of \nMutual Fund Characteristics.\"The Journal of Consumer Affairs, vol. 42. See also Testimony of John Kozup, Assistant Professor, \nDepartment of Marketing, and Director, Center for Marketing and Public Policy, Villanova University; \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/events/publichearings/hoepa/2006/20060711/transcript.pdf .\n\n \n\n \n\n79 See, e.g., Hsee, Christopher K. and France Leclerc. 1988. \"Will Products Look More Attractive When Presented Separately or \nTogether?\" Journal of Consumer Research, vol. 25.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/events/publichearings/hoepa/2006/20060711/transcript.pdf\n\n\nthe week of the consumer's application, would help consumers make more informed decisions about the loan \noffered.\n\nTesting suggests that showing the consumer the APR in context of information about other APRs would result in \nconsumer benefits. For example, the APR graph would cause consumers to ask the creditor questions about the \nrate offered to them and when applicable, why it differs from the average APR offered to borrowers with excellent \ncredit histories. The proposed APR disclosure would enable consumers to determine whether they are being \noffered a loan that comports with their creditworthiness. A borrower who knows his or her credit history is excellent \nor very good would be informed that the loan offered is higher-priced. Participants in the Board's testing stated that \nif they knew they had excellent credit, they would ask the lender why they were being offered a higher-priced loan \nand what they would need to do to get a better offer. The Board notes that some participants indicated that the \ndisclosed APR, even if higher-priced, was lower than the interest rate on their current loan and thus was attractive \nto them. Nevertheless, while some consumers may not be prompted by the APR graph to seek information about \nimproved loan terms, testing suggests others may do so and benefit as a result.\n\nThe Board recognizes that not all consumers are aware of their credit history, and thus may not be able to assess \nwhether the loan offered is consistent with their credit standing. The Board anticipates that the APR graph would \ncause some consumers to investigate their credit reports. If there are errors, these consumers could take steps to \nresolve the errors. If consumers in fact have impaired credit, some consumers might consider whether to delay \nseeking a loan until they could repair their credit standing.\n\nIn some instances the APR graph may be potentially confusing. That is, a loan may be a higher-priced loan for \nreasons other than the borrower's credit history. For example, a consumer might have little home equity, resulting in \na high loan-to-value ratio and a higher APR. The Board believes that even in such cases, the APR graph \nnonetheless would be beneficial to consumers. It would prompt the consumer to ask questions, and creditors \nshould be able to explain to consumers why the APR on a loan is higher-priced. In many cases the explanation may \nhelp the consumer determine whether they could take steps to get a lower APR. For example, if the creditor \nexplains that the offered loan is a higher-priced loan because of a low down-payment, the borrower would be \nalerted that providing a larger down payment would result in a reduced APR and cost savings.\n\nThe Board also notes that certain loans may be higher-priced loans simply because of the loan type. For example, \nloans that exceed the threshold amount for eligibility for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, known as \n\"nonconforming\" or \"jumbo loans,\" may tend to be higher-priced loans because of the method for calculating the \nAPOR. The APOR is the average APR for conforming loans offered to borrowers with excellent credit. In the case \nof such loans, creditors would have to explain to consumers why the loan's APR is higher-priced.\n\nThird, the proposal would require the creditor to disclose the average per-period savings from a 1 percentage-point \nreduction in the disclosed APR. The Board believes that showing consumers the relationship between the APR \nand a concrete dollar figure would help make the possible benefits of obtaining better loan terms more concrete for \nconsumers. Showing potential savings that could result from a lower APR would help encourage consumers to \nshop and negotiate for better loan terms, or as discussed, to increase their downpayment, resolve errors in their \ncredit report, or seek to improve their credit standing.\n\n38(b)(2)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(2) would require a graph indicating the consumer's APR within a range of APRs beginning \nwith the average prime offer rate (\"APOR\"), as defined in \u00a7 226.35(a)(2), including the higher-priced mortgage loan \nthreshold, as defined in \u00a7 226.35(a)(1), and terminating four percentage points greater than the higher-priced \n\n \n\n\n\nmortgage loan threshold. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(3) would require a statement of the APOR as defined in \u00a7 \n226.35(a)(2), and the higher-priced mortgage loan threshold, as defined in \u00a7 226.35(a)(1), current as of the week \nthe disclosure is produced. The graphic would contain different shaded areas using different scales for the range \nbetween the APOR and the higher-priced mortgage loan threshold, and for the range above the higher-priced \nmortgage loan threshold. The graphic would also label the range above the higher-priced mortgage loan threshold \nas the \"high-cost zone.\"\n\nCreditors would use the Board's table of average prime offer rates to find the APOR for the loan type that matches \nthe loan being disclosed, for the week in which the creditor provides the disclosure. Creditors would follow the \nBoard's guidance in commentary to \u00a7 226.35(a) in determining how to select the appropriate APOR. In the text \nexplaining the APOR, creditors may include a statement clarifying that the APOR is for conforming loans only.\n\nThe Board requests comment on any potential operational difficulty in producing the graph proposed in \u00a7 \n226.38(b)(2) in an accurate and timely manner. Comment is also sought on whether a different graphical device \nwould better draw consumers' attention to the APR and illustrate the APR's utility to consumers.\n\n38(b)(3)\n\nTo help consumers navigate the information provided by the graph, proposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(3) would require an \nexplanation of the average prime offer rate as defined in \u00a7 226.35(a)(2), and the higher-priced mortgage loan \nthreshold, as defined in \u00a7 226.35(a)(1). Participants in the Board's consumer testing found this statement helpful in \nunderstanding the information in the graph.\n\n38(b)(4)\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(b)(4) would provide how creditors must calculate the average per-period savings that would \nresult from a 1 percentage-point reduction in the APR. (This discussion refers to monthly savings because most \nmortgage loans require monthly payments.) Creditors would calculate the average per-month savings by reducing \nthe interest rate (or rates in the case of an ARM, as discussed in comment 34(b)(4)-1) by 1 percentage point, \ncomputing a hypothetical total of payments reflecting the payment schedule at the lower rate or rates. The creditor \nwould divide the difference between (1) the total of payments disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i), and (2) \nthe hypothetical total of payments by the number of payment periods required under the terms of the legal \nobligation. The creditor would report the results of this calculation as the average savings each month from a 1 \npercentage-point reduction in the APR. Proposed comment 38(b)(4)-1 would provide guidance on this method, and \nwould include examples for fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nThe Board notes that the proposed method does not result in an exact 1 percentage-point reduction in APR, but is \nlikely to be within a few basis points of a 1 percentage-point reduction. The results would be sufficiently accurate to \nshow consumers that a lower APR will yield savings. Methods that might result in an actual 1 percentage-point \nreduction in the APR would likely be more complicated and would vary depending on the terms of the loan, such as \nwhether the rate is variable and whether the payments amortize the loan. The Board believes that any additional \nconsumer benefit from disclosing the precise 1 percentage-point APR reduction would not be sufficient to offset the \ncosts of a more complex calculation method. The Board seeks comment, however, on its proposed method and \nwhether another method would achieve the objectives of the disclosure without imposing undue compliance \nburdens.\n\n38(b)(5) Exemptions\n\nProposed section 226.38(b)(5) would exempt construction loans, bridge loans, and reverse mortgages from the \nrequirement to show the APR plotted on a graph (\u00a7 226.38(b)(2)) and the statement of the APOR and the higher-\npriced loan threshold (\u00a7 226.38(b)(3)). The exempted transactions are also exempt from the definition of a higher-\npriced mortgage, under \u00a7 226.35(a)(3) in the Board's 2008 HOEPA Final Rule. The Board does not publish an \n\n\n\naverage prime offer rate for construction, bridge, or reverse mortgage loans. Thus, an exemption seems \nappropriate. The Board seeks comment, however, on whether these transactions should nevertheless be subject to \n\u00a7 226.38(b)(2) and (3).\n\n38(c) Interest Rate and Payment Summary\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(c) provides requirements for disclosure of the contract interest rate and the periodic payment for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The information proposed to be required by this paragraph must \nbe in the form of a table, as provided in \u00a7 226.38(c)(1), substantially similar to Model Forms H--19(A), H--19(B), or \nH--19(C) in Appendix H. Additional formatting requirements would be provided in \u00a7 226.37. The rules for disclosing \nthe interest rate and periodic payments for an amortizing loan are provided in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i) and \n226.38(c)(3). Rules for disclosing the interest rate and periodic payments for a loan with negative amortization are \nin proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii) and 226.38(c)(4). Special rules for disclosing balloon payments are found in \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(5). Additional explanations of introductory rates and negative amortization are contained in \nproposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(iii) and 226.38(c)(6), respectively. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(7) provides definitions for certain \nterms used in \u00a7 226.38(c).\n\nExisting Requirements for Periodic Payments\n\nTILA Section 128(a)(6) requires the creditor to disclose the number, amount, and due dates or period of payments \nscheduled to repay the total of payments, for closed-end credit. 15 U.S.C. 1648(a)(6). Currently, \u00a7 226.18(g) \nimplements TILA 128(a)(6). Under \u00a7 226.18(g), creditors must show the number, amounts, and timing of payments \nscheduled to repay the obligation, except as provided in \u00a7 226.18(g)(2) for certain loans with varying payments. 80 \nThe creditor must provide these disclosures on the TILA statement within three business days of receiving the \nconsumer's written application, as provided in \u00a7 226.19(a).\n\nComment 18(g)-1 provides that the payment schedule should include all components of the finance charge, not just \ninterest. Thus, if mortgage insurance is required, the payment schedule must reflect the consumer's mortgage \ninsurance payments until the date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable \nlaw. See comment 18(g)-5. Commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c) provides that for an adjustable-rate loan, creditors should \ndisclose the payments and other disclosures based only on the initial rate and should not assume that the rate will \nincrease. However, the disclosures must reflect a discounted or premium initial interest rate for as long as it is \ncharged. The commentary permits, but does not require, creditors to include in the payments amounts that are not \nfinance charges or part of the amount financed. Thus, creditors may, but need not, include insurance premiums \nexcluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(d), and \"real estate escrow amounts such as taxes added to the \npayment in mortgage transactions.\"\n\nTILA Section 128(b)(2)(C), as recently added by the MDIA, requires additional disclosures for loans secured by a \ndwelling in which the interest rate or payments may vary. 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2)(C). Specifically, creditors must \nprovide \"examples of adjustments to the regular required payment on the extension of credit based on the change \nin the interest rates specified by the contract for such extension of credit. Among the examples required * * * is an \nexample that reflects the maximum payment amount of the regular required payments on the extension of credit, \nbased on the maximum interest rate allowed under the contract. * * *\" TILA Section 128(b)(2)(C), 15 U.S.C. \n\n80 For a mortgage transaction with rates or fees that exceed certain thresholds, TILA Section 129 requires special disclosures \nregarding payments three business days before consummation of the transaction. See \u00a7 226.32(c)(3), (4). The Board is not \nproposing revisions to these disclosures.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1638(b)(2)(C). Creditors must provide these disclosures within three business days of receipt of the consumer's \nwritten application, as provided in \u00a7 226.19(a). TILA Section 128(b)(2)(C) provides that these examples must be in \nconspicuous type size and format and that the payment schedule be labeled \"Payment Schedule: Payments Will \nVary Based on Interest Rate Changes.\" Section 128(b)(2)(C) requires the Board to conduct consumer testing to \ndetermine the appropriate format for providing the disclosures to consumers so that the disclosures can be easily \nunderstood, including the fact that the initial regular payments are for a specific time period that will end on a certain \ndate, that payments will adjust afterwards potentially to a higher amount, and that there is no guarantee that the \nborrower will be able to refinance to a lower amount. 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2)(C).\n\nThe Board's Proposal\n\nThe Board proposes to add new \u00a7 226.38(c) to implement TILA Section 128(a)(6) and Section 128(b)(2)(C) for all \nclosed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. 81 (For all other closed-end credit transactions, \u00a7 \n226.18(g) would continue to provide the rules for disclosing payments). Section 226.38(c) would require creditors to \ndisclose the contract interest rate, regular periodic payment, and balloon payment if applicable. For adjustable-rate \nor step-rate amortizing loans, up to three interest rates and corresponding monthly payments would be required, \nincluding the maximum possible interest rate and payment. If payments are scheduled to increase independent of \nan interest-rate adjustment, the increased payment must be disclosed. Payments for amortizing loans must include \nan itemized estimate of the amount for taxes and insurance if the creditor will establish an escrow account. If a \nborrower may make one or more payments of interest only, all payments disclosed must be itemized to show the \namount that will be applied to interest and the amount that will be applied to principal. Special rate and payment \ndisclosures would be required for loans with negative amortization. Creditors must provide the information about \ninterest rates and payments in the form of a table, and creditors would not be permitted to include other unrelated \ninformation in the table.\n\nScope of proposed \u00a7 226.38(c). TILA Section 128(b)(2)(C) applies to all transactions secured by a dwelling. The \nBoard proposes to expand the requirement in Section 128(b)(2)(C) to include loans secured by real property that do \nnot include a dwelling. As discussed in \u00a7 226.19(a), unimproved real property is likely to be a significant asset for \nmost consumers, and consumers should receive the disclosures required in Section 128(b)(2)(C) before they \nbecome obligated on a loan secured by such an asset. The disclosures would alert consumers to the potential for \ninterest rate and payment increases and help them to determine whether these risks are appropriate to their \ncircumstances.\n\nThe Board proposes this adjustment to TILA Section 128(b)(2)(C) pursuant to its authority under TILA Section \n105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions and adjustments to TILA for \nany class of transactions to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to \ncompare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The \nclass of transactions that would be affected is transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. As discussed, \nproviding examples of increased interest rates and payments would help consumers understand the risks involved \nin certain loans. The Board also proposes to revise the label for the interest rate and payment information from the \nstatutory language, \"Payment Schedule: Payments Will Vary Based on Interest Rate Changes,\" based on plain \nlanguage principles, to make the disclosure more readily understandable.\n\n81 TILA Section 128(b)(2)(C) also provides that the Board's testing should ensure that consumers can understand that there is no \nguarantee that they will be able to refinance. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(3) implements this aspect of Section 128(b)(2)(C).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDisclosure of the interest rate. Currently, TILA does not require disclosure of the contract interest rate for closed-\nend credit. In the consumer testing conducted for the Board, when consumers were asked what factors they \nconsidered when looking for a mortgage, by far the most common answers were that they wanted to obtain the \nlowest interest rate possible and that they wanted the loan with the lowest possible monthly payment. However, as \nthey described their thought process, most consumers were primarily focused on the initial rate and payment, rather \nthan how those terms might vary over time. Testing conducted on the current transaction-specific TILA disclosures \nindicated that consumers would like to see the interest rate disclosed on the form.\n\nIn addition, testing indicated that the current TILA payment schedule, which does not show the relationship \nbetween interest rate and payment, is ineffective at communicating to consumers what could happen to their \npayments over time on an ARM. Most participants said they liked the current presentation of the payments because \nit was specific and detailed. However, when shown a payment schedule for an ARM with an introductory rate, \nmany incorrectly assumed that payments shown were in fact their future payments, rather than payments based on \nthe fully-indexed rate at consummation.\n\nUnder the Board's proposal, the interest rate and payment would be shown together in a table. The Board believes \nthat highlighting the relationship between the interest rate and payment will enhance consumers' understanding of \nloan terms. If the interest rate is adjustable, the table would indicate changes in the adjustable interest rate over \ntime. In addition, payment changes that are not based on adjustments to the interest rate would also be indicated in \nthe table. Highlighting potential changes to the interest rate and payment based on maximum interest rate \nincreases, rather than showing a set payment schedule based on the assumption that the index used to calculate a \nadjustable interest rate will not change, will clarify to consumers not only that their interest rate and payments may \nchange, but also how the interest rate and payment may change over time. Consumers would be better able to \ndetermine if a adjustable rate or payment loan will be affordable and appropriate for their individual circumstances.\n\nDefinitions for \u00a7 226.38(c). Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c) uses several terms that are defined in proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(7). \nUnder \u00a7 226.38(c)(7), the terms \"adjustable-rate mortgage,\" \"step-rate mortgage,\" and \"interest-only\" would have \nthe same meanings as in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3). An \"amortizing loan\" would be defined as a loan in which the regular \nperiodic payments cannot cause the principal balance to increase; the term \"negative amortization\" would mean a \nloan in which the regular periodic payments may cause the principal balance to increase. Finally, the tern \"fully-\nindexed rate\" would mean the interest rate calculated using the index value and margin.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i) and (c)(3) would require disclosure of interest rates and payment amounts for amortizing \nloans. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(7) defines an amortizing loan as one in which the regular periodic payments cannot \ncause the principal balance to increase. Thus, loans with interest-only payments are amortizing loans. If an escrow \naccount will be established for an amortizing loan, creditors would be required to itemize the payment to show \namounts to be included for taxes and insurance. See proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(C). Proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii) \nand 226.38(c)(4) would require a special table for disclosures of interest rates and payment amounts for negatively \namortizing loans. For such loans in which the consumer may choose between several payment options, the table \nwill show only two: the minimum required payment option, and the fully amortizing option. Creditors may, however, \ndisclose other payment options to the consumer, outside the segregated information required by this section.\n\n38(c)(1) Format\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(1) would require the interest rate and payment information to be disclosed in the form of a \ntable. This would ensure that payment examples required by the MDIA are in conspicuous format as required by \nTILA Section 128(b)(2)(C). The MDIA also requires conspicuous type size for the examples. Under the proposal, all \ndisclosures must be in a minimum 10 point font, including the table required under \u00a7 226.38(c), to ensure that they \nare clear and conspicuous. See proposed \u00a7 226.37(a).\n\nThe Board's proposal would prescribe the number of interest rates and payments that could be shown in a table. \nThe number of columns and rows for the table required by this part would vary depending on whether the loan is an \namortizing loan and whether it has adjustable rates. However, tables disclosed under this section would have no \n\n\n\nmore than 5 columns across, and creditors would not include information in the table that is not required under \n226.38(c), to avoid information overload. Model and Sample Forms would be provided in Appendix H.\n\n38(c)(2) Interest Rates\n\n38(c)(2)(i) Amortizing Loans\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i) would provide disclosure of interest rates for amortizing loans. For a fixed-rate mortgage \nwith no scheduled payment increases or balloon payments, the creditor would disclose only one interest rate. \nFixed-rate loans with payment increases would require the creditor to disclose the interest rate with each increase. \nFor adjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages, more than one interest rate must be shown, as discussed \nbelow.\n\nInterest Rates for Fixed-Rate Mortgages\n\nFor fixed-rate mortgages, proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)(A) would require creditors to disclose the interest rate \napplicable at consummation. If the transaction does not provide for any payment increases, only one interest rate \nwould be disclosed. However, some fixed-rate mortgages will have scheduled payment increases and in those \ncases the creditor must show the interest rate again, even though it is redundant, as discussed under \u00a7 \n226.38(c)(2)(i)(C) below.\n\nInterest Rates for Adjustable-Rate Mortgages and Step-Rate Mortgages\n\nInterest rates at consummation, maximum possible at first adjustment, and maximum possible interest rate. As \ndiscussed, TILA Section 128(b)(2)(C) requires creditors to disclose examples of payment increases including the \nmaximum possible payment, for adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgages where payments may vary. Under \u00a7 \n226.38(c)(2)(i), creditors would disclose more than one interest rate and corresponding monthly payment for \nadjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)A)(I), the creditor must \nprovide the interest rate at consummation, and the period of time until the first adjustment. If the interest rate at \nconsummation is less than the fully-indexed rate (the sum of the index and margin at consummation), the interest \nrate must be labeled as \"introductory.\" Additional explanation of discounted introductory rates is required in \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(iii), as discussed below.\n\nMaximum at first adjustment. The Board proposes to require disclosure of the maximum rate and payment at first \nadjustment, as one of the examples required by TILA Section 128(b)(2)(C). Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)(B)(1) \nrequires the creditor to provide the maximum interest rate applicable at the first interest rate adjustment, and the \ncalendar month and year in which the first scheduled adjustment occurs would be required to be disclosed. The \ncreditor would take into account any limitations on interest rate increases when determining the interest rate to be \ndisclosed under \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)(B)(2). If the interest rate may reach the maximum possible at the first adjustment, \nthe creditor should disclose the rate as the maximum possible as discussed below.\n\nThe Board proposes to require disclosure of the maximum interest rate at first adjustment because many \nconsumers may take out adjustable-rate mortgages, planning to sell the home or refinance the loan before the first \ninterest rate adjustment. It is important for consumers to know how much their rate and payment might increase at \nthat point, if they are unable to refinance or sell the home before the first adjustment. The Board believes that for \nthe same reason, the first interest rate increase should be shown for step-rate mortgages. Although such \nmortgages do not present the uncertainty that an adjustable-rate mortgage does, consumers need to be informed of \nwhat their rate will increase to at the first increase. Consumer testing conducted for the Board shows that most \nconsumers would find this information useful in determining whether the loan is affordable and suitable to their \nneeds.\n\n\n\nMaximum possible interest rate. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)(B)(3) would require creditors to disclose the maximum \ninterest rate that could apply, and the earliest possible year in which that rate could apply, as required by TILA \nSection 128(b)(2)(C). The Board proposes to require this disclosure for step-rate mortgages as well, because the \nrate and payment will increase in such loans. Consumer testing conducted for the Board suggests that consumers \nfind this information about the maximum rate and payment particularly important in evaluating a loan offer for an \nadjustable-rate mortgage. Participants indicated that this information is most useful to them in determining whether \nsuch a loan was affordable. If an amortizing adjustable-rate mortgage has intermediate limitation on interest rate \nincreases, then the table required by proposed \u00a7 226.38(c) would have at least three columns; if the transaction has \nno intermediate limitation on interest rates then the table would have two columns, one showing the rate at \nconsummation and the other showing the maximum possible under the loan's terms.\n\nInterest rate applicable at scheduled payment increase. Some mortgages provide for a payment increase that is not \nattributable to an interest rate adjustment or increase. For example, a loan may permit the borrower to make \npayments that cover only accrued interest for some specified period, such as the first five years following \nconsummation; at the end of this \"interest-only\" period, the borrower must begin making larger payments to cover \nboth interest accrued and principal. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)(C) would provide that, where such an increase will \nnot coincide with an interest rate adjustment or increase, the creditor must include a column that discloses the \ninterest rate that would apply at the time the adjustment is scheduled to occur, and the date in which the increase \nwould occur. The creditor must include a description such as \"first increase\" or \"first adjustment.\" Thus, for a fixed-\nrate mortgage, the creditor would show the same interest rate twice (and the corresponding payments as \ndiscussed in \u00a7 226.38(c)(4) below). The Board believes this would help the consumer understand that the increase \nin payment is due to the requirement to begin repaying loan principal and not to an interest-rate adjustment.\n\nThe same is true for adjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages. For example, some adjustable-rate \nmortgages permit the borrower to make interest-only payments for a specified period, such as the first five years \nfollowing consummation. A scheduled payment increase may or may not coincide with a scheduled interest rate \nadjustment. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)(C), if a scheduled payment increase does not coincide with an \ninterest rate adjustment (or rate increase for a step-rate mortgage), creditors must include a column that discloses \nthe interest rate that would apply at the time of the increase, the date the increase is scheduled to occur, and an \nappropriate description such as \"first increase\" or \"first adjustment\" as appropriate. Proposed comment \n38(c)(2)(i)(C)-1 provides clarifying examples. The Board is not aware of step-rate loans with interest-only features; \nhowever, if such a loan is offered, creditors would disclose the payment increase in the same manner as for an \nadjustable-rate mortgage.\n\n38(c)(2)(ii) Negative Amortization Loans\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii) would require disclosure of the interest rate applicable at consummation. Many payment \noption loans do not provide any limitations on interest rate increases (\"interest rate caps\"); the only cap is the \nmaximum possible interest rate required by \u00a7 226.30(a.) For payment option loans, the creditor would disclose the \ninterest rate in effect at consummation, and assume that the interest rate reaches the maximum at the next \nadjustment--often the second month after consummation. The creditor would disclose that rate for the first and \nsecond scheduled payment increases, as explained more fully in \u00a7 226.38(c)(4) below, and in the last column, \nwhen the loan has recast and the consumer must first make a fully amortizing payment. The proposed approach to \ninterest rates for negative amortization loans is consistent with the MDIA, which requires disclosure of the payment \nat the maximum possible rate, and other examples of payment increases.\n\nAdditional proposed rules for disclosing the interest rate on a loan with negative amortization are discussed under \n38(c)(6) Special Disclosures for Loans with Negative Amortization, below.\n\n38(c)(2)(iii) Introductory Rate Disclosure for Adjustable-Rate Mortgages\n\n\n\nMany adjustable-rate mortgages have an introductory or teaser rate, set below the index and margin used for later \nadjustments. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(iii) would require a special disclosure in the case of an introductory rate. In \nconsumer testing conducted for the Board, many participants did not understand the ramifications of an introductory \ninterest rate. Participants understood that if market interest rates increased, the interest rate and payment on their \nloan would increase. However, participants did not understand that if they had an introductory rate, their interest \nrate and payment would increase when the introductory rate expired, even if market interest rates did not increase. \nSeveral different disclosures designed to show the impact of an introductory rate were tested in tabular form, with \nmixed results. Therefore, the Board proposes to require an explanation of the introductory rate below the table \nitself. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(iii) would require disclosure of the introductory rate, how long it will last, and that the \ninterest rate will increase at the first scheduled adjustment even if market rates do not increase. Creditors would \nalso disclose the fully indexed rate that otherwise would apply at consummation. Proposed \u00a7 226.37(d)(4) would \nprovide that this disclosure must be prominent and placed in a box under the table.\n\n38(c)(3) Payments for Amortizing Loans\n\n38(c)(3)(i) Principal and Interest Payments\n\nSection 226.38(c)(3)(i) would require disclosure of the principal and interest payment that corresponds to each \ninterest rate disclosed under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i). Special itemization of the payment is required, however, if \nthe loan permits the consumer to make any payments that will be applied only to interest accrued. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.3(c)(3)(ii)(C) would require disclosure of an estimate of the amount of taxes and insurance, including mortgage \ninsurance. Proposed \u00a7 226.3(c)(3)(i)(D) would require disclosure of the estimated total payment including principal, \ninterest, and taxes and insurance.\n\nPrincipal and interest payments. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i) would require the disclosure of payment amounts that \ncorrespond to the interest rates disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i). Proposed comment 38(c)(3)-1 would clarify that \nthe interest rate and payment amount applicable at consummation are required to be disclosed for all loans. In \naddition, the comment would clarify that if a payment amount is required to be disclosed under more than one \nsubparagraph, the payment should only be disclosed once. For example, in an adjustable-rate transaction with a \nballoon payment, if the balloon payment will occur at the same time the loan may reach its maximum interest rate, \nonly one disclosure of the interest rate and payment is required. Proposed comment 38(c)(3)-2 provides examples \nof the types of loans that trigger additional payment disclosures.\n\nFixed-rate mortgages. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(A), for fixed-rate transactions where the regular periodic \npayment fully amortizes the loan and there are no scheduled payment increases (such as upon the expiration of an \ninterest-only feature), the payment amount including both principal and interest would be required to be disclosed.\n\nFixed-rate interest-only loans. For fixed-rate transactions in which the consumer may make one or more interest-\nonly payments, proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(B) would require disclosure of the payment at any scheduled increase in \nthe payment amount and the date on which the increase is scheduled to occur. For example, in a fixed-rate interest-\nonly loan a scheduled increase in the payment amount from an interest-only payment to a fully amortizing payment \nwould be required to be disclosed. Similarly, in a fixed-rate balloon loan, the balloon payment must be disclosed, \nbut it would be disclosed under the table pursuant to \u00a7 226.38(c)(5).\n\nAdjustable-rate and step-rate transactions. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i), for adjustable-rate and step-rate \ntransactions, a payment amount corresponding to each interest rate in \u00a7 226.38(c)(2) would be required to be \ndisclosed.\n\nAdjustable-rate interest-only and balloon loans. For adjustable-rate transactions in which the consumer may make \ninterest-only payments, proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(ii) would require additional disclosures. Section 226.38(c)(3)(i)(B) \nwould require disclosure of the payment amount at any scheduled payment increase that does not coincide with an \ninterest rate adjustment, and the date on which the increase is scheduled to occur. In addition, for an adjustable-\nrate balloon loan, if the balloon payment will not coincide with either the first interest rate adjustment or the time \n\n\n\nwhen the interest rate reaches its maximum, the balloon payment is required to be disclosed separately, below the \ntable, in accordance with \u00a7 226.38(c)(5).\n\nPrincipal and interest payment itemization. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i) and (ii), the format of the payment \ndisclosure would vary depending on whether all regular periodic payment amounts will include principal and \ninterest. If all regular periodic payments include principal and interest, under \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i) each payment amount \nwould be listed in a single row in the table with a description such as principal and interest (except that a balloon \npayment would be disclosed in accordance with \u00a7 226.38(c)(5)). If any regular periodic payment amounts will \ninclude interest but not principal, under \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(ii) all payments for the loan must be itemized into principal \nand interest. For a payment that includes no principal, the creditor must indicate that none of the payment amount \nwill be applied to principal. The creditor must label the dollar amount to be applied to interest \"Interest Payment.\" \nThe Board proposes this itemization and labeling to emphasize for consumers the impact of making interest-only \npayments. Many participants in the Board's consumer testing did not clearly understand that an \"interest-only\" loan \nwas different from a loan in which all payments are applied to principal and interest without this emphasis and the \nstatement in the loan summary required in proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(3).\n\nBalloon payment. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(5)(i), if a payment amount is a balloon payment, the payment must \nbe disclosed in the last row of the table rather than in a column, unless it coincides with an interest rate adjustment \nor other payment increase such as the expiration of an interest-only option. Section 226.38(c)(5)(i) would clarify that \na payment is a balloon payment if it is more than twice the amount of other payments. This is consistent with how \nballoon payments are defined for purposes of restrictions on balloon payments for higher-priced and HOEPA loans.\n\nEscrows; mortgage insurance premiums. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(C) would provide that if an escrow account will \nbe established, the creditor must disclose the estimated payment amount for taxes and insurance, including \nmortgage insurance. For transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, creditors would no longer have the \nflexibility provided in existing 226.18(g) to exclude escrow amounts. Consumer testing conducted for the Board \nshows that many consumers compare loans based on the monthly payment amount. The Board believes that in \norder for consumers to fully understand the monthly amount they actually will be required to pay for a particular \nloan, information about payments for taxes and insurance is necessary. Escrow information would be included in \nthe table to make it easier for consumers to identify whether there is an escrow and how much of their payment \nwould apply to the escrow.\n\nProposed comment 38(c)(3)(i)(C)-1 would clarify the types of taxes and insurance that would be required to be \nincluded in the estimate. Proposed comment 38(c)(i)(C)-2 would provide guidance on how to determine the length \nof time for which mortgage insurance payments must be included in the estimate. Under the proposed comment, \nwhich is substantially similar to current comment 18(g)-5, the payment amount should reflect the consumer's \nmortgage insurance payments until the date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under \napplicable law, even though the consumer may have a right to request that the insurance be canceled earlier.\n\nThe Board solicits comment on whether premiums or other amounts for credit life insurance, debt suspension and \ndebt cancellation agreements and other similar products should be included or excluded from the disclosure of \nescrows for taxes and insurance. Including such amounts in the estimated escrow and monthly payment, \nparticularly on the early TILA disclosures delivered within three days of application, may cause some consumers to \nbelieve these products are required as part of the loan agreement. This may affect consumers' ability to weigh the \nrelative merits of credit insurance and other similar products and determine whether the product is appropriate for \ntheir circumstances.\n\nTotal periodic payments. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(D) would require disclosure of the total estimated monthly \npayment. The total estimated monthly payment is the sum of the principal and interest payments and the estimated \ntaxes and insurance payments required to be disclosed in \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(C).\n\n38(c)(4) Periodic Payments for Loans With Negative Amortization\n\n\n\nFor each interest rate disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii), the creditor would disclose a corresponding payment. One \nrow of the table would show the fully amortizing payment for each interest rate; for purposes of calculating these \npayments the creditor would assume the interest rate reaches the maximum at the earliest date, and that the \nconsumer makes only fully amortizing payments. The other row of the table would show the minimum required \npayment for each rate, until the recast point. At the recast point, the minimum payment row would show the fully \namortizing payment. For purposes of the minimum payment row, creditors must assume the interest rate reaches \nthe maximum at the earliest date, and that the consumer makes only the minimum required payment for as long as \npermitted under the terms of the legal obligation.\n\nMinimum payment amounts. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(4)(i)(A) would require disclosure of the minimum required \npayment at consummation. The proposal would require a disclosure of the amount of the minimum payment \napplicable for each interest rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii), and the date. Under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(c)(4)(i)(C), the creditor must provide a statement that the minimum payment will cover only some of the \ninterest accrued and none of the principal, and will cause the principal balance to increase. The Board proposes \nthis required statement to ensure that consumers are informed about the consequences of making minimum \npayments. As stated above, participants in the Board's consumer testing were unfamiliar with the concept of \nnegative amortization and struggled to understand why a loan's balance would increase when payments were \nmade.\n\nPayment increases. As noted above, many payment option loans do not have interest rate caps, and thus the \ninterest rate may reach its maximum possible amount at the first interest rate adjustment. However, such loans may \nhave limits on the amount that the minimum payment may increase following an interest rate adjustment. For \nexample, a minimum payment increase may be limited by a certain percentage, such as 7.5% greater than the \nprevious minimum payment. (Such limits are generally subject to conditions and will not apply either at a specific \ntime, such as at the fifth year of the loan, or when the loan balance reaches a certain maximum.) Under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(c)(2)(ii)(D), if adjustments in the minimum payment amount are limited such that the payment will not fully \namortize the loan even after the interest rate has reached the maximum, a disclosure of the minimum payment \namount at the first and second payment adjustments would be required. That is, in cases where the first interest \nrate adjustment will be the only interest rate adjustment, but payment adjustments will continue to occur before the \nminimum payment recasts to a fully amortizing payment, a disclosure of one additional minimum payment \nadjustment would be required.\n\nFully amortizing payment amount. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(4)(iii) would require disclosure of the amount of the fully \namortizing payment, assuming that the consumer makes only fully amortizing payments beginning at \nconsummation. The fully amortizing payment row must be filled in for each interest rate required to be disclosed \nunder \u00a7 226.38(c)(4)(ii) and (iv). The Board believes that contrasting the fully amortizing payment with the minimum \nrequired payment will help consumers to understand the implications of making the fully amortizing payment and \nthe minimum payment. In consumer testing, participants understood from the table that if they made the fully \namortizing payment each month they would pay their loan off, and that if they instead made the minimum payment \nthey would not pay the loan off and in fact would increase the amount that they owe.\n\nStatement of balance increase and other information. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(4)(vi) would require a statement of the \namount of the increase in the loan's principal balance if the consumer makes only minimum payments and the \nearliest month and year in which the minimum payment will recast to a fully amortizing payment under the terms of \nthe legal obligation, assuming that the interest-rate reaches its maximum at the earliest possible time. As noted, \nparticipants in testing expressed confusion about negative amortization; the Board believes this disclosure and the \nother required disclosures in the table should help consumers understand the risks of making minimum payments.\n\nIn addition, the explanation preceding the table would provide the consumer's option to make fully amortizing \npayments or to make minimum payments, the maximum possible interest rate, the earliest number of months or \nyears in which the interest rate could reach its maximum, and the amount of estimated taxes and insurance \nincluded in each payment disclosed. If the maximum interest rate may be reached in less than a year the statement \nwould be required to provide the number of months after consummation in which the interest rate may reach its \n\n\n\nmaximum, otherwise the statement would provide the number of years. In addition, the creditor would disclose \nwhether an escrow account will be established and if so, an estimate of the amount for taxes and insurance \nincluded in each periodic payment.\n\n38(c)(6) Special Disclosures for Loans With Negative Amortization\n\nSome mortgage transactions permit the borrower to make payments that are insufficient to cover all of the interest \naccrued, and the unpaid interest is added to the loan's balance. Thus, although the borrower is making payments, \nthe loan balance is increasing instead of decreasing. Negative amortization could occur on a fixed-rate mortgage or \nan adjustable-rate mortgage. Mortgages with negative amortization were relatively rare until the early part of this \ndecade, when the \"payment option\" loan began to grow in popularity. 82 Payment option loans have adjustable \nrates, and allow the borrower to choose among up to five monthly payment options, including a minimum payment \nthat would result in negative amortization. Other options would include an interest-only option, a fully amortizing \noption, and the option to make extra payments of principal and pay the loan off early. Typically, payment option \nloans permit consumers to make minimum payments for a limited time, such as for the first five years following \nconsummation or until the loan's principal balance reaches 115 percent of the original balance, whichever occurs \nfirst. Upon either event, the consumer must begin to make fully amortizing payments.\n\nPayment option loans and other nontraditional mortgages can result in significant \"payment shock\" for borrowers, \nparticularly when the loan \"recasts\" and a fully amortizing payment must be made. Concerns about payment shock \nled the Board, OCC, OTS, FDIC and NCUA to propose supervisory guidance on nontraditional mortgages in 2005, \nand issue final guidance in October 2006. 83 The guidance emphasizes that institutions should use prudence in \nunderwriting nontraditional mortgages, and should provide accurate and balanced information to consumers before \nthe consumer is obligated on such a mortgage. The agencies published illustrations to assist financial institutions in \nproviding information that would help consumers understand the risks involved in nontraditional mortgages. 84 \nThose illustrations were not consumer tested.\n\nThe Board's consumer testing indicates that the unusual and complex nature of negative amortization loans \nrequires a different approach to the disclosure of interest rates and payments than for amortizing loans. Nearly all \nparticipants in the Board's consumer testing were unfamiliar with the concept of negative amortization, and \ntechnical explanations of negative amortization proved challenging for them. The Board believes that selected \ninformation about payment option loans may be more effective in conveying the risks of such mortgages than \nextensive text explaining negative amortization and its impact.\n\nAccordingly, the Board developed and tested an interest rate and payment summary table designed to inform \nconsumers about the risks of a payment option loan. The proposed rules would also require disclosure of the \ninterest rate and payment for a loan with negative amortization that is not an adjustable rate mortgage. However, \n\n82 Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks, 71 FR 58609; October 4, 2006.\n\n \n\n \n\n83 Id.\n\n84 72 FR 31825, 318231; Jun. 8, 2007\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nthe Board found no examples of such loans in the marketplace, and seeks comment on whether such loans are \noffered and if so, whether proposed \u00a7 226.38(c) provides sufficient guidance on disclosing such loans.\n\nThe interest rate and payment summary would display only two payment options, even if the terms of the legal \nobligation provide for others, such as an option to make interest-only payments. The table would show only the \noption to make minimum payments that would result in negative amortization, and the option to make fully \namortizing payments. The Board believes that displaying all of the options in the table would have the unintended \nconsequence of confusion and information overload for consumers. Creditors would be free to provide information \non options not displayed in the table, outside the segregated information required under this subsection.\n\nIn addition, to help consumers navigate the information in the table, proposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(6) would require a \nstatement directly above the interest rate and payment summary table explaining that the loan offers payment \noptions. A disclosure of the maximum possible balance would also be required, directly below the table, to help \nensure that consumers understand the nature and risks involved in loans with negative amortization.\n\n38(d) Key Questions About Risk\n\nBased on consumer testing, as discussed in greater detail in \u00a7 226.19(b)(2) above, the Board proposes to require \ncreditors to disclose certain information grouped together under the heading \"Key Questions about Risk,\" using that \nterm. This disclosure would be specific to the loan program for which the consumer applied. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(d)(1) would require the creditor to disclose information about the following three terms: (1) Rate increases, \n(2) payment increases, and (3) prepayment penalties. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2) would require the creditor to \ndisclose information about the following six terms, but only if they are applicable to the loan program: (1) interest-\nonly payments, (2) negative amortization, (3) balloon payment, (4) demand feature, (5) no-documentation or low-\ndocumentation loans, and (6) shared-equity or shared-appreciation. The \"Key Questions about Risk\" disclosure \nwould be subject to special format requirements, including a tabular format and a question and answer format, as \ndescribed under proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(3).\n\n38(d)(1) Required Disclosures\n\nAs noted above, proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(1) would require the creditor to disclose information about the following \nthree terms: (1) Rate increases, (2) payment increases, and (3) prepayment penalties. The Board believes that \nthese three factors should always be disclosed. Rate and payment increases pose the most direct risk of payment \nshock. In addition, consumer testing consistently showed that interest rate and monthly payment were the two most \ncommon terms that participants used to shop for a mortgage. The Board also believes that the prepayment penalty \nis a key risk factor because it is critical to the consumer's ability to sell the home or refinance the loan to obtain a \nlower rate and payments. While the other risk factors are important if contained in the loan program, the Board \nbelieves it appropriate to include those factors only as applicable to avoid information overload.\n\nRate increases. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(i) would require the creditor to indicate whether or not the interest rate on \nthe loan may increase. If the interest rate on the loan may increase, then the creditor would indicate the frequency \nwith which the interest rate may increase and the date on which the first interest rate increase may occur. Proposed \ncomment 38(d)(1)-1 would clarify that disclosing the date means that the creditor must disclose the calendar month \nand year.\n\nPayment increases. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(ii) would require the creditor to indicate whether or not the periodic \npayment on the loan may increase. If the periodic payment on the loan may increase, then the creditor would be \nrequired to indicate the date on which the first payment increase may occur. For payment option loans, the creditor \nwould be required to disclose the dates on which the full and minimum payments may increase. Proposed comment \n38(d)(1)-1 would clarify that disclosing the date means that the creditor must disclose the calendar month and year.\n\nPrepayment penalty. As currently required under TILA Section 128(a)(11), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(11), and \u00a7 \n226.18(k)(1), if the obligation includes a finance charge computed from time to time by application of a rate to the \n\n\n\nunpaid principal balance, proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(iii) would require the creditor to indicate whether or not a penalty \nwill be imposed if the obligation is prepaid in full. If the creditor may impose a prepayment penalty, the creditor \nwould disclose the circumstances under which and period in which the creditor would impose the penalty and the \namount of the maximum penalty. Because of the importance of prepayment penalties, the proposed rule would also \nrequire disclosure of prepayment penalties, if applicable, under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5). To avoid duplication, \nproposed comments 38(d)(1)(iii)-1 to -3 would cross-reference proposed comments 38(a)(5)-1 to -3 for information \nabout whether there is a prepayment penalty, and examples of charges that are or are not prepayment penalties. In \naddition, proposed comment 38(d)(1)(iii)-4 would cross-reference comment 38(a)(5)-6 to determine the maximum \nprepayment penalty. Proposed comment 38(d)(1)(iii)-5 would cross-reference comment 38(a)(5)-7 for information \nabout any differences resulting from the consumer's payment patterns and basing disclosures on the required \npayment for a negative amortization loan. Although under proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) the disclosure of the \nprepayment penalty would appear on the first page of the transaction-specific TILA disclosure only if this feature \nwere present in the loan, the disclosure would always appear on the second page in the \"Key Questions\" disclosure \nin order for the consumer to verify whether or not there is a prepayment penalty associated with the loan. 38(d)(2) \nAdditional Disclosures\nAs noted above, proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2) would require the creditor to disclose information about the following six \nterms, as applicable: (1) Interest-only payments, (2) negative amortization, (3) balloon payment, (4) demand \nfeature, (5) no-documentation or low-documentation loans, and (6) shared-equity or shared-appreciation. Proposed \ncomment 38(d)(2)-1 would clarify that \"as applicable\" means that any disclosure not relevant to a particular loan \nmay be omitted. Although consumer testing showed that some participants felt reassured by seeing all of the risk \nfactors whether the factors were a feature of the loan or not, the Board is concerned about the potential for \ninformation overload if the entire list is included.\n\nInterest-only payments. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(i) would require the creditor to disclose that periodic payments will \nbe applied only toward interest on the loan. The creditor would also disclose any limitation on the number of \nperiodic payments that will be applied only toward interest on the loan, that such payments will cover the interest \nowed each month, but none of the principal, and that making these periodic payments means the loan amount will \nstay the same and the consumer will be not have paid any of the loan amount. For payment option loans, the \ncreditor would disclose that the loan gives the consumer the choice to make periodic payments that cover the \ninterest owed each month, but none of the principal, and that making these periodic payments means the loan \namount will stay the same and the consumer will not have paid any of the loan amount.\n\nNegative amortization. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(ii) would require the creditor to disclose that the loan balance may \nincrease even if the consumer makes the periodic payments. In addition, the creditor would be required to disclose \nthat the minimum payment covers only a part of the interest the consumer owes each period and none of the \nprincipal, that the unpaid interest will be added to the consumer's loan amount, and that over time this will increase \nthe total amount the consumer is borrowing and cause the consumer to lose equity in the home.\n\nBalloon payment. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iii) would require the creditor to disclose that the consumer will owe a \nballoon payment, along with a statement of the amount that will be due and the date on which it will be due. \nProposed comment 38(d)(2)(iii)-1 would clarify that the creditor must make this disclosure if the loan program \nincludes a payment schedule with regular periodic payments that when aggregated do not fully amortize the \noutstanding principal balance.\n\nDemand feature. As currently required under \u00a7 226.18(i), proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iv) would require the creditor to \ndisclose a statement that the creditor may demand full repayment of the loan, along with a statement of the timing \nof any advance notice the creditor is required to give the consumer before the creditor exercises such right. \nProposed comment 38(d)(2)(iv)-1 would clarify that this requirement would apply not only to transactions payable \non demand from the outset, but also to transactions that convert to a demand status after a stated period. Proposed \ncomment 38(d)(2)(iv)-2 would cross-reference comment 18(i)-2 regarding covered demand features.\n\nNo-documentation or low-documentation loans. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(v) would require the creditor to disclose \nthat the consumer's loan will have a higher rate or fees because the consumer did not document employment, \n\n\n\nincome, or other assets. In addition, the creditor would disclose that if the consumer provides more documentation, \nthe consumer could decrease the interest rate or fees.\n\nShared-equity or shared-appreciation. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(vi) would require the creditor to disclose a \nstatement that any future equity or appreciation in the real property or dwelling that secures the loan must be \nshared, along with a statement of the events that may trigger such obligation.\n\n38(d)(3) Format Requirements\n\nBased on consumer testing, as discussed more fully in \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(2) and 226.37, proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(3) would \nrequire the creditor to disclose the \"Key Questions about Risk\" using a special format. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(3)(i) \nwould require the creditor to provide the disclosures required in \u00a7 226.38(d)(1) and (d)(2), as applicable, in the form \nof a table with headings, content and format substantially similar to Model Forms H--19(A), H--19(B), or H--19(C) in \nAppendix H. Only the information required or permitted by \u00a7 226.38(d)(1) and (2) would be permitted in this table. In \naddition, under \u00a7 226.38(d)(3)(ii), the disclosures would be required to be grouped together and presented in the \nformat of a question and answer in a manner substantially similar to Model Form H--19(A), H--19(B), or H--19(C) in \nAppendix H. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(3)(iii) would further require the creditor to disclose each affirmative answer in \nbold text and in all capitalized letters, but negative answers would be disclosed in nonbold text. Finally, proposed \n226.38(d)(3)(iv) would require the creditor to make the disclosures, as applicable, in the following order: rate \nincreases under \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(i), payment increases under \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(ii), interest-only payments under \u00a7 \n226.38(d)(2)(i), negative amortization under \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(ii), balloon payments under \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iii), \nprepayment penalties under \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(iiii), demand feature under \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iv), no-documentation or low-\ndocumentation loans under \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(v), and shared-equity or shared-appreciation under \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(vi). \nThis order would ensure that consumers receive critical information about their payments first.\n\n38(e) Information About Payments\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(e) would require disclosure of additional information about interest rates and payments, \nincluding disclosure of the amount financed, the \"interest and settlement charges,\" (currently the \"finance charge\"), \nthe total of payments, and the number of payments. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(e) would also require disclosure of whether \nor not an escrow account for taxes and insurance is required, a disclosure about private mortgage insurance, if \napplicable, and information about limitations on rate and payment changes. In the consumer testing conducted by \nthe Board, consumers did not find certain terms that are prominently disclosed on the current transaction-specific \nTILA form to be useful. Specifically, the amount financed, the total of payments, and the finance charge were less \nuseful to consumers than other information such as information about the loan amount, interest rates, and monthly \npayments. The Board believes that it would enhance consumers' overall understanding of the disclosures if these \nitems were placed less prominently on the form. In addition, by placing these terms in the context of a larger \nexplanatory statement, some consumers may better be able to understand these terms. At the same time, \nconsumer testing conducted for the Board has shown that there is other information about the loan terms that \nconsumers find beneficial that is not currently disclosed on the transaction-specific form. Specifically, the Board \nbelieves that consumers would find it beneficial to have explanations of how the interest rate or payment amounts \ncan change and whether there are limits on those changes, and notification of whether an escrow account or \nprivate mortgage insurance are required.\n\n38(e)(1) and (2) Rate Calculation; Rate and Payment Change Limits\n\nProposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(e)(1) and 226.38(e)(2) would require disclosures of how the consumer's variable interest rate \nis calculated, of any limitations on adjustments to the interest rate, and of any limitations on payment adjustments in \nnegatively amortizing loans. The requirements under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(e)(1) and 226.38(e)(2) to provide \ndisclosures of how the rate is calculated and any limitations on adjustments to the interest rate are similar to the \nrequirements of current \u00a7\u00a7 226.18(f)(1)(i) and 226.18(f)(1)(ii) for transactions not secured by the consumer's \nprincipal dwelling or secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term of one year or less. Currently, for \n\n\n\ntransactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year, \u00a7 226.19(b)(2) \nrequires information about the variable interest rate to be disclosed at the time an application form is provided to the \nconsumer, or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. However, under current \u00a7 \n226.18(f)(2), in the transaction-specific disclosures provided before consummation, only a statement that the \ntransaction contains a variable-rate feature, and a statement that variable-rate disclosures have been provided \nearlier, are required. The Board believes that providing information about how the interest rate is calculated and \nabout limitations on interest rate adjustments along with other transaction-specific disclosures would provide \nconsumers with meaningful information about their particular interest rate in the context of the entire transaction \nbeing disclosed. For adjustable-rate mortgages, proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(1) would require a statement of how the \ninterest rate is calculated. In addition, if the interest rate at consummation is not based on the index and margin that \nwill be used to make later interest rate adjustments, the statement would be required to include the time period \nwhen the initial interest rate expires.\n\nProposed comment 38(e)(1)-1 is similar to current comment 18(f)(1)(i)-1 for credit not secured by the consumer's \nprincipal dwelling, or secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term of one year or less. The proposed \ncomment would clarify that if the interest rate is calculated based on the addition of a margin to an index the \nstatement would have to identify the index to which the rate is tied and the margin that will be added to the index, as \nwell as any conditions or events on which the increase is contingent. When no specific index is used, the factors \nused to determine whether to increase the rate would be required to be disclosed. When the increase in the rate is \ndiscretionary, the fact that any increase is within the creditor's discretion would be required to be disclosed. When \nthe index is internal (for example, the creditor's prime rate), the creditor would be permitted to comply with the \ndisclosure requirement by providing either a brief description of that index or a statement that any increase is in the \ndiscretion of the creditor. An external index, however, would be required to be identified.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(2) would require a statement of any limitations on the increase in the interest rate in a \nvariable-rate transaction, and, for negatively amortizing loans, a statement of any limitations on the increase in the \nminimum payment amount and the circumstances under which the minimum payment required may recast to a fully \namortizing payment. Proposed comment 38(e)(2)-1, covering variable-rate transactions, would be similar to current \ncomment 18(f)(1)(ii)-1 and would clarify that the disclosure of limitations on adjustments to the interest rate must \nprovide any maximum imposed on the amount of an increase in the rate at any time, as well as any maximum on \nthe total increase over the transaction's term to maturity.\n\nProposed comment 38(e)(2)-2, covering negatively amortizing loans, would clarify that any limit imposed on the \nchange of a minimum payment amount, whether or not the change follows an adjustment to the interest rate, would \nbe required to be disclosed. In addition, any conditions to the limitation on payment increases would also be \nrequired to be disclosed. For example, some loan programs provide that the minimum payment will not increase by \nmore than a certain percentage, regardless of the corresponding increase in the interest rate. However, there may \nbe exceptions to the limitation on the payment increase, such as if the consumer's principal balance reaches a \ncertain threshold, or if the legal obligation sets out a scheduled time when payment increases will not be limited.\n\n38(e)(3) Escrow\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(3) would require, if applicable, a statement substantially similar to the following: \"An escrow \naccount is required for property taxes and insurance (such as homeowner's insurance). Your escrow payment is an \nestimate and can change at any time. See your Good Faith Estimate or HUD--1 form for more details.\" If no escrow \nis required, the creditor would be required to state that fact and that the consumer must pay property taxes and \ninsurance directly.\n\n38(e)(4) Mortgage Insurance\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(4) would require, if applicable, a statement substantially similar to the following: \"Private \nMortgage Insurance (PMI) is required for this loan. It is included in your escrow.\" If other mortgage insurance is \n\n\n\nrequired, such as insurance or guaranty obtained from a government agency, the creditor would be required to omit \nthe word \"private\" from the description.\n\n38(e)(5) Total Payments\n\n38(e)(5)(i) Total Payments\n\nSection 226.18(h), which implements TILA Section 128(a)(5) and (8), requires creditors to disclose the total of \npayments, using that term, together with a descriptive statement that the disclosed amount reflects the sum of all \nscheduled payments disclosed under \u00a7 226.18(g). 85 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(5), (a)(8). Current comment 18(h)-1 allows \ncreditors to revise the total of payments descriptive statement for variable rate transactions to convey that the \ndisclosed amount is based on the annual percentage rate and may change. In addition, current comments 18(h)-3 \nand --4 permit creditors to omit the total of payments disclosure in certain single-payment transactions and for \ndemand obligations that have no alternate maturity date.\n\nConsumer testing conducted by the Board showed that participants did not find the total of payments to be helpful \nin evaluating a loan offer. Most participants understood that the total of payments generally represented the sum of \nscheduled payments and charges, including interest; several suggested that an explanation of how the total of \npayments is calculated would facilitate comprehension of the term. Some participants expressed interest in knowing \nthe total of payments required to pay off the loan obligation, but regarded this information as marginally useful to \ntheir shopping and decision-making process. On the other hand, some participants commented that information \nabout the total of payments was unnecessary and therefore, could be removed from the form entirely.\n\nAs part of consumer testing, the Board shortened the term \"total of payments\" to \"total payments\" because it is a \nmore direct and simple term to communicate to consumers what the dollar amount represented. In addition, an \nexplanation of the assumptions underlying the total payments calculation was added with an explicit reference to \nwhether the amount included escrowed amounts. The total payment amount was disclosed with a statement \nexplaining that a portion of it goes towards interest and settlement charges. This approach enhanced consumer \ncomprehension of the total payments and, as discussed more fully below, the interest and settlement charges \ndisclosure.\n\nThe Board proposes to rename \"total of payments\" as \"total payments,\" and require that it be disclosed with a \ndescriptive statement, for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The Board proposes to make this \nadjustment pursuant to its exception authority under TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Section 105(a) \nauthorizes the Board to make exceptions and adjustments to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which \ninclude facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of \ncredit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The Board believes that proposing the exception is appropriate. Consumer \ntesting indicates that \"total payments\" is more understandable to consumers than \"total of payments.\"\n\n85 Section 128(a)(5) of TILA states that the total of payments should be disclosed as the sum of the amount financed and finance \ncharge. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(5). Since 1969, the Board has required that the total of payments equal the sum of payments \ndisclosed in the payment schedule under TILA Section 128(a)(6) and \u00a7 226.18(g), which can include amounts beyond the \namount financed and the finance charge. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(6). Thus, if a creditor includes escrowed taxes and insurance in its \ndisclosure of scheduled payments under \u00a7 226.18(g), it must also include those amounts in the total of payments disclosed \nunder \u00a7 226.18(h). 34 FR 02002; Feb. 11, 1969.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Board proposes to add new \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i), which would implement TILA Sections 128(a)(5), 128(a)(6), in \npart, and 128(a)(8) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(8). \nProposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) would require creditors to disclose for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling, the number and total amount of payments that the consumer would make over the full term of the loan. \nThe Board proposes that this disclosure be made together with a brief statement that the amount is calculated \nassuming market rates will not change, and that the consumer will make all payments as scheduled for the full term \nof the loan. The Board believes that although the total payments disclosure is not critical to the shopping or \ndecision-making process for many consumers, it provides information about the total cost of the loan that provides \ncontext for, and increases understanding of, other required disclosures, such as interest and settlement charges \n(formerly finance charge) and amount financed.\n\nProposed comments 38(e)(5)(i)-1 through --3 would be added to provide guidance to creditors on how to calculate \nand disclose the total payments amount and the number of payments. As discussed more fully under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(c), the Board is proposing to require creditors to provide interest rate and monthly payment disclosures in a \ntabular format for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. As a result, creditors would not be subject to \nthe disclosure requirements for payment schedules under current \u00a7 226.18(g). However, proposed comment \n38(e)(5)(i)-1 would clarify that creditors should continue to follow the rules in \u00a7 226.18(g) and associated \ncommentary, and comments 17(c)(1)-8 and -10 for adjustable rate transactions, to calculate the total payments for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. New comment 38(e)(5)(i)-2 would cross-reference to comment \n18(g)-3, which the Board proposes to revise to require creditors to disclose the total number of payments for all \npayment levels as a single figure for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Proposed comment \n38(e)(5)(i)-3 would provide guidance regarding demand obligations. In technical revisions, the text from current \nfootnote 44 would be moved to the regulation text in \u00a7 226.18(h); however, this text is not included in proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(e)(5)(ii) because it is not applicable to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\nAs discussed more fully under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii) for interest and settlement charges (formerly \"finance \ncharge\"), creditors would be required to group the total payments disclosure together with the interest and \nsettlement charges and amount financed disclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii) and (iii), respectively.\n\n38(e)(5)(ii) Finance Charge: Interest and Charges\n\nSection 226.18(d), which implements TILA Sections 128(a)(3) and (a)(8), requires creditors to disclose the \"finance \ncharge,\" using that term, and a brief description such as \"the dollar amount the credit will cost you.\" 15 U.S.C. \n1638(a)(3), (a)(8). Current comment 18(d)-1 allows creditors to modify this description for variable rate transactions \nwith a phrase that the disclosed amount is subject to change. In addition, \u00a7 226.17(a)(2), which implements TILA \nSection 122(a), requires creditors to disclose the finance charge, and the annual percentage rate, more \nconspicuously than any other required disclosure, except the creditor's identity. 15 U.S.C. 1633(a). The rules \naddressing which charges must be included in the finance charge are set forth under TILA Section 106 and \u00a7 226.4, \nand are discussed more fully under \u00a7 226.4 of this proposal. 15 U.S.C. 1605.\n\nConsumer testing conducted by the Board indicated that many participants could not correctly explain the term \n\"finance charge.\" 86 Most participants thought that the finance charge represented the amount of interest the \nborrower would pay over the life of the loan, but did not realize that it also included fees until directed to read a \nstatement that explained fees were included. Consumer testing showed that comprehension of the finance charge \nimproved when it was renamed to reflect the costs it actually represented--the interest and settlement charges paid \n\n86 See also Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosures (stating that a number of respondents misinterpreted the finance \ncharge).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nover the life of the loan. However, even when participants understood what the finance charge signified they tended \nto disregard it, often because it was such a large dollar amount. Several participants commented that it is helpful to \nknow the total amount of interest and fees that would be paid, but that they could not otherwise purchase a home, \nor refinance an existing obligation, in cash and therefore, already understood they would pay a significant amount in \ninterest and fees when repaying the loan. Still, participants expressed an interest in knowing the total amount of \ninterest and other charges they would pay over the full term of the loan.\n\nThe Board proposes to exercise its authority under TILA Section 105(a) to rename \"finance charge\" as \"interest and \nsettlement charges,\" except it from the requirement under TILA Section 122(a) that it be disclosed more \nconspicuously, and require that it be disclosed with a descriptive statement. 15 U.S.C. 1632(a); 1604(a), (f). Section \n105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions or adjustments to TILA for any class of transactions to effectuate \nthe statute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers \navoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). In this case, the Board believes an exception from \nTILA's requirements are necessary to effectuate the Act's purposes for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling. Although some consumers expressed interest in the finance charge when evaluating a loan offer, \nconsumer testing showed that for most consumers it is not as useful in the shopping or decision-making process as \nother terms, and therefore, should be de-emphasized relative to other disclosed terms. Consumer testing also \nshowed that participants had a better understanding of the finance charge when it was disclosed as a portion of the \ntotal payments amount, accompanied by a statement that explained the finance charge amount plus the amount \nfinanced is used to calculate the APR. Thus, based on consumer testing, the Board believes that consumers will \nfind the finance charge disclosure more meaningful when described in a manner consistent with consumers' \ngeneral understanding, and disclosed in context with other information that relate to loan payments, such as the \ntotal payments.\n\nThe Board proposes to add new \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii), which would implement TILA Section 128(a)(3) and (8) for \nclosed-end mortgage loans covered by \u00a7 226.38. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(3), (8). Section 226.38(e)(5)(ii) would require \ncreditors to disclose the \"interest and settlement charges,\" using that term, together with a brief statement that the \ndisclosed amount represents part of the total payments amount disclosed. Creditors would also be required to \ndisclose the \"interest and settlement charges\" grouped together with the \"total payments\" and \"amount financed\" \ndisclosures under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) and (iii), respectively, under the subheading \"Total Payments,\" using \nthat term. Based on consumer testing, the Board believes this approach is appropriate to help serve TILA's purpose \nof assuring a meaningful disclosure of credit terms. Consumer testing suggests that providing the disclosure of \n\"interest and settlement charges\" in context of the total payments improves consumers' ability to understand that \nthis disclosure represents the cost (i.e., interest and fees) of borrowing the loan amount.\n\nThe Board also proposes comment 38(e)(5)(ii)-1 to provide guidance on how creditors must calculate and disclose \nthe interest and settlement charges. However, the proposed rule would not allow creditors to modify the description \nthat accompanies the disclosure for variable-rate transactions. The Board proposes this restriction under TILA \nSection 105(a) to help serve TILA's purpose of meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able \nto compare more readily the various credit terms available, and avoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. \n1601(a). Consumer testing showed that the simple disclosure aided consumer understanding. The Board believes \nthat adding language that states the disclosed amount is subject to change could dilute the significance of the \ndisclosure.\n\n38(e)(5)(iii) Amount Financed\n\nDisclosure of amount financed. Section 226.18(b), which implements TILA Section 128(a)(2)(A) and (a)(8), requires \ncreditors to disclose the amount financed, using that term, together with a brief description that it represents the \namount of credit of which the consumer has actual use. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(2)(A), (a)(8). Section 226.18(b) \ndelineates how creditors should calculate the amount financed so that it reflects the net amount of credit being \nextended.\n\n\n\nIn consumer testing conducted for the Board, virtually no participant understood the disclosure of the amount \nfinanced. 87 The Board tested several versions of the amount financed disclosure, with alternative formatting and \ndescriptions, to explain briefly that it represents the amount of credit of which the consumer has actual use to \npurchase a home or refinance an existing loan. However, these changes made no difference in participants' \nunderstanding of the term. In addition, consumer testing showed that the amount financed disclosure actually \ndetracted from consumers' understanding of other disclosures. Many consumers mistook the amount financed for \nthe loan amount. Some of these consumers were confused, however, because the amount financed was slightly \nlower than the amount borrowed in the hypothetical loan offer. Consumers offered various explanations regarding \nthe difference in the disclosed amounts, including that the amount financed was the cost of purchasing a home less \na down payment. Other participants stated that the amount financed represented escrowed amounts. Sample \ndisclosures were used to try to explain that the difference between the loan amount and amount financed is \nattributable to prepaid finance charges, but this explanation did not appear to improve consumer comprehension. \nConsumer testing also indicated that participants would not consider the amount financed when shopping for a \nmortgage or evaluating competing loan offers.\n\nFor these reasons, the Board proposes to add new \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(iii), which would implement TILA Section \n128(a)(2)(A) and (a)(8) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(2)(A), (a)(8). \nSection 226.38(e)(5)(iii) would require creditors to disclose the amount financed with a brief statement that the \namount financed, plus the interest and settlement charges, is the amount used to calculate the annual percentage \nrate. As noted above, creditors would be required to disclose the amount financed grouped together with the total \npayments and interest and settlement charges required under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) and (ii).\n\nThe Board proposes this approach pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Section \n105(a) authorizes the Board to prescribe regulations to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating \nconsumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. \n1601(a), 1604(a). Based on consumer testing, the Board believes this proposal is appropriate to help serve TILA's \npurpose of assuring a meaningful disclosure of credit terms. The Board believes that requiring creditors to disclose \nthe amount financed in the loan summary with other key loan terms would add unnecessary complexity and result \nin \"information overload.\" Consumer testing showed that when the amount financed was disclosed with the total \npayments and interest and settlement charges, that consumer comprehension of the term improved slightly, and \nconfusion over other key loan terms, such as the loan amount, was eliminated. The Board believes that disclosing \nthe amount financed as one component in the APR calculation provided consumers with a better understanding of \nits significance to the loan transaction. The Board also proposes new comment 38(e)(5)(iii)-3 to provide guidance \nregarding disclosure of the \"amount financed.\"\n\nCalculation of amount financed. The Board proposes to simplify the calculation of the amount financed for \ntransactions subject to the disclosure requirements of proposed \u00a7 226.38, pursuant to the Board's authority under \nTILA Section 105(a). The Board believes that the proposed simplification would improve understanding of the rules \nand facilitate compliance with Regulation Z. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(iii), for a transaction secured by real \nproperty or a consumer's dwelling, the creditor would determine the amount financed by subtracting all prepaid \nfinance charges from the loan amount as defined in proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(1), discussed above. Under existing \u00a7 \n226.18(b) and its staff commentary, creditors may elect from among multiple alternatives in calculating the amount \nfinanced. All of the permissible methods yield the same mathematical result.\n\n87 See also Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosures at 35 (finding that most respondents in consumer testing did not \nunderstand the term \"amount financed,\" and confused it for the loan amount, and discussing the risks of falling subject to \npredatory lending practices as a result of this confusion).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Board has received input from bank examiners and others that providing multiple approaches to calculation of \nthe amount financed creates unnecessary complication. Examiners also indicate that, of the permissible \napproaches, mortgage lenders generally use the one that is simplest and most straightforward. The Board is now \nproposing to require that approach and to eliminate the alternatives. The Board also is proposing to make a \nconforming amendment to the staff commentary under \u00a7 226.18(b) to reflect the fact that it would not apply to \nmortgages.\n\nTILA provides that the amount financed is calculated as follows:\n\n(1) Take the principal amount of the loan (or cash price less downpayment);\n\n(2) Add any charges that are not part of the finance charge or of the principal amount and that are financed by the \nconsumer; and\n\n(3) Subtract any prepaid finance charge.\n\nTILA Section 128(a)(2)(A), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(2)(A). Regulation Z provides a substantially identical calculation. See \n\u00a7 226.18(b). Neither the statute nor Regulation Z defines \"principal amount of the loan.\" As a result, more than one \nunderstanding of that term is possible, and Regulation Z seeks to address several of those understandings rather \nthan to define principal amount definitively.\n\nCurrent Regulation Z permits non-finance charges and prepaid finance charges that are financed to be included in \nthe principal loan amount under step (1) or not, at the creditor's option. The creditor then must add in under step (2) \nany financed non-finance charges that were not included under step (1). See comment 18(b)(2)-1. Similarly, the \ncreditor must subtract under step (3) any financed prepaid finance charges only if they were included under step \n(1). See comment 18(b)(3)-1. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(iii) effectively would define \"principal loan amount\" as the \nloan amount, as that is defined in proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)(1), which would mean the principal amount the consumer \nwill borrow reflected in the loan contract. Under that definition, all amounts that are financed necessarily would be \nincluded in step (1), whether they are finance charges or not. Consequently, no amount ever would be added under \nstep (2). The new provision therefore would streamline the calculation to eliminate that step. Similarly, the current \ncommentary providing that financed prepaid finance charges should be subtracted in step (3) only if they were \nincluded in step (1) would be unnecessary, as such finance charges always would be included in step (1). Proposed \n\u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(iii) would provide definitively that the amount financed is determined simply by subtracting the \nprepaid finance charge from the loan amount.\n\nThe Board also is proposing comment 38(e)(5)(iii)-2 to clarify how to treat creditor or third-party premiums and buy-\ndowns for purposes of the amount financed calculation. This proposed comment is based on existing comment \n18(b)-2, which relates to rebates and loan premiums. The discussion in comment 18(b)-2 was primarily intended to \naddress situations that are more common in non-mortgage transactions, especially credit sales, such as automobile \nfinancing. It provides that creditor-paid premiums and seller- or manufacturer-paid rebates may be reflected in the \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.18 or not, at the creditor's option. Although such premiums and rebates are less likely to \nexist in mortgage transactions precisely as they are described in comment 18(b)-2, analogous situations can apply \nto mortgage financing. For example, real estate developers may offer to pay some or all closing costs or to buy \ndown the consumer's interest rate, and creditors may agree to pay certain closing costs in return for a particular \ninterest rate. Rather than permit any treatment at the creditor's option, however, proposed comment 38(e)(5)(iii)-2 \nwould reflect the Board's belief that such situations are analogous to buydowns. Like buydowns, such premiums \nand rebates may or may not be funded by the creditor and reduce costs otherwise borne by the consumer. \nAccordingly, their impact on the amount financed, like that of buydowns, properly depends on whether they are part \nof the legal obligation. See comments 17(c)(1)-1 through -5. Proposed comment 38(e)(5)(iii)-2 would clarify that the \ndisclosures, including the amount financed, must reflect loan premiums and rebates regardless of their source, but \nonly if they are part of the terms of the legal obligation between the creditor and the consumer. As noted above, the \nBoard also is proposing similar revisions to existing comment 18(b)-2.\n\n\n\n38(f) Additional Disclosures\n\n38(f)(1) No Obligation Statement\n\nThe MDIA amended Section 128(b)(2) of TILA to require creditors to disclose, in conspicuous type size and format, \nthat receiving and signing a TILA disclosure does not obligate a consumer to accept the loan (\"the MDIA \nstatement\"). 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2). The MDIA sets forth the following language for creditors to use in making this \ndisclosure: \"You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures \nor signed a loan application.\" 88 The Board proposes to modify this statutory language to facilitate consumers' use \nand understanding of the MDIA statement pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a) to make adjustments \nthat are necessary to effectuate the purposes of TILA. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). Based on consumer testing, the Board \nbelieves that using plain language principles to revise the statutory language improves consumers' ability to \nunderstand the disclosure and would help serve TILA's purpose to provide meaningful disclosure of credit terms.\n\nAs part of consumer testing, the Board included the MDIA statement on the front page of the TILA, modified to \nreplace legalistic phrasing with more common word usage. On the second page, the Board included a signature line \nand date, as most creditors require the consumer to sign the disclosure form to establish compliance with TILA. \nMost participants did not notice the MDIA statement, but indicated that they understood they were under no \nobligation to accept the loan; participants who did notice the text similarly understood they were under no obligation \nto accept the loan. However, upon seeing the signature line, some participants believed they would be obligated to \naccept the loan if they signed or initialized the disclosure. Based on consumer testing, the Board is concerned that \nalthough consumers may initially understand they are not obligated to accept a loan, this belief may be altered by \ncreditors' practice of requiring consumers to sign or initial receipt of the disclosures. This may further discourage \nnegotiation and shopping among loan products and lenders.\n\nTo implement the new disclosure required by the MDIA, the Board proposes to add new \u00a7 226.38(f)(1) for all \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(1) would require a statement that a \nconsumer is not obligated to accept the loan because he or she has signed the disclosure. In addition, the Board \nproposes that if a creditor provides space for the consumer to sign or initial the TILA disclosures, then the creditor \nmust place the statement in close proximity to the space provided for the consumer's signature or initials. The \nstatement must also specify that a signature only confirms receipt of the disclosure statement.\n\nThe Board proposes this approach pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a) to effectuate the statute's \npurposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the \nuninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The Board believes that this proposal is necessary to \nencourage consumers to shop among available credit alternatives. The Board tested the disclosure as proposed \nunder \u00a7 226.38(f)(1). Most participants understood they were not obligated to accept the loan and could refuse to \naccept the loan offer even after signing. As a result, the Board believes the disclosure proposed by new \u00a7 \n226.38(f)(1) is necessary to ensure that consumers are not discouraged from shopping or negotiating with the \nlender.\n\n38(f)(2) Security Interest\n\nTILA Section 128(a)(9), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(9), and \u00a7 226.18(m) require the creditor to disclose whether it has a \nsecurity interest in the property securing the transaction. During consumer testing of the current TILA disclosure, \nparticipants were shown the following language: \"Security: You are giving a security interest in the real property, \nand fixtures and rents if indicated in the rider mortgage.\" Very few participants understood the current language \nregarding a security interest. The Board is concerned that consumers might not understand that the creditor can \ntake the consumer's home if the consumer defaults on the loan agreement. To clarify the significance of the security \ninterest disclosure to consumers, the Board proposes \u00a7 226.38(f)(2) to require the creditor to state that the \n\n\n\nconsumer could lose the home if the consumer is unable to make the payments on the loan. This would provide a \nclearer disclosure regarding the effect of the lender taking a security interest in the home.\n\n38(f)(3) No Guarantee to Refinance Statement\n\nThe MDIA also amended Section 128(b)(2) of TILA to require creditors to disclose for variable rate transactions, in \nconspicuous type size and format, that there is no guarantee that the consumer will be able to refinance the \ntransaction to lower the interest rate or monthly payments (\"MDIA refinancing warning\"). 89 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(2). \nTo implement the disclosure required by the MDIA, the Board proposes to add \u00a7 226.38(f)(3) to require that \ncreditors disclose that there is no guarantee that the consumer will be able to refinance the loan to obtain a lower \ninterest rate and payment. The Board believes that including such a statement on the TILA disclosure form will alert \nconsumers to consider the impact of future rate adjustments and increased monthly payments\n\nAlthough the MDIA requires this refinancing warning only for variable rate transactions secured by a dwelling, the \nBoard proposes to expand the scope of the requirement to also include fixed-rate transactions secured by a \ndwelling, as well as transactions secured by real property without a dwelling. The Board proposes this approach \npursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a) to effectuate the statute's purposes, which include facilitating \nconsumers' ability to compare credit terms and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. \n1601(a), 1604(a). The Board is concerned that some consumers may accept loan terms that could present \nrefinancing concerns similar to variable rate transactions, such as a three-year fixed-rate mortgage with a balloon \npayment. Based on consumer testing, the Board believes all consumers, regardless of transaction-type, would \nbenefit from a statement that encourages consideration of future possible market rate increases.\n\n38(f)(4) Tax Deductibility\n\nThe Board is also proposing changes to the closed-end disclosures to implement provisions of the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (the \"Bankruptcy Act\") which requires disclosure of the tax \nimplications for home-secured credit that may exceed the dwelling's fair market value. See Public Law 109-8, 119 \nStat. 23. The Bankruptcy Act primarily amended the federal bankruptcy code, but also contained several provisions \namending TILA. Section 1302 of the Bankruptcy Act amendments requires that advertisements and applications for \ncredit (either open-end or closed-end) that may exceed the fair market value of the dwelling include a statement \nthat the interest on the portion of the credit extension that exceeds the fair market value is not tax-deductible and a \nstatement that the consumer should consult a tax advisor for further information on tax deductibility.\n\nThe Board stated its intent to implement the Bankruptcy Act amendments in an ANPR published in October 2005 as \npart of the Board's ongoing review of Regulation Z (October 2005 ANPR). 70 FR 60235; Oct. 17, 2005. The Board \nreceived approximately 50 comment letters: forty-five letters were submitted by financial institutions and their trade \ngroups, and five letters were submitted by consumer groups. In general, creditors asked for flexibility in providing \nthe disclosure regarding the tax implications for home-secured credit that may exceed the dwelling's fair market \nvalue, either by permitting the notice to be provided to all mortgage applicants, or to be provided later in the \napproval process after creditors have determined whether the disclosure is triggered. Creditor commenters asked \nfor guidance on loan-to-value calculations and safe harbors for how creditors should determine property values. \nConsumer advocates favored triggering the disclosure when negative amortization could occur. A number of \n\n89 Specifically, the MDIA requires that the Board use consumer testing to develop disclosures for variable rate transactions, \nincluding the fact that \"there is no guarantee that the borrower will be able to refinance to a lower amount.\" Public Law 109-8, \n119 Stat. 23, \u00a7 2502(a)(6).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ncommenters stated that in order for the disclosure to be effective and useful to the borrower, it should be given \nwhen the new extension of credit, combined with existing credit secured by the dwelling (if any), may exceed the \nfair market value of the dwelling. A few industry comments took the opposite view that the disclosure should be \nlimited only to when a new extension of credit itself exceeds fair market value, citing the difficulty in determining \nhow much debt is already secured by the dwelling at the time of application.\n\nThe Board implemented section 1302 with regard to advertisements in its 2008 HOEPA Final Rule. See 73 FR \n44522, 44600; July 30, 2008. In the supplementary information to that rule, the Board stated that it intends to \nimplement the application disclosure portion of the Bankruptcy Act during its forthcoming review of closed-end and \nHELOC disclosures under TILA. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(4) would implement provisions of the Bankruptcy Act by \nrequiring creditors to include the disclosure of the tax implications for a loan secured by a dwelling, if extension of \ncredit may, by its terms, exceed the fair market value of the dwelling. The text of the proposed disclosure is based \non the Board's consumer testing of model HELOC disclosure forms. The disclosure would be segregated and \nlocated directly below the table.\n\nThe Board recognizes that creditors may not be able to determine whether the amount of credit extended exceeds \nthe fair market value of the dwelling, especially three days after application when they are required to provide an \nearly transaction-specific disclosures. The creditor may not be able to verify the value on the property until later in \nthe loan underwriting process. The Board has considered whether the disclosure should be provided later in the \napproval process after the creditor has determined that the disclosure is triggered, for instance, after receiving the \nappraisal report or completing the underwriting process. However, such late timing of the disclosure would not \nsatisfy the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act which requires that the disclosures be provided at the time of \napplication. See 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(15).\n\nThe Board also considered whether the disclosure should be provided to all mortgage applicants, regardless of \nwhether the amount of credit extended exceeds the fair market value of the dwelling. To address the situations in \nwhich the creditor is not certain whether the credit extended may exceed the fair market value of the dwelling, \ncomment 38(f)(4)-2 permits the disclosure to be provided to all mortgage applicants at creditors' discretion and \nprovides model language.\n\nThe Board recognizes that the scope of the proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(4) is limited to dwellings whereas proposed \u00a7 \n226.38 would apply to real property and dwellings. While the Bankruptcy Act amendment specifically references \n\"consumer's dwelling,\" the Board believes that it would be unnecessarily burdensome to require creditors to create \nseparate disclosures for the transactions secured by real property and those secured by a dwelling solely for the \npurposes of the tax implications disclosure. For that reason, a creditor would be permitted, but not required, to \nprovide the disclosures about the tax implications in connection with transactions secured by both real property and \ndwellings.\n\n38(f)(5) Additional Information and Web Site\n\nConsumer testing showed that many participants educated themselves about the mortgage process through \ninformal networking with family, friends, and colleagues, while others relied on the Internet for information. To \nimprove consumers' ability to make informed decisions about credit, the Board proposes \u00a7 226.38(f)(5) to require \nthe creditor to disclose that if the consumer does not understand any of the disclosures, then the consumer should \nask questions. The creditor would also disclose that the consumer may obtain additional information at the Web site \nof the Federal Reserve Board and disclose a reference to that Web site. The Board will enhance its Web site to \nfurther assist consumers in shopping for a mortgage. Although it is hard to predict from the results of the consumer \ntesting how many consumers might use the Board's Web site, and recognizing that not all consumers have access \nto the Internet, the Board believes that this Web site may be helpful to some consumers as they shop for a \nmortgage. The Board seeks comment on the content for the Web site.\n\n38(f)(6) Format\n\n\n\nThe Board is proposing to specify precise formatting requirements for the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38(f)(1) \nthrough (5). Proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(6)(i) would set forth location requirements, providing that the no obligation and \nconfirmation of receipt statements must be disclosed together, the security interest and no guarantee to refinance \nstatements must be disclosed together, and the recommendation to ask questions and statement regarding the \nBoard's Web site must be disclosed together. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(f)(6)(ii) would set forth highlighting requirements, \nproviding that the no obligation and security interest statements, and the advice to ask questions, must be \ndisclosed in bold text.\n\n38(g) Identification of Originator and Creditor\n\n38(g)(1) Creditor\n\nCurrently, \u00a7 226.18(a), which implements TILA Section 128(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(1), requires the creditor to \ndisclose the identity of the creditor making the disclosure. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(g)(1) would require the same \ndisclosure. In addition, proposed comment 38(g)(1)-1 would parallel existing comment 18(a)-1 to clarify that use of \nthe creditor's name is sufficient, but the creditor may also include an address and/or telephone number. In \ntransactions with multiple creditors, any one of them may make the disclosures, but the one doing so must be \nidentified. The Board solicits comment on whether the creditor making the disclosures should be required to \ndisclose its contact information, such as its address and/or telephone number.\n\nExisting footnote 38 to \u00a7 226.17(a), which implements TILA Section 128(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(1), states that the \ncreditor's identity may be made together with or separately from the other required disclosures. The Board \nproposes to amend the substance of current footnote 38 to remove the reference to the creditor's identity disclosure \nrequired under \u00a7 226.18(a), thereby making it subject to the grouped-together and segregation requirement for all \nnon-mortgage closed-end credit. Similarly, \u00a7 226.37(a)(2) would require the disclosure of the creditor's identity to be \nsubject to the grouped-together and segregation requirement for closed-end credit transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling.\n\nThe Board proposes to make this adjustment pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a). 15 U.S.C. \n1604(a). Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions and adjustments to TILA to effectuate the \nstatute's purposes, which include facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms, and avoid the uninformed \nuse of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). The Board believes it is important to disclose the creditor's \nidentity so that consumers can more easily identify the appropriate entity. Thus, the Board believes this proposal \nwould help serve TILA's purpose to provide meaningful disclosure of credit terms.\n\n38(g)(2) Loan Originator\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act), 12 U.S.C. \n5101-5116, was enacted to create a Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry of loan originators to \nincrease uniformity, reduce fraud and regulatory burden, and enhance consumer protection. 12 U.S.C. 5102. Under \nthe SAFE Act, a \"loan originator\" is defined as \"an individual who (I) takes a residential mortgage loan application; \nand (II) offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan for compensation or gain.\" 12 U.S.C. 5102(3)(A)(i). \nEach loan originator is required to obtain a unique identifier through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System \nand Registry. 12 U.S.C. 5103(a)(2). The term \"unique identifier\" is defined as \"a number or other identifier that (i) \npermanently identifies a loan originator; (ii) is assigned by protocols established by the Nationwide Mortgage \nLicensing System and Registry and the Federal banking agencies to facilitate electronic tracking of loan originators \nand uniform identification of, and public access to, the employment history of and the publicly adjudicated \ndisciplinary and enforcement actions against loan originators; and (iii) shall not be used for purposes other than \nthose set forth under this title.\" 15 U.S.C. 5102(12)(A). The system is intended to provide consumers with easily \naccessible information to research a loan originator's history of employment and any disciplinary or enforcement \nactions against that person. 12 U.S.C. 5101(7).\n\n\n\nTo facilitate the use of the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry and promote the informed use of \ncredit, the Board proposes \u00a7 226.38(g)(2) to require the loan originator to disclose his or her unique identifier on the \nTILA disclosure, as defined by the SAFE Act. Proposed comment 38(g)(2)-1 would clarify that in transactions with \nmultiple loan originators, each loan originator's unique identifier must be listed on the disclosure. For example, in a \ntransaction where a mortgage broker meets the SAFE Act definition of a loan originator, the identifiers for the broker \nand for its employee loan originator meeting that definition would be listed on the disclosure.\n\nThe Board notes that the Board, FDIC, OCC, OTS, NCUA, and Farm Credit Administration have published a \nproposed rule to implement the SAFE Act. See 74 FR 27386; June 9, 2009. In this proposed rule, the federal \nbanking agencies have requested comment on whether there are mortgage loans for which there may be no \nmortgage loan originator. For example, the agencies query whether there are situations where a consumer applies \nfor and is offered a loan through an automated process without contact with a mortgage loan originator. See id. at \n27397. The Board solicits comments on the scope of this problem and its impact on the requirements of proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(g)(2).\n\n38(h) Credit Insurance and Debt Cancellation and Debt Suspension Coverage\n\nAs discussed more fully in \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (3), concerns have been raised that consumers do not understand the \nvoluntary nature, costs, and eligibility restrictions of credit insurance and debt cancellation and debt suspension \ncoverage. For this reason, the Board proposes \u00a7 226.38(h) to require creditors to provide certain disclosures, which \nwould be grouped together and substantially similar in headings, content and format to Model Clause H-17(C) in \nAppendix H to this part. Proposed comment 38(h)-1 would clarify that this disclosure may, at the creditor's option, \nappear apart from the other disclosures. It may appear with any other information, including the amount financed \nitemization, any information prescribed by State law, or other information. When this information is disclosed with \nthe other segregated disclosures, however, no additional explanatory material may be included.\n\nThe proposed disclosures seek to address concerns that consumers may not understand that some products are \nvoluntary and not required as a condition of receiving credit. If the product is optional, proposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(1)(i) \nwould require the creditor to disclose the term \"OPTIONAL COSTS,\" in capitalized and bold letters, along with the \nname of the program in bold letters. If the product is required, then proposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(1)(ii) would require the \ncreditor to disclose only the name of the program in bold letters. In addition, if the product is optional, proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(h)(2) would require the creditor to disclose the term \"STOP,\" in capitalized and bold letters, along with a \nstatement that the consumer does not have to buy the product to get the loan. The term \"not\" would be in bold \nletters and underlined.\n\nConcerns have also been raised that consumers may not realize that there are alternatives to the product. \nTherefore, under proposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(3), the creditor would disclose that if the consumer already has insurance, \nthen the policy or coverage may not provide the consumer with additional benefits. Under proposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(4), \nthe creditor would disclose that other types of insurance may give the consumer similar benefits and are often less \nexpensive.\n\nAs described more fully in \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (3), concerns have been raised that consumers are not aware that they \ncould incur a cost for a product that may offer no benefit if the eligibility criteria are not met at the time of enrollment. \nThat is, consumers may not be aware that if they do not meet the eligibility criteria at the time of enrollment, the \nproduct would not pay off, cancel, or suspend the credit obligation. Although the creditor typically has information \nabout the consumer's age or employment status, some creditors do not use this information to determine whether \nthe consumer meets the age or employment eligibility restrictions at the time of enrollment. Some consumers are \nlater denied benefits based on these eligibility restrictions.\n\nFor these reasons, the Board is proposing under \u00a7 226.38(h)(5)(i) to require the creditor to disclose a statement that \nbased on the creditor's review of the consumer's age and/or employment status at the time of enrollment, the \nconsumer would be eligible to receive benefits. However, if there are other eligibility restrictions, such as pre-\nexisting health conditions, the creditor would be required to make certain other disclosures. Under proposed \u00a7 \n\n\n\n226.38(h)(5)(ii), the creditor would disclose that based on the creditor's review of the consumer's age and/or \nemployment status at the time of enrollment, the consumer may be eligible to receive benefits. Under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(h)(6), the creditor would also disclose that the consumer may not be eligible to receive any benefits because \nof other eligibility restrictions.\n\nProposed comment 38(h)(5)-1 would state that if, based on the creditor's review of the consumer's age and/or \nemployment status at the time of enrollment in the product, the consumer would not qualify for the benefits of the \nproduct, then providing the disclosure under \u00a7 226.38(h)(5) would not comply with this provision. That is, if the \nconsumer does not meet the age and/or employment eligibility criteria, then the creditor cannot state that the \nconsumer may be eligible to receive benefits and cannot comply with this provision. In addition, the proposed \ncomment would clarify that if the creditor offers a bundled product (such as credit life insurance combined with \ncredit involuntary unemployment insurance) and the consumer is not eligible for all of the bundled products, then \nthe disclosure under \u00a7 226.38(h)(5) would not comply with this provision. Finally, the proposed comment would \nclarify that the disclosure would still satisfy this provision if an event subsequent to enrollment, such as the \nconsumer passing the age limit of the product, made the consumer ineligible for the product based on the product's \nage or employment eligibility restrictions.\n\nProposed comment 38(h)(5)-2 would clarify that the disclosure under \u00a7 226.38(h)(5) would be deemed to comply \nwith this provision if the creditor used reasonably reliable evidence to determine whether the consumer met the age \nor employment eligibility criteria of the product. Reasonably reliable evidence of a consumer's age would include \nusing the date of birth on the consumer's credit application, on the driver's license or other government-issued \nidentification, or on the credit report. Reasonably reliable evidence of a consumer's employment status would \ninclude a consumer's statement on a credit application form, an Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, \npayroll receipts, or other written evidence such as a letter or e-mail from the consumer or the consumer's employer.\n\nFinally, the disclosure would contain the debt suspension coverage disclosure, a Web site reference, cost \ninformation, and a space for the consumer's signature and the date. To ensure consistency with the debt \nsuspension coverage provisions of the December 2008 Open-End Final Rule, proposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(7) would \nrequire the creditor to disclose, as applicable, a statement that the obligation to pay loan principal and interest is \nonly suspended, and that interest will continue to accrue during the period of suspension. To provide more \ninformation to consumers, proposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(8) would require the creditor to disclose a statement that the \nconsumer may obtain additional information about credit insurance or debt suspension or debt cancellation \ncoverage at the Web site of the Federal Reserve Board, and a reference to that Web site. If the product is optional, \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(9)(i) would require the creditor to disclose a statement of the consumer's request to purchase \nor enroll in the optional product and a statement of the cost of the product expressed as a dollar amount per month \nor per year, as applicable, together with the loan amount and the term of the product in years. This disclosure \nparallels \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (3), which requires cost disclosures in order to exclude from the finance charge the \ncredit insurance premium or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage charge. If the product is required, \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(9)(ii) would require the creditor to disclose that fact, along with a statement of the cost of the \nproduct expressed as a dollar amount per month or per year, as applicable, together with the loan amount and the \nterm of the product in years. The cost, month or year, loan amount, and term of the product would be underlined. \nThe provisions regarding required products would be applicable to the extent Regulation Y, 12 CFR part 225, or \nState or other law would not prohibit requiring the product. Finally, proposed \u00a7 226.38(h)(10) would require the \ncreditor to provide a designation for the signature of the consumer and the date of the signing.\n\nThe Board proposes to require this disclosure using its authority under TILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). \nBecause proposed \u00a7 226.4(g) would treat a premium or charge for credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension as a finance charge for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, the \ncreditor would not be required to provide the disclosure under \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (3) to exclude the premium or \ncharge from the finance charge. The Board believes, however, that the consumer would still benefit from a \ndisclosure of the voluntary nature, costs, and eligibility restrictions of credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension coverage, and thus the proposal would require a substantially similar disclosure.\n\n\n\nTILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), authorizes the Board to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of \nthe act. TILA's purpose includes promoting \"the informed use of credit,\" which \"results from an awareness of the \ncost thereof by consumers.\" TILA Section 102(a), 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). A premium or charge for credit insurance or \ndebt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is a cost assessed in connection with credit. The credit transaction \nand the relationship between the creditor and the consumer are the reasons the product is offered or available. \nBecause the merits of this product have long been debated, 90 the Board believes that consumers would benefit \nfrom clear and meaningful disclosures regarding the costs, benefits, and risks associated with this product. As \ndiscussed more fully in \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (3), consumer testing showed that without clear disclosures participants \nwere unaware of the voluntary nature, costs, and eligibility restrictions. For these reasons, the Board believes that \nthis proposed rule would serve to inform consumers of the cost of this credit product.\n\n38(i) Required Deposit\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(i) addresses disclosure requirements when creditors require consumers to maintain deposits as \na condition to the specific transaction, for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Proposed \u00a7 226.38(i) \nis consistent with \u00a7 226.18(r), which applies to transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling. The Board is \nproposing to revise \u00a7 226.18(r) and associated commentary, as discussed above, and proposed \u00a7 226.38(i) reflects \nthe revised text and associated commentary.\n\n38(j) Separate Disclosures\n\nConsumer testing indicated that participants generally felt overwhelmed by the amount of information presented \nthroughout the loan process and especially at consummation. As a result, the Board seeks to streamline the TILA \ndisclosures and focus on the terms that participants stated were important for shopping and for understanding their \nloan terms. Currently, TILA and Regulation Z mandate that the following disclosures be grouped together with the \nrequired disclosures and segregated from everything else: rebate, late payment, property insurance, contract \nreference, and assumption policy. See TILA Sections 128(a)(9), (10), (11), (12), (13) and (b) and 106(c); 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1638(a)(9), (10), (11), (12), (13) and (b) and 1605(c); \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(2), 226.17(a)(1), and 226.18(k)(2), (l), (n), (p), \nand (q). Consumer testing showed that these terms were not of primary importance to consumers in choosing a \nmortgage. With respect to assumption, for example, very few participants understood the language indicating that \nthe loan was assumable, and even fewer felt it was important information. With respect to property insurance, most \nparticipants understood the language indicating that the borrower can obtain property insurance from anyone that is \nacceptable to the lender, but the participants felt that this was not important to their decision making.\n\nTILA Section 105(a) authorizes the Board to make exceptions to TILA to effectuate the statute's purposes, which \nincludes promoting the informed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a), 1604(a). The Board believes that requiring these \ndisclosures to appear separately from the other required disclosures would improve the consumer's ability to focus \non the terms most useful to evaluating the proposed credit transaction.\n\nTILA Section 105(f) authorizes the Board to exempt any class of transactions from coverage under any part of TILA \nif the Board determines that coverage under that part does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the \nform of useful information or protection. 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(1). TILA Section 105(f) directs the Board to make this \ndetermination in light of specific factors. 15 U.S.C. 1604(f)(2). These factors are (1) the amount of the loan and \n\n90 See, e.g., Credit CARD Act of 2009, Public Law No. 111-24, \u00a7 509; 123 Stat. 1734, 1763 (2009) (requiring the General \nAccounting Office to provide a report to Congress by December 31, 2010, of the suitability of credit insurance, debt cancellation \nagreements, and debt suspension agreements for target customers, the \"predatory nature\" of such offers, and the loss rates \ncompared to more traditional insurance products).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nwhether the disclosure provides a benefit to consumers who are parties to the transaction; (2) the extent to which \nthe requirement complicates, hinders, or makes more expensive the credit process for the class of transactions; (3) \nthe status of the borrower, including any related financial arrangements of the borrower, the financial sophistication \nof the borrower relative to the type of transaction, and the importance to the borrower of the credit, related \nsupporting property, and coverage under TILA; (4) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the \nconsumer; and (5) whether the exemption would undermine the goal of consumer protection. Although a credit \ntransaction secured by real property or a dwelling is important to the borrower, the Board believes that removing \nthese disclosures from the other segregated information would further, rather than undermine, the goal of consumer \nprotection because consumers would then focus on the terms that are most important to their decision making \nprocess. The proposed rule would still require that the information be disclosed but would simply no longer require \nthe disclosures to be provided with the segregated information.\n\n38(j)(1) Itemization of Amount Financed\n\nTILA Section 128(a)(2)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1638(a)(2)(B), and \u00a7 226.18(c) currently require that the creditor provide the \nconsumer with a notice that an itemization of amount financed is available on request and to provide it when the \nconsumer so requests. Regulation Z also provides that the good faith estimate of settlement costs (GFE) provided \npursuant to RESPA suffices to satisfy the itemization of amount financed requirement. See \u00a7 226.18(c)(1), fn. 40. \nThe staff commentary provides further that the HUD-1 settlement statement provided at settlement under RESPA \nalso may be substituted for the itemization in connection with later disclosures made pursuant to \u00a7 226.19(a). See \ncomment 18(c)-4.\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1) would mirror the rules currently found under \u00a7 226.18(c) permitting a creditor to provide \ndisclosures pursuant to RESPA in lieu of the itemization of amount financed. These rules originally were \nestablished by the Board pursuant to its authority under TILA Section 105(a) to make exceptions to facilitate \ncompliance with TILA, and the Board is proposing to permit similar treatment under the same authority. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(j)(1) would differ from current \u00a7 226.18(c), as discussed below, to reflect recent changes to Regulation Z.\n\nUnder the proposal, the provisions permitting substitution of RESPA disclosures for the itemization of amount \nfinanced would be removed from \u00a7 226.18 and included under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1). That section would govern \nthe itemization disclosure contents for mortgage transactions, including all those subject to RESPA. As noted \nabove, the Board also is proposing to make certain technical and conforming amendments under \u00a7 226.18(c).\n\nProposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i) would provide the same four categories of the itemization as currently appear in \u00a7 \n226.18(c)(1)--the amount of proceeds distributed directly to the consumer, the amount credited to the consumer's \naccount, amounts paid to other persons on the consumer's behalf, and the prepaid finance charge. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(j)(1)(ii) similarly would provide to creditors the alternative under current \u00a7 226.18(c)(2) of disclosing the right \nto receive an itemization and providing it when the consumer so requests, instead of delivering the itemization \nroutinely. Finally, proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(iii) would provide the alternative of substituting the RESPA GFE for the \nitemization. It also would state a parallel alternative of substituting the HUD-1 settlement statement for the \nitemization when a creditor provides later disclosures pursuant to \u00a7 226.19(a)(2), which currently is addressed only \nin the staff commentary under \u00a7 226.18(c). And proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(iii) would provide that the substitution is \npermissible for any transaction subject to \u00a7 226.38, whether subject to RESPA or not.\n\nThe Board notes that the timing of the HUD-1 settlement statement no longer is consistent with the timing of the \nTILA redisclosure under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). Regulation X under RESPA requires the HUD-1 to be provided at \nsettlement, 91 which generally corresponds with consummation of the transaction under Regulation Z. Under the \n\n91 24 CFR 3500.10(b). The settlement agent must provide the borrower with an opportunity to inspect the HUD-1 during the \nbusiness day preceding settlement, but only completed to reflect all information known to the settlement agent at the time.Id. \n3500.10(a).\n\n \n\n\n\nMIDA final rule, and the proposed revisions to \u00a7 226.19 under this proposal, the redisclosure required under \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2) must be received by the consumer at least three business days before consummation of the \ntransaction. As current comment 18(c)-1 provides, and proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1) also would require, the itemization \nmust be provided at the same time as the segregated disclosures. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(iii) would \nprovide that the HUD-1 settlement statement is a permissible substitute for the itemization of amount financed only \nif it is received by the consumer at least three business days prior to consummation, in accordance with \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2).\n\nThe Board realizes that, in general, consumers currently receive a fully completed HUD-1 settlement statement only \nat consummation, in accordance with RESPA's requirements. For this reason, mortgage creditors might not take \nadvantage of the alternative in proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(iii) as widely as they historically have done under \u00a7 \n226.18(c)(1), fn. 40. On the other hand, the Board notes that a creditor that does not avail itself of that alternative \nmust follow one of the other two alternatives. Under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(a) and 226.38(j)(1)(i), the creditor still must \nprovide substantially the same information three business days before consummation. Under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.19(a) and 226.38(j)(1)(ii), the creditor also must do so, at least in those cases where the consumer requests the \nitemization. Further, given the proposed expansion of the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4, discussed above, all of the \ninformation contained in either the good faith estimate or the itemization would have to be firmly established by \nthree business days before consummation so that the creditor can comply with the timing requirements of proposed \n\u00a7 226.19(a)(2).\n\nIn any event, the Board believes that to permit substitution of the HUD-1 settlement statement for the itemization \nwithout requiring that it be delivered three business days before consummation would be inconsistent with the \npurposes of the MDIA amendments. The Board seeks comment on whether creditors would continue to make \nsignificant use of this alternative as proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(iii) would implement it and, if not, whether the \nalternative should be retained. If it should be retained, the Board seeks comment on how it might be structured \nwithout requiring that the HUD-1 settlement statement be received by the consumer earlier than RESPA requires \nwhile also preserving the purposes of the MDIA.\n\n38(j)(2) Through (6) Rebate; Late Payment; Property Insurance; Contract Reference; Assumption Policy\n\nThe Board proposes to use its exception and exemption authorities under TILA Section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), \nto require creditors to provide the following disclosures separately from the other required disclosures: rebate under \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(2), late payment under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(3), property insurance under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(j)(4), contract reference under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(5), and assumption policy under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(j)(6). The Board is not proposing to change the substantive content of these disclosures. Proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(j) would mirror \u00a7 226.18, except that the proposed requirement would be provided separately from the other \nrequired disclosures. The proposed comments for these disclosures would also parallel the applicable comments \nunder \u00a7 226.18.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes Model Clauses at Appendix H-23 for the following non-segregated disclosures: \nrebate, late payment, property insurance, contract reference, and assumption policy. The Model Clauses are based \non the Board's consumer testing and the Board believes that model clauses will enhance consumer understanding \nof the information, helping consumers to avoid the uninformed use of credit.\n\nAppendices G and H--Open-End and Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses\n\nAppendices G and H set forth model forms, model clauses and sample forms that creditors may use to comply with \nthe requirements of Regulation Z. Appendix G contains model forms, model clauses and sample forms applicable to \n\n \n\n\n\nopen-end plans. Appendix H contains model forms, model clauses and sample forms applicable to closed-end \nloans. Although use of the model forms and clauses is not required, creditors using them properly will be deemed to \nbe in compliance with the regulation with regard to those disclosures. As discussed above, the Board proposes to \nrevise or add several model forms, model clauses and sample forms to Appendix H for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. The revised or new model forms and clauses, and sample forms, are discussed above in the \nsection-by-section analysis applicable to the regulatory provisions to which the forms or clauses relate. See \ndiscussion under \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b), 226.20(c)-(e), and 226.38(a)-(j). In addition, the Board proposes to add new model \nclauses and a sample form relating to credit insurance, debt cancellation and debt suspension coverage to both \nAppendix G and H for open-end and closed-end loans. These model clauses and sample forms are discussed \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (3) and 226.38(h). In Appendix H, all other existing forms and clauses applicable \nto transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling have been retained without revision.\n\nThe Board also proposes to revise or add commentary to the model forms, model clauses and sample forms in \nAppendix H, as discussed below. The Board solicits comments on the proposed revisions below, as well as whether \nany additional commentary should be added to explain the forms and clauses contained in Appendix H.\n\nPermissible Changes\n\nThe commentary to appendices G and H currently states that creditors may make certain changes in the format and \ncontent of the model forms and clauses, and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a transaction or a \nplan without losing the Act's protection from liability. However, certain formatting changes may not be made with \nrespect to certain model and sample forms in Appendix G. See comment app. G and H-1. As discussed above, the \nBoard is proposing format and content requirements with respect to disclosures for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling, such as a tabular requirement for ARM loan program disclosures and ARM adjustment \nnotices, and transaction-specific disclosures required for loans secured by real property or a dwelling. See \nproposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b), 226.20(c), and 226.38(a)-(j). Accordingly, the Board would amend comment app. G and H-\n1 to indicate that certain formatting changes may not be made with respect to certain model forms, model clauses \nand sample forms in Appendix H. In addition, as discussed more fully under \u00a7 226.38, the Board proposes to \nrequire creditors to provide disclosures for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling only as applicable. As \na result, the Board would not allow creditors to use multi-purpose forms; the Board would amend comment app. G \nand H-1(vi) to clarify that the use of multi-purpose standard forms is not permitted for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. See discussion under \u00a7 226.37(a)(2).\n\nDebt Cancellation Coverage\n\nCurrently, commentary to appendices G and H states that creditors are not authorized to characterize debt-\ncancellation fees as insurance premiums for purposes of the regulation. The Board proposes to amend comment \napp. G and H-2 to clarify that the commentary also applies to debt suspension fees.\n\nAppendix H--Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses\n\nModel Forms, Model Clauses, and Sample Forms for Closed-End Disclosures\n\nAs noted above, the Board proposes a new disclosure regime under \u00a7 226.38 for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. As a result, the following sample forms are rendered unnecessary and deleted: Sample H-13 \n(mortgage with demand feature sample); Sample H-14 (variable-rate mortgage sample); and Sample H-15 \n(graduated-payment mortgage sample). Comment app. H-1 would be revised to reflect the deletion of Samples H-\n13 through H-15. The Board would further amend comment app. H-1 to reflect that, under the proposal, new model \nclauses are added regarding credit life insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension disclosures, and creditor-\n\n\n\nplaced property insurance disclosures. See discussion under \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1) and (3), 226.38(h), and 226.20(e). \nThese deleted samples forms and new model clauses are discussed more fully below.\n\nCurrently, comment app. H-2 addresses the flexibility given to creditors in providing the itemization of amount \nfinanced disclosure required under current \u00a7 226.18(c) and illustrated by Model Clause H-3. As discussed above, \nthe Board is proposing new \u00a7 226.38(j)(1) regarding disclosure of the itemization of amount financed for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. As a result, the Board would amend comment app. H-2 to \nupdate cross-references. In a technical revision, the Board would amend comment app. H-3 to clarify that the \nguidance applies to new Model Clauses H-4(B) and H-4(C), H-4(H), H-16, H-17(A) and H-17(C), H-18, and H-20 \nthrough H-23. These new model clauses are discussed more fully below.\n\nModel Forms, Model Clauses, and Sample Forms for ARM Loan Program Disclosures\n\nCurrently, Appendix H contains several model clauses, and a sample form, related to variable-rate loan program \ndisclosures required under current \u00a7 226.18(f)(1), 226.18(f)(2) and 226.19(b). Current Model Clause H-4(A) \ncontains model clauses for variable-rate disclosures required under \u00a7 226.18(f)(1) for transactions not secured by a \nprincipal dwelling, or transactions secured by a dwelling with a term of one year or less. Current Model Clause H-\n4(B) contains model clauses for variable-rate disclosures for transactions that are secured by a principal dwelling \nwith a term greater than one year. Current Model Clause H-4(C) contains model clauses related to variable-rate \nloan program disclosures required under \u00a7 226.19(b). Current Sample H-14 is a sample disclosure illustrating \nrequired disclosures under current \u00a7 226.19(b) of interest rate and monthly payment changes, as well as an \nhistorical example, for variable-rate loan programs.\n\nUnder the proposal, the Board would require new disclosures under \u00a7 226.19(b) for adjustable-rate loan programs, \nand would revise \u00a7 226.18(f)(1) and delete \u00a7 226.18(f)(2) to reflect such proposed changes to \u00a7 226.19(b). \nAccordingly, the Board proposes to delete current Model Clause H-4(B) and add new Model H-4(B) to illustrate, in \nthe tabular format, the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.19(b) for adjustable-rate transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling. The Board also would delete current Model Clause H-4(C) and add new Model Clauses H-\n4(C) to reflect the proposed changes to \u00a7 226.19(b), as discussed above, and to provide model clauses regarding \ninterest rate carryover, conversion features, and preferred rates. The Board proposes to add Samples H-4(D) \nthrough H-4(F) to provide examples of how certain disclosures under \u00a7 226.19(b) may be provided, in the tabular \nformat, for adjustable-rate loan programs that contain a hybrid, interest only, or payment option feature, \nrespectively. In addition, the heading to Model Clause H-4(A) would be revised to update the cross-reference to \u00a7 \n226.18(f), and current Sample H-14 regarding variable-rate disclosures would be deleted and reserved.\n\nThe Board also proposes to revise existing commentary that provides guidance to creditors on how to use current \nModel Clauses H-4(A) through (C). Currently, comments app. H-4 through H-6 provide guidance regarding variable-\nrate loan program disclosures required under current \u00a7\u00a7 226.18(f)(1)-(2) and 226.19(b). Under the proposal, the \nBoard would delete guidance contained in current comment app. H-5 regarding disclosures under \u00a7 226.18(f)(2) as \nunnecessary, and instead provide that disclosures required under \u00a7 226.19(b) for adjustable-rate transactions be \nprovided in the tabular format, as illustrated by Model H-4(B), and Samples H-4(D) through H-4(F). The Board also \nwould delete guidance currently contained in comment app. H-6 relating to variable-rate disclosures, and instead \nprovide guidance regarding model clauses on carryover interest, a conversion feature, or a preferred rate. In a \ntechnical revision, the Board would revise comment app. H-4 to update the cross-reference to \u00a7 226.18(f).\n\nModel Forms, Model Clauses, and Sample Forms for ARM Adjustment Notices\n\nCurrently, Appendix H contains Model Clause H-4(D), which contains model clauses regarding interest rate and \npayment adjustment notices required for variable-rate transactions under current \u00a7 226.20(c). As discussed above \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.20(c), the Board proposes new timing and disclosure requirements regarding interest rate \nand payment changes for adjustable-rate transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the Board would add a model form and two samples forms to illustrate, in the tabular format, the \ndisclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(2) for ARM adjustment notices when there is an interest rate and \npayment change. See proposed Model H-4(G) and Samples H-4(I) and H-4(J). In addition, the Board proposes to \nadd a model form to illustrate disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.20(c)(3) when there is an interest rate \nadjustment without any change to payment. See proposed Model H-4(K). Current Model Clause H-4(D) would be \ndeleted and new Model Clauses H-4(H) would be added to reflect the proposed changes to \u00a7 226.20(c), as \ndiscussed above. The Board also proposes to revise current comment app. H-7 to provide that disclosures required \nunder \u00a7 226.20(c) be provided in the tabular format, as illustrated by new Model H-4(G), and Samples H-4(I) and H-\n4(J).\n\nModel Forms, Model Clauses, and Sample Forms for Periodic Statements\n\nCurrently, creditors are not required to provide certain disclosures with respect to periodic statements for loans that \nare negatively amortizing. As discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.20(d), the Board would require creditors to disclose \nperiodic payment options on a monthly basis for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling that offer \npayment options and are negatively amortizing. Accordingly, the Board is proposing to add new Model Form H-4(L) \nthat creditors may use to comply with the requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.20(d).\n\nModel Clauses for Section 32 (HOEPA) Disclosures\n\nCurrently, Appendix H contains Mortgage Sample H-16, which provides model clauses for disclosures required \nunder \u00a7 226.32(c), such as a notice to the borrower that he or she is not obligated to accept the terms of the loan \nand security interest disclosures. As discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.32(c)(1), the Board would require creditors to \nprovide plain-language versions of the \"no obligation\" and \"security interest\" disclosures to better inform consumers \nwho are considering obtaining HOEPA loans. The Board would revise Mortgage Sample H-16 accordingly. In \naddition, the Board proposes to revise commentary currently contained in comment app. H-20 to clarify that these \ndisclosures are required for all HOEPA loans, and as noted below, would move this commentary to current \ncomment app. H-17. In a technical revision, the Board would revise the heading to Mortgage Sample H-16 to reflect \nthat it contains model clauses.\n\nModel Clause for Credit Insurance, Debt Cancellation, or Debt Suspension\n\nCurrently, Appendix H contains a model clause and sample form that creditors may use to comply with the \ndisclosure requirements under current \u00a7 226.4(d)(3) for debt suspension. See Model Clause H-17(A) and Sample \nH-17(B). As discussed above, the Board proposes new disclosure requirements for credit insurance, debt \ncancellation and debt suspension for all closed-end loans. See proposed \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1), (d)(3) and 226.38(h). \nAccordingly, the Board proposes to add Model Clause H-17(C) and Sample H-17(D) that creditors may use to \ncomply with the proposed requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(d)(1), (d)(3) and 226.38(h).\n\nModel Clause for Creditor-Placed Property Insurance\n\nCurrently, creditors are not required to provide any disclosures to the consumer with respect to creditor-placed \nproperty insurance. As discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.20(e), the Board would require creditors to provide notice \nof the cost and coverage of creditor-placed property insurance before charging the consumer for such insurance for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. For all other closed-end loans, these disclosures would be \nrequired if creditors intend to exclude the creditor-placed property insurance fee from the finance charge under \u00a7 \n226.4(d). Accordingly, the Board proposes to add Model Clause H-18 that creditors may use to comply with the \nproposed requirements under \u00a7 226.20(e).\n\n\n\nModel Forms, Model Clauses, and Sample Forms for Transaction-Specific Disclosures for Loans Secured \nby Real Property or a Dwelling\n\nCurrently, Appendix H contains several model forms, model clauses and samples that creditors may use to comply \nwith the disclosures required under current \u00a7 226.18 for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Current \nModel H-2 illustrates the format and content of disclosures currently required under \u00a7 226.18 for mortgages. Current \nModel Clause H-6 contains a model clause for an assumption policy. Current Samples H-13 and H-15 are sample \ndisclosures illustrating a mortgage with a demand feature and a graduated-payment mortgage, respectively.\n\nAs discussed under proposed \u00a7 226.38, the Board proposes a new disclosure regime for transactions secured by \nreal property or a dwelling. Accordingly, the Board proposes to add new Model Forms, Model Clauses, and Sample \nForms H-19 through H-23 that creditors may use to comply with the requirements in proposed \u00a7 226.38(a) through \n(j). The Board proposes to add Models H-19(A) through H-19(C) to illustrate the format and content of disclosures \nrequired under proposed \u00a7 226.38 for fixed-rate, hybrid adjustable-rate, and payment option mortgages, \nrespectively. In addition, the Board would add Model Clauses H-20 and H-21 to provide guidance to creditors on \nhow to disclose a balloon payment or introductory rate feature, respectively. Model Clause H-22 would be added to \nprovide model clauses relating to key questions about risk disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.38(d)(2). \nModel Clause H-23 would be added to provide model clauses for the following disclosures required under proposed \n\u00a7 226.38(j)(2)-(6) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling: rebate; late payment; property insurance; \ncontract reference; and assumption policy. Under the proposal, current Samples H-13 and H-15 would be rendered \nunnecessary and therefore, are deleted and reserved. Model Clause H-6, which contains the current model clause \nfor assumption, would be deleted because assumption policies are only applicable to transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling; H-6 would be reserved.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposes to add several sample forms to provide examples of how creditors can provide \ncertain disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.38 in the tabular format or scaled graph, as applicable, for \nvarious transaction types secured by real property or a dwelling. Specifically, proposed Samples H-19(D) through \nH-19(I) illustrate disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.38 for the following transaction-types, respectively: a \nfixed mortgage with balloon payment; an interest only, fixed mortgage; a step-payment mortgage; a hybrid \nadjustable-rate mortgage; an interest-only ARM; and a payment option ARM.\n\nThe Board also proposes to add or revise commentary to provide guidance to creditors on the purpose of the \nsample forms, and how to use Model Forms, Model Clauses, and Sample Forms H-19 through H-23 for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Current comment app. H-12 provides guidance to creditors \nregarding the purpose of sample forms generally. Under the proposal, the Board would update the cross-references \ncontained in current comment app. H-12 to clarify that the commentary applies to proposed Sample H-4(D) through-\n4(F) for ARM loan program disclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b); Samples H-4(I) and H-4(J) for ARM \nadjustment notice disclosures required under \u00a7 226.20(c); Sample H-17(D) for credit insurance, debt cancellation or \ndebt suspension disclosures required under \u00a7 226.4(d)(1), (d)(3) and 226.38(h); and Samples H-19(D) through H-\n19(I) for disclosures required under \u00a7 226.38 for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\nCurrent comment app. H-16 provides guidance regarding the sample forms that creditors may use to illustrate \nrequired disclosures for mortgages subject to RESPA and would be updated to include cross-references to \nproposed Samples H-19(D) through H-19(I), and to the itemization of amount financed disclosure under proposed \u00a7 \n226.38(j)(1)(iii). Under the proposal, guidance contained in current comment app. H-17 regarding disclosure of a \nmortgage with a demand feature under \u00a7 226.18 would be deleted as unnecessary. As noted above, commentary \nregarding disclosures required under \u00a7 226.32(c) for HOEPA loans would be moved from comment app. H-20 to \ncomment app. H-17.\n\nIn addition, under the proposal, current comment app. H-18, which contains guidance relating to variable-rate \ndisclosures required under current \u00a7 226.19(b), would be deleted. New commentary would be added to comment \napp. H-18 to provide format details about proposed sample forms that illustrate the disclosures required for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling under proposed \u00a7 226.19(b) or 226.38, as applicable. For \n\n\n\nexample, the commentary indicates that Samples H-4(D) through H-4(F), and H-19(D) through H-19(I) are designed \nto be printed on an 8 1/2 x11 inch sheet of paper. In addition, the following formatting techniques were used in \npresenting the information in the table to ensure that the information was readable:\n\n1. A readable font style and font size (10-point Ariel font style, except for the APR which is shown in 16-point type).\n\n2. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text. That is, words were not compressed to appear smaller than 10-point \ntype, except for headings used to provide interest rate and payment summary disclosures required under proposed \n\u00a7 226.28(c), in the tabular format, which are shown in 9-point type.\n\n3. Standard spacing between words and characters.\n\n4. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each row, by providing sufficient margins above, \nbelow and to the sides of the text.\n\n5. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Black text was used on white paper.\n\nAlthough the Board is not requiring creditors to use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the \ntable (except for the 10-point and 16-point font size), the Board encourages creditors to consider these techniques \nwhen disclosing information in the tabular format, or scaled graph, to ensure that the information is presented in a \nreadable format.\n\nUnder the proposal, commentary currently contained in comment app. H-19 regarding the terms of a graduated-\npayment mortgage would be deleted, and would instead indicate the terms of the fixed-rate mortgage illustrated in \nSample H-19(D). As noted above, guidance contained in current app.\n\nH-20 regarding disclosures required under \u00a7 226.32(c) would be moved to comment app. H-17. The Board \nproposes to add new commentary to comment app. H-20 to indicate the terms of the interest-only, fixed-rate \nmortgage illustrated in Sample H-19(E). The Board also proposes to add comments app. H-21 through -24 to \nindicate the terms of the following transaction types, which are illustrated in Samples H-19(F) through 19(I), \nrespectively: a step-payment mortgage; a hybrid ARM; an interest-only ARM; and a payment option ARM. The \ntransactions discussed in revised comments app. H-19 and H-20, and new comments app. H-21 through -24, all \nassume the average prime offer rates (APORs) that would be used in providing the disclosures required under \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(b), and are not representative of the actual APORs for the respective weeks.\n\nFurther, the Board proposes to add comments app. H-25 through-28 relating to the following, respectively: the \ndisclosure required under proposed \u00a7 226.38(c) for a balloon payment feature; the disclosure required under \nproposed \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(iii) for transactions that have an initial discounted rate that later adjusts; disclosures \nrequired under proposed \u00a7 226.19(d)(2) for key questions about risk that would be provided only as applicable; and \ndisclosures required under proposed \u00a7 226.38(j)(2)-(6) that would be provided separately from disclosures required \nunder proposed \u00a7 226.38(a)-(j). In a technical revision, current comments app. H-21 through -24, which contain \nguidance relating to forms issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and approved for certain \nstudent loans, would be redesignated as comments app. H-29 through-32, respectively; no substantive change is \nintended.\n\nVII. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork\n\nReduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 CFR part 1320 Appendix A.1), the Board reviewed the proposed \nrule under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The collection of \ninformation that is required by this proposed rule is found in 12 CFR part 226. The Board may not conduct or \nsponsor, and an organization is not required to respond to, this information collection unless the information \ncollection displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control number is 7100-0199.\n\n\n\nThis information collection is required to provide benefits for consumers and is mandatory (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). \nSince the Board does not collect any information, no issue of confidentiality arises. The respondents/ recordkeepers \nare creditors and other entities subject to Regulation Z.\n\nTILA and Regulation Z are intended to ensure effective disclosure of the costs and terms of credit to consumers. \nFor open-end credit, creditors are required to, among other things, disclose information about the initial costs and \nterms and to provide periodic statements of account activity, notice of changes in terms, and statements of rights \nconcerning billing error procedures. Regulation Z requires specific types of disclosures for credit and charge card \naccounts and home equity plans. For closed-end loans, such as mortgage and installment loans, cost disclosures \nare required to be provided prior to consummation. Special disclosures are required in connection with certain \nproducts, such as reverse mortgages, certain variable-rate loans, and certain mortgages with rates and fees above \nspecified thresholds. TILA and Regulation Z also contain rules concerning credit advertising. Creditors are required \nto retain evidence of compliance for two years, \u00a7 226.25, but Regulation Z identifies only a few specific types of \nrecords that must be retained. 92\n\nUnder the PRA, the Board accounts for the paperwork burden associated with Regulation Z for the State member \nbanks and other creditors supervised by the Federal Reserve that engage in consumer credit activities covered by \nRegulation Z and, therefore, are respondents under the PRA. Appendix I of Regulation Z defines the Federal \nReserve-regulated institutions as: State member banks, branches and agencies of foreign banks (other than federal \nbranches, federal agencies, and insured State branches of foreign banks), commercial lending companies owned or \ncontrolled by foreign banks, and organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve Act. Other \nfederal agencies account for the paperwork burden imposed on the entities for which they have administrative \nenforcement authority. The current total annual burden to comply with the provisions of Regulation Z is estimated to \nbe 734,127 hours for the 1,138 Federal Reserve-regulated institutions that are deemed to be respondents for the \npurposes of the PRA. To ease the burden and cost of complying with Regulation Z (particularly for small entities), \nthe Board provides model forms, which are appended to the regulation.\n\nAs discussed in the preamble, the Board proposes changes to format, timing, and content requirements for the four \nmain types of credit disclosures for closed-end mortgages governed by Regulation Z: (1) Disclosures at or before \napplication; (2) disclosures within three days after application; (3) disclosures before consummation; and (4) \ndisclosures after consummation. The proposed rule would impose a one-time increase in the total annual burden \nunder Regulation Z for all respondents regulated by the Federal Reserve by 227,600 hours, from 734,127 to \n961,727 hours. In addition, the Board estimates that, on a continuing basis, the proposed revisions to the rules \nwould increase the total annual burden on a continuing basis from 734,127 to 1,280,367 hours.\n\nThe total estimated burden increase, as well as the estimates of the burden increase associated with each major \nsection of the proposed rule as set forth below, represents averages for all respondents regulated by the Federal \nReserve. The Board expects that the amount of time required to implement each of the proposed changes for a \ngiven institution may vary based on the size and complexity of the respondent. Furthermore, the burden estimate \nfor this rulemaking does not include the burden of complying with proposed disclosure and timing requirements that \napply to private educational lenders making private education loans as announced in a separate proposed \nrulemaking (Docket No. R-1353) or the proposed disclosure and timing requirements of the Board's separate notice \npublished simultaneously with this proposal for open-end credit plans secured by real property.\n\n92 See comments 25(a)-3 and -4 and proposed comment 25(a)-5.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Board estimates that 1,138 respondents regulated by the Federal Reserve would take, on average, 200 hours \n(five business weeks) to update their systems, internal procedure manuals, and provide training for relevant staff to \ncomply with the proposed disclosure requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 226.38 and 226.20(d), and revisions to existing disclosure \nrequirements in \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c). This one-time revision would increase the burden by 227,600 hours. \nOn a continuing basis the Board estimates that 1,138 respondents regulated by the Federal Reserve would take, on \naverage, 40 hours a month to comply with the closed-end disclosure requirements and would increase the ongoing \nburden from 304,756 hours to 546,240 hours. To ease the burden and cost of complying with the new and \nproposed requirements under Regulation Z the Board proposes to revise or add several model forms, model \nclauses and sample forms to Appendix H.\n\nThe other federal financial agencies: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Office of Thrift Supervision \n(OTS), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) \nare responsible for estimating and reporting to OMB the total paperwork burden for the domestically chartered \ncommercial banks, thrifts, and federal credit unions and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks for which they \nhave primary administrative enforcement jurisdiction under TILA Section 108(a), 15. U.S.C. 1607(a). These \nagencies are permitted, but are not required, to use the Board's burden estimation methodology. Using the Board's \nmethod, the total current estimated annual burden for the approximately 17,200 domestically chartered commercial \nbanks, thrifts, and federal credit unions and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks supervised by the Federal \nReserve, OCC, OTS, FDIC, and NCUA under TILA would be approximately 13,568,725 hours. The proposed rule \nwould impose a one-time increase in the estimated annual burden for such institutions by 3,440,000 hours to \n17,765,525 hours. On a continuing basis the proposed rule would impose an increase in the estimated annual \nburden by 8,256,000 to 21,824,725 hours. The above estimates represent an average across all respondents; the \nBoard expects variations between institutions based on their size, complexity, and practices.\n\nComments are invited on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper \nperformance of the Board's functions; including whether the information has practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the \nBoard's estimate of the burden of the proposed information collection, including the cost of compliance; (3) ways to \nenhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of \ninformation collection on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms \nof information technology. Comments on the collection of information should be sent to Cynthia Ayouch, Acting \nFederal Reserve Board Clearance Officer, Division of Research and Statistics, Mail Stop 95-A, Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, with copies of such comments sent to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (7100-0199), Washington, DC 20503.\n\nVIII. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n\nIn accordance with section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, the Board is publishing an \ninitial regulatory flexibility analysis for the proposed amendments to Regulation Z. The RFA requires an agency \neither to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with a proposed rule or to certify that the proposed rule will \nnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Under regulations issued by the \nSmall Business Administration, an entity is considered \"small\" if it has $ 175 million or less in assets for banks and \nother depository institutions; and $ 7 million or less in revenues for non-bank mortgage lenders and mortgage \nbrokers. 93\n\n93 13 CFR 121.201.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBased on its analysis and for the reasons stated below, the Board believes that this proposed rule will have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A final regulatory flexibility analysis will be \nconducted after consideration of comments received during the public comment period. The Board requests public \ncomment in the following areas.\n\nA. Reasons for the Proposed Rule\n\nCongress enacted TILA based on findings that economic stability would be enhanced and competition among \nconsumer credit providers would be strengthened by the informed use of credit resulting from consumers' \nawareness of the cost of credit. One of the stated purposes of TILA is to provide a meaningful disclosure of credit \nterms to enable consumers to compare credit terms available in the marketplace more readily and avoid the \nuninformed use of credit. In this regard, the goal of the proposed amendments to Regulation Z is to improve the \neffectiveness of the disclosures that creditors provide to consumers beginning before application and throughout \nthe life of a closed-end mortgage transaction. Accordingly, the Board is proposing changes to format, timing, and \ncontent requirements for closed-end disclosures required by Regulation Z: (1) Program and other educational \ninformation provided before application; (2) transaction-specific disclosures provided at or shortly after application; \n(3) transaction-specific disclosures provided at or three business days before consummation; and notices of \nchanges to the transaction's terms and regarding certain payment options provided during the life of the credit.\n\nCongress enacted HOEPA in 1994 as an amendment to TILA. TILA is implemented by the Board's Regulation Z. \nHOEPA imposed additional substantive protections on certain high-cost mortgage transactions. HOEPA also \ncharged the Board with prohibiting acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans that are unfair, deceptive, or \ndesigned to evade the purposes of HOEPA, and acts or practices in connection with refinancing of mortgage loans \nthat are associated with abusive lending or are otherwise not in the interest of borrowers.\n\nThe proposed regulations would revise and enhance many of the closed-end disclosure requirements of Regulation \nZ for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. The Board's proposal also would require TILA disclosures \nfor closed-end mortgages to be provided to the consumer earlier in the loan process and would expand on the post-\nconsummation notification requirements concerning changes in mortgage terms. These amendments are proposed \nin furtherance of the Board's responsibility to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of TILA, including \npromoting consumers' awareness of the cost of credit and their informed use thereof. Finally, the proposal would \nrestrict certain loan originator compensation practices for closed-end mortgage loans to address problems that have \nbeen observed in the mortgage market. These restrictions are proposed pursuant to the Board's statutory \nresponsibility to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices in connection with mortgage loans.\n\nB. Statement of Objectives and Legal Basis\n\nThe SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION contains this information. In summary, the proposed amendments to \nRegulation Z are designed to achieve three goals: (1) Revise the disclosures required for closed-end mortgage \nloans; (2) restrict certain loan originator compensation practices for mortgage loans; and (3) require disclosures for \nclosed-end mortgage loans to be provided earlier in the transaction and additional post-consummation disclosures \nfor certain changes in terms.\n\nThe legal basis for the proposed rule is in Sections 105(a), 105(f), and 129(l)(2) of TILA. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), 1604(f), \nand 1639(l)(2). A more detailed discussion of the Board's rulemaking authority is set forth in part IV of the \nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.\n\nC. Description of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rule Would Apply\n\n\n\nThe proposed regulations would apply to all institutions and entities that engage in originating or extending closed-\nend, home-secured credit. The Board is not aware of a reliable source for the total number of small entities likely to \nbe affected by the proposal, and the credit provisions of TILA and Regulation Z have broad applicability to \nindividuals and businesses that originate, extend and service even small numbers of home-secured credit. See \u00a7 \n226.1(c)(1). 94 All small entities that originate, extend, or service closed-end loans secured by real property or a \ndwelling potentially could be subject to at least some aspects of the proposed rule.\n\nThe Board can, however, identify through data from Reports of Condition and Income (\"call reports\") approximate \nnumbers of small depository institutions that would be subject to the proposed rules. Based on December 2008 call \nreport data, approximately 9,418 small institutions would be subject to the proposed rule. Approximately 16,345 \ndepository institutions in the United States filed call report data, approximately 11,907 of which had total domestic \nassets of $ 175 million or less and thus were considered small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. \nOf 4,231 banks, 565 thrifts and 7,111 credit unions that filed call report data and were considered small entities, \n4,091 banks, 530 thrifts, and 4,797 credit unions, totaling 9,418 institutions, extended mortgage credit. For \npurposes of this analysis, thrifts include savings banks, savings and loan entities, co-operative banks and industrial \nbanks.\n\nThe Board cannot identify with certainty the number of small non-depository institutions that would be subject to the \nproposed rule. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) 95 data indicate that 1,752 non-depository institutions filed \nHMDA reports in 2007. 96 Based on the small volume of lending activity reported by these institutions, most are \nlikely to be small.\n\nThe proposal's restrictions on compensation of loan originators would apply to mortgage brokers. Loan originators \nother than mortgage brokers that would be affected by the proposal are employees of creditors (or of brokers) and, \nas such, are not business entities in their own right. In its 2008 proposed rule under HOEPA, 73 FR 1672, 1720; \nJan. 9, 2008, the Board noted that, according to the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB), in 2004 \n\n94 Regulation Z generally applies to \"each individual or business that offers or extends credit when four conditions are met: (i) \nThe credit is offered or extended to consumers; (ii) the offering or extension of credit is done regularly, (iii) the credit is subject to \na finance charge or is payable by a written agreement in more than four installments, and (iv) the credit is primarily for personal, \nfamily, or household purposes.\" \u00a7 226.1(c)(1).\n\n \n\n \n\n95 The 8,610 lenders (both depository institutions and mortgage companies) covered by HMDA in 2007 accounted for an \nestimated 80% of all home lending in the United States (2008 HMDA data are not yet available). Under HMDA, lenders use a \n\"loan/application register\" (HMDA/LAR) to report information annually to their Federal supervisory agencies for each application \nand loan acted on during the calendar year. Lenders must make their HMDA/LARs available to the public by March 31 following \nthe year to which the data relate, and they must remove the two date-related fields to help preserve applicants' privacy. Only \nlenders that have offices (or, for non-depository institutions, are deemed to have offices) in metropolitan areas are required to \nreport under HMDA. However, if a lender is required to report, it must report information on all of its home loan applications and \nloans in all locations, including non-metropolitan areas.\n\n96 The 2007 HMDA Data, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2008/articles/hmda/default.htm .\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2008/articles/hmda/default.htm\n\n\nthere were 53,000 mortgage brokerage companies that employed an estimated 418,700 people. 97 The Board \nestimated that most of these companies are small entities. On the other hand, the U.S. Census Bureau's 2002 \nEconomic Census indicates that there were only 17,041 \"mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokers\" in the United \nStates at that time. 98\n\nD. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements\n\nThe compliance requirements of the proposed rules are described in parts V and VI of the SUPPLEMENTARY \nINFORMATION. The effect of the proposed revisions to Regulation Z on small entities is unknown. Some small \nentities would be required, among other things, to modify their home-secured credit disclosures and processes for \ndelivery thereof to comply with the revised rules. The precise costs to small entities of updating their systems and \ndisclosures are difficult to predict. These costs will depend on a number of unknown factors, including, among other \nthings, the specifications of the current systems used by such entities to prepare and provide disclosures and to \nadminister and maintain accounts, the complexity of the terms of credit products that they offer, and the range of \nsuch product offerings.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed rules could affect how loan originators are compensated and would impose certain \nrelated recordkeeping requirements on creditors. The precise costs that the proposed rule would impose on \nmortgage creditors and loan originators are also difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, the Board believes that these \ncosts will have a significant economic effect on small entities, including small mortgage creditors and brokers. The \nBoard seeks information and comment on any costs, compliance requirements, or changes in operating procedures \narising from the application of the proposed rule to small businesses.\n\nE. Identification of Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules\n\nOther Federal Rules\n\nThe Board has not identified any federal rules that conflict with the proposed revisions to Regulation Z.\n\nOverlap With SAFE Act\n\nThe proposed rule's required disclosure contents for closed-end mortgage transactions would overlap with the \nSecure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) by requiring that the disclosure \ninclude the loan originator's unique identifier, as defined by that Act, if applicable.\n\nOverlap With RESPA\n\nCertain terms defined in the proposed rule, such as \"total settlement charges\" cross-reference definitions under the \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Regulation X under the Real Estate Settlement \nProcedures Act (RESPA). The proposed rule also would modify the existing prerequisites for use of the RESPA \n\n97 http://www.namb.org/namb/Industry_Facts.asp?SnID=719224934 . This page of the NAMB Web site, however, no longer \nprovides an estimate of the number of mortgage brokerage companies.\n\n98 http://www.census.gov/prod/ec02/ec0252a1us.pdf  (NAICS code 522310). Data on this industry sector are not yet available \nfrom the 2007 Economic Census.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.namb.org/namb/Industry_Facts.asp?SnID=719224934\nhttp://www.census.gov/prod/ec02/ec0252a1us.pdf\n\n\ngood faith estimate of settlement costs and HUD-1 settlement statement in lieu of the itemization of the amount \nfinanced under Regulation Z.\n\nOverlap With HUD's Guidance\n\nThe Board recognizes that HUD has issued policy statements regarding creditor payments to mortgage brokers \nunder RESPA and guidance as to disclosure of such payments on the Good Faith Estimate and HUD-1 Settlement \nStatement. HUD also has published revised disclosures for broker compensation under RESPA to become effective \nJanuary 1, 2010. The Board intends that its proposal would complement HUD's final rule. The proposed provision \nregarding creditor payments to loan originators is intended to be consistent with HUD's existing guidance regarding \nbroker compensation under Section 8 of RESPA. The proposed provision regarding record retention to evidence \ncompliance with the provision regarding creditor payments to loan originators would cross-reference the HUD-1 \nsettlement statement as an acceptable record of such compensation paid in a given transaction.\n\nF. Identification of Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting State Laws\n\nState Laws Regulating Creditor Payments to Loan Originators\n\nThe Board is aware that many states regulate loan originators, especially mortgage brokers, and their \ncompensation in various respects. Under TILA Section 111, the proposed rule would not preempt such State laws \nexcept to the extent they are inconsistent with the proposal's requirements. 15 U.S.C. 1610.\n\nState Equivalents to TILA and HOEPA\n\nMany states regulate consumer credit through statutory disclosure schemes similar to TILA. Similarly to State laws \nregulating loan originator compensation, such state disclosure laws would be preempted only to the extent they are \ninconsistent with the proposal's requirements. Id.\n\nThe Board also is aware that many states regulate \"high-cost\" or \"high-priced\" mortgage loans, under laws that \nresemble HOEPA. Many such State laws set their coverage tests in part on the APR of the transaction. The \nproposed rule would overlap with these laws indirectly by virtue of the proposal to modify the definition of the \nfinance charge for closed-end mortgage transactions, which would result in APRs being higher generally and \npotentially more loans being covered under such State laws.\n\nThe Board seeks comment regarding any State or local statutes or regulations that would duplicate, overlap, or \nconflict with the proposed rule.\n\nG. Discussion of Significant Alternatives\n\nThe Board considered whether improved disclosures could protect consumers against unfair loan originator \ncompensation practices for mortgages as well as the proposed rule. While the Board is proposing improvements to \nmortgage loan disclosures, it does not appear that better disclosures would address loan originator compensation \npractices adequately.\n\nThe Board welcomes comments on any significant alternatives, consistent with the requirements of TILA, that would \nminimize the impact of the proposed rule on small entities.\n\nList of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 226\n\n\n\nAdvertising, Consumer protection, Federal Reserve System, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Truth in lending.\n\nText of Proposed Revisions\n\nCertain conventions have been used to highlight the proposed revisions. New language is shown inside bold \narrows, and language that would be deleted is shown inside bold brackets.\n\nAuthority and Issuance\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposes to amend Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, as set forth \nbelow:\n\nPART 226--TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)\n\n1. The authority citation for part 226 continues to read as follows:\n\nAuthority: 12 U.S.C. 3806; 15 U.S.C. 1604, 1637(c)(5), and 1639(l); Public Law 111-24 \u00a7 2, 123 Stat. 1734.\n\nSubpart A--General\n\n2. Section 226.1, as amended on January 29, 2009 (74 FR 5397) is amended by revising paragraphs (b) and (d)(5) \nto read as follows:\n\n\u00a7 226.1 Authority, purpose, coverage, organization, enforcement and liability.\n\n* * * *\n\n(b) Purpose. The purpose of this regulation is to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring \ndisclosures about its terms and cost.

Section 226.17 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\u00a7 226.17 General disclosure requirements.\n\n(a) Form of disclosures. (1) The creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and \nconspicuously in writing, in a form that the consumer may keep. In addition, transactions secured by real property or \na dwelling are subject to the requirements under \u00a7 226.37. The disclosures required by this subpart may be \nprovided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer-consent and other applicable \nprovisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). \nFor transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b) or (c) must be provided \nin electronic form in specified circumstances. The disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.17(g), 226.19(b), 226.19(c), and \n\n\n\n226.24 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent or other \nprovisions of the E-Sign Act in the circumstances set forth in those sections. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.18 \nor \u00a7 226.38 shall be grouped together, shall be segregated from everything else, and shall not contain any \ninformation not directly related 37 to the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.18 38 or \u00a7 226.38; however, the \ndisclosures may include an acknowledgement of receipt, the date of the transaction, and the consumer's name, \naddress, and account number. The following disclosures may be made together with or separately from other \nrequired disclosures: the variable-rate example under \u00a7 226.18(f)(4), insurance, debt cancellation, or debt \nsuspension under \u00a7 226.18(n), and certain security interest charges under \u00a7 226.18(o). The itemization of the \namount financed under \u00a7 226.18(c)(1) must be separate from the other disclosures under that section.\n\n(2) Except for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling subject to \u00a7 226.38, t [T]he terms finance charge \nand annual percentage rate, when required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.18(d) and (e) together with a \ncorresponding amount or percentage rate, shall be more conspicuous than any other disclosure, except the \ncreditor's identity under \u00a7 226.18(a).\n\n(b) Time of disclosures. The creditor shall make disclosures before consummation of the transaction. [In certain \nmortgage transactions, special timing requirements are set forth in \u00a7 226.19(a). In certain variable-rate transactions, \nspecial timing requirements for variable-rate disclosures are set forth in \u00a7 226.19(b) and \u00a7 226.20(c).] Special \ndisclosure timing requirements for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling are set forth in \u00a7 226.19(a). \nAdditional disclosure timing requirements for adjustable-rate transactions secured by real property or a dwelling are \nset forth in \u00a7 226.19(b) and \u00a7 226.20(c). In certain transactions involving mail or telephone orders or a series of \nsales, the timing of disclosures may be delayed in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.\n\n(c) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates. (1) Legal obligation. The disclosures required by this subpart shall \nreflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.\n\n(i) Buydowns. The creditor shall disclose an annual percentage rate that is a composite rate based on the interest \nrate in effect during the initial period of the term of the loan and the interest rate in effect for the remainder of the \nterm, if the consumer's interest rate or payments are reduced for all or part of the loan term based on payments \nmade by:\n\n(A) The seller or another third party, if the legal obligation reflects such an arrangement; or\n\n(B) The consumer.\n\n(ii) Wrap-around financing. If a transaction involves combining the outstanding balance on an existing loan with \nadditional funds advanced to a consumer without paying off the outstanding balance, the amount financed shall \nequal the sum of the outstanding balance and the new funds advanced.\n\n(iii) Variable- or adjustable-rate transactions. The creditor shall base disclosures for a variable- or adjustable-rate \ntransaction on the full term of the transaction. Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3) and (c) for adjustable-\nrate mortgage transactions secured by real property or a dwelling:\n\n37 [Reserved] [The disclosures may include an acknowledgment of receipt, the date of the transaction, and the consumer's \nname, address, and account number.]\n\n38 [Reserved] [The following disclosures may be made together with or separately from other required disclosures: the creditor's \nidentity under \u00a7 226.18(a), the variable-rate example under \u00a7 226.18(f)(1)(iv), insurance or debt cancellation under \u00a7 226.18(n), \nand certain security interest charges under \u00a7 226.18(o).]\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n(A) If the initial interest rate for a transaction with a variable or adjustable rate is determined using the index or \nformula used to adjust the interest rate, the disclosures shall reflect the terms in effect at the time of consummation.\n\n(B) If the initial interest rate for a transaction with a variable or adjustable rate is not determined using the index or \nformula used to adjust the interest rate, the disclosures shall reflect a composite annual percentage rate based on \nthe initial rate for the time it is in effect and, for the remainder of the term, the rate that would have applied if such \nindex or formula had been used at the time of consummation.\n\n(iv) Repayment upon occurrence of future event. If disbursements for a transaction secured by real property or a \ndwelling are made during a specified period but repayment is required only upon the occurrence of a future event, \nthe creditor shall base disclosures on the assumption that repayment will occur when disbursements end.\n\n(v) Tax refund-anticipation loans. For a tax refund-anticipation loan, the creditor shall estimate the time a tax refund \nwill be delivered to the consumer and shall include in the finance charge any repayment amount that exceeds the \nloan amount that is not otherwise excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4.\n\n(vi) Pawn transactions. For a pawn transaction, the creditor shall disclose:\n\n(A) The initial sum paid to the consumer as the amount financed;\n\n(B) A finance charge that includes the difference between the initial sum paid to the consumer and the price at \nwhich the item is pledged or sold; and\n\n(C) The annual percentage rate is determined using the earliest date on which the item pledged or sold may be \nredeemed as the end of the loan term.\n\n(2) Estimates. (i) Reasonably available information. If any information necessary for an accurate disclosure is \nunknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure based on the best information reasonably available \nat the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer[,] and shall state clearly that the disclosure is an estimate \n(except that \u00a7 226.19(a) limits the circumstances in which creditors may provide estimated disclosures, for \nmortgage transactions secured by real property or a dwelling).\n\n(ii) Per-diem interest. For a transaction in which a portion of the interest is determined on a per-diem basis and \ncollected at consummation, any disclosure affected by the per-diem interest shall be considered accurate if the \ndisclosure is based on the information known to the creditor at the time that the disclosure documents are prepared \nfor consummation of the transaction.\n\n(3) Disregarded effects. The creditor may disregard the effects of the following in making calculations and \ndisclosures:\n\n(i) That payments must be collected in whole cents.\n\n(ii) That dates of scheduled payments and advances may be changed because the scheduled date is not a \nbusiness day.\n\n(iii) That months have different numbers of days.\n\n(iv) The occurrence of leap year.\n\n(4) Disregarded irregularities. In making calculations and disclosures, the creditor may disregard any irregularity in \nthe first period that falls within the limits described below and any [payment schedule] irregularity in the payment \nschedule, in a transaction not secured by real property or a dwelling, or payment summary, in a transaction secured \nby real property or a dwelling, that results from the irregular first period:\n\n(i) For transactions in which the term is less than 1 year, a first period not more than 6 days shorter or 13 days \nlonger than a regular period;\n\n\n\n(ii) For transactions in which the term is at least 1 year and less than 10 years, a first period not more than 11 days \nshorter or 21 days longer than a regular period; and\n\n(iii) For transactions in which the term is at least 10 years, a first period shorter than or not more than 32 days \nlonger than a regular period.\n\n(5) Demand obligations. If an obligation is payable on demand, the creditor shall make the disclosures based on an \nassumed maturity of 1 year. If an alternate maturity date is stated in the legal obligation between the parties, the \ndisclosures shall be based on that date.\n\n(6) Multiple advance loans.\n\n(i) Series of advances. A series of advances under an agreement to extend credit up to a certain amount may be \nconsidered as one transaction.\n\n(ii) Multiple-advance construction loan. When a multiple-advance loan to finance the construction of a dwelling may \nbe permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as \neither one transaction or more than one transaction.\n\n(d) Multiple creditors; multiple consumers. If a transaction involves more than one creditor, only one set of \ndisclosures shall be given and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor must comply with the \nrequirements that this regulation imposes on any or all of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures \nmay be made to any consumer who is primarily liable on the obligation. If the transaction is rescindable under \u00a7 \n226.23, however, the disclosures shall be made to each consumer who has the right to rescind.\n\n(e) Effect of subsequent events. If a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of an event that occurs after the \ncreditor delivers the required disclosures, the inaccuracy is not a violation of this regulation, although new \ndisclosures may be required under paragraph (f) of this section, \u00a7 226.19, or \u00a7 226.20.\n\n(f) Early disclosures. If disclosures required by this subpart are given before the date of consummation of a \ntransaction and a subsequent event makes them inaccurate, the creditor shall disclose before consummation \n([subject to the provisions of] except that additional timing requirements apply under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) and alternative \ntiming requirements apply under \u00a7 226.19(a)[(5)] (4) (iii)): n39\n\n(1) Any changed term unless the term was based on an estimate in accordance with \u00a7 226.17(c)(2) and was \nlabelled an estimate;\n\n(2) All changed terms, if the annual percentage rate at the time of consummation varies from the annual percentage \nrate disclosed earlier by more than 1/8 of 1 percentage point in a regular transaction, or more than 1/4 of 1 \npercentage point in an irregular transaction, as defined in \u00a7 226.22(a).\n\n(g) Mail or telephone orders-delay in disclosures. Except for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling \nsubject to \u00a7 226.38, i [I]f a creditor receives a purchase order or a request for an extension of credit by mail, \ntelephone, or facsimile machine without face-to-face or direct telephone solicitation, the creditor may delay the \ndisclosures until the due date of the first payment, if the following information for representative amounts or ranges \nof credit is made available in written form or in electronic form to the consumer or to the public before the actual \npurchase order or request:\n\n(1) The cash price or the principal loan amount.\n\n(2) The total sale price.\n\n(3) The finance charge.\n\n\n\n(4) The annual percentage rate, and if the rate may increase after consummation, the following disclosures:\n\n(i) The circumstances under which the rate may increase.\n\n(ii) Any limitations on the increase.\n\n(iii) The effect of an increase.\n\n(5) The terms of repayment.\n\n(h) Series of sales--delay in disclosures. If a credit sale is one of a series made under an agreement providing that \nsubsequent sales may be added to an outstanding balance, the creditor may delay the required disclosures until the \ndue date of the first payment for the current sale, if the following two conditions are met:\n\n(1) The consumer has approved in writing the annual percentage rate or rates, the range of balances to which they \napply, and the method of treating any unearned finance charge on an existing balance.\n\n(2) The creditor retains no security interest in any property after the creditor has received payments equal to the \ncash price and any finance charge attributable to the sale of that property. For purposes of this provision, in the \ncase of items purchased on different dates, the first purchased is deemed the first item paid for; in the case of items \npurchased on the same date, the lowest priced is deemed the first item paid for.\n\n(i) Interim student credit extensions. For each transaction involving an interim credit extension under a student \ncredit program, the creditor need not make the following disclosures: the finance charge under \u00a7 226.18(d), the \npayment schedule under \u00a7 226.18(g), the total of payments under \u00a7 226.18(h), or the total sale price under \u00a7 \n226.18(j).\n\n5. Section 226.18 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\u00a7 226.18 General disclosure requirements.\n\nFor each transaction, the creditor shall disclose the following information as applicable, except that for each \ntransaction secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor shall make the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38:\n\n(a) Creditor.

Relation to other sections. This term is important in [five] three provisions in the regulation:\n\ni. Section 226.4(c)(7)--exclusions from the finance charge\n\nii. Section 226.15(f)--exemption from the right of rescission\n\n[Section 226.18(q)--whether or not the obligation is assumable]\n\n[Section 226.20(b)--disclosure requirements for assumptions]\n\niii. Section 226.23(f)--exemption from the right of rescission\n\n2. Lien status. The definition is not limited to first-lien transactions. [For example, a consumer might assume a paid-\ndown first mortgage (or borrow part of the purchase price) and borrow the balance of the purchase price from a \ncreditor who takes a second mortgage. The second mortgage transaction is a \"residential mortgage transaction\" if \nthe dwelling purchased is the consumer's principal residence.]\n\n* * * *\n\n5. Acquisition. * * *\n\nii. Examples of new transactions involving a previously acquired dwelling include the financing of a balloon payment \ndue under a land sale contract and an extension of credit made to a joint owner of property to buy out the other joint \nowner's interest. [In these instances, disclosures are not required under \u00a7 226.18(q (assumability policies). \nHowever, the] The rescission rules of \u00a7\u00a7 226.15 and 226.23 do apply to these new transactions.\n\n[iii. In other cases, the disclosure and rescission rules do not apply. For example, where a buyer enters into a \nwritten agreement with the creditor holding the seller's mortgage, allowing the buyer to assume the mortgage, if the \nbuyer had previously purchased the property and agreed with the seller to make the mortgage payments, \u00a7 \n226.20(b) does not apply (assumptions involving residential mortgages).]\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.4--Finance Charge.\n\n4(a) Definition.\n\n\n\n1. Charges in comparable cash transactions. Charges imposed uniformly in cash and credit transactions are not \nfinance charges. In determining whether an item is a finance charge, the creditor should compare the credit \ntransaction in question with a similar cash transaction. A creditor financing the sale of property or services may \ncompare charges with those payable in a similar cash transaction by the seller of the property or service.\n\ni. For example, the following items are not finance charges:\n\nA. Taxes, license fees, or registration fees paid by both cash and credit customers.\n\nB. Discounts that are available to cash and credit customers, such as quantity discounts.\n\nC. Discounts available to a particular group of consumers because they meet certain criteria, such as being \nmembers of an organization or having accounts at a particular financial institution. This is the case even if an \nindividual must pay cash to obtain the discount, provided that credit customers who are members of the group and \ndo not qualify for the discount pay no more than the nonmember cash customers.\n\nD. Charges for a service policy, auto club membership, or policy of insurance against latent defects offered to or \nrequired of both cash and credit customers for the same price.\n\nii. In contrast, the following items are finance charges:\n\nA. Inspection and handling fees for the staged disbursement of construction-loan proceeds.\n\nB. Fees for preparing a Truth in Lending disclosure statement, if permitted by law (for example, the Real Estate \nSettlement Procedures Act prohibits such charges in certain transactions secured by real property).\n\nC. Charges for a required maintenance or service contract imposed only in a credit transaction.\n\niii. If the charge in a credit transaction exceeds the charge imposed in a comparable cash transaction, only the \ndifference is a finance charge. For example:\n\nA. If an escrow agent is used in both cash and credit sales of real estate and the agent's charge is $ 100 in a cash \ntransaction and $ 150 in a credit transaction, only $ 50 is a finance charge.\n\n2. Costs of doing business. Charges absorbed by the creditor as a cost of doing business are not finance charges, \neven though the creditor may take such costs into consideration in determining the interest rate to be charged or \nthe cash price of the property or service sold. However, if the creditor separately imposes a charge on the \nconsumer to cover certain costs, the charge is a finance charge if it otherwise meets the definition. For example:\n\ni. A discount imposed on a credit obligation when it is assigned by a seller-creditor to another party is not a finance \ncharge as long as the discount is not separately imposed on the consumer. (See \u00a7 226.4(b)(6).)\n\nii. A tax imposed by a State or other governmental body on a creditor is not a finance charge if the creditor absorbs \nthe tax as a cost of doing business and does not separately impose the tax on the consumer. (For additional \ndiscussion of the treatment of taxes, see other commentary to \u00a7 226.4(a).)\n\n3. Forfeitures of interest. If the creditor reduces the interest rate it pays or stops paying interest on the consumer's \ndeposit account or any portion of it for the term of a credit transaction (including, for example, an overdraft on a \nchecking account or a loan secured by a certificate of deposit), the interest lost is a finance charge. (See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.4(c)(6).) For example:\n\ni. A consumer borrows $ 5,000 for 90 days and secures it with a $ 10,000 certificate of deposit paying 15% interest. \nThe creditor charges the consumer an interest rate of 6% on the loan and stops paying interest on $ 5,000 of the $ \n10,000 certificate for the term of the loan. The interest lost is a finance charge and must be reflected in the annual \npercentage rate on the loan.\n\n\n\nii. However, the consumer must be entitled to the interest that is not paid in order for the lost interest to be a finance \ncharge. For example:\n\nA. A consumer wishes to buy from a financial institution a $ 10,000 certificate of deposit paying 15% interest but \nhas only $ 4,000. The financial institution offers to lend the consumer $ 6,000 at an interest rate of 6% but will pay \nthe 15% interest only on the amount of the consumer's deposit, $ 4,000. The creditor's failure to pay interest on the \n$ 6,000 does not result in an additional finance charge on the extension of credit, provided the consumer is entitled \nby the deposit agreement with the financial institution to interest only on the amount of the consumer's deposit.\n\nB. A consumer enters into a combined time deposit/credit agreement with a financial institution that establishes a \ntime deposit account and an open-end line of credit. The line of credit may be used to borrow against the funds in \nthe time deposit. The agreement provides for an interest rate on any credit extension of, for example, 1%. In \naddition, the agreement states that the creditor will pay 0% interest on the amount of the time deposit that \ncorresponds to the amount of the credit extension(s). The interest that is not paid on the time deposit by the \nfinancial institution is not a finance charge (and therefore does not affect the annual percentage rate computation).\n\n4. Treatment of transaction fees on credit card plans. Any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card \nissuer is a finance charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on \nwithdrawals of funds from an asset account such as a checking or savings account. For example:\n\ni. Any charge imposed on a credit cardholder by a card issuer for the use of an automated teller machine (ATM) to \nobtain a cash advance (whether in a proprietary, shared, interchange, or other system) is a finance charge \nregardless of whether the card issuer imposes a charge on its debit cardholders for using the ATM to withdraw cash \nfrom a consumer asset account, such as a checking or savings account.\n\nii. Any charge imposed on a credit cardholder for making a purchase or obtaining a cash advance outside the \nUnited States, with a foreign merchant, or in a foreign currency is a finance charge, regardless of whether a charge \nis imposed on debit cardholders for such transactions. The following principles apply in determining what is a \nforeign transaction fee and the amount of the fee:\n\nA. Included are fees imposed when transactions are made in a foreign currency and converted to U.S. dollars; fees \nimposed when transactions are made in U.S. dollars outside the U.S.; and fees imposed when transactions are \nmade (whether in a foreign currency or in U.S. dollars) with a foreign merchant, such as via a merchant's Web site. \nFor example, a consumer may use a credit card to make a purchase in Bermuda, in U.S. dollars, and the card \nissuer may impose a fee because the transaction took place outside the United States.\n\nB. Included are fees imposed by the card issuer and fees imposed by a third party that performs the conversion, \nsuch as a credit card network or the card issuer's corporate parent. (For example, in a transaction processed \nthrough a credit card network, the network may impose a 1 percent charge and the card-issuing bank may impose \nan additional 2 percent charge, for a total of a 3 percentage point foreign transaction fee being imposed on the \nconsumer.)\n\nC. Fees imposed by a third party are included only if they are directly passed on to the consumer. For example, if a \ncredit card network imposes a 1 percent fee on the card issuer, but the card issuer absorbs the fee as a cost of \ndoing business (and only passes it on to consumers in the general sense that the interest and fees are imposed on \nall its customers to recover its costs), then the fee is not a foreign transaction fee and need not be disclosed. In \nanother example, if the credit card network imposes a 1 percent fee for a foreign transaction on the card issuer, and \nthe card issuer imposes this same fee on the consumer who engaged in the foreign transaction, then the fee is a \nforeign transaction fee and a finance charge.\n\nD. A card issuer is not required to disclose a fee imposed by a merchant. For example, if the merchant itself \nperforms the currency conversion and adds a fee, this fee need not be disclosed by the card issuer. Under \u00a7 \n226.9(d), a card issuer is not obligated to disclose finance charges imposed by a party honoring a credit card, such \n\n\n\nas a merchant, although the merchant is required to disclose such a finance charge if the merchant is subject to the \nTruth in Lending Act and Regulation Z.\n\nE. The foreign transaction fee is determined by first calculating the dollar amount of the transaction by using a \ncurrency conversion rate outside the card issuer's and third party's control. Any amount in excess of that dollar \namount is a foreign transaction fee. Conversion rates outside the card issuer's and third party's control include, for \nexample, a rate selected from the range of rates available in the wholesale currency exchange markets, an average \nof the highest and lowest rates available in such markets, or a government-mandated or government-managed \nexchange rate (or a rate selected from a range of such rates).\n\nF. The rate used for a particular transaction need not be the same rate that the card issuer (or third party) itself \nobtains in its currency conversion operations. In addition, the rate used for a particular transaction need not be the \nrate in effect on the date of the transaction (purchase or cash advance).\n\n5. Taxes.\n\ni. Generally, a tax imposed by a State or other governmental body solely on a creditor is a finance charge if the \ncreditor separately imposes the charge on the consumer.\n\nii. In contrast, a tax is not a finance charge (even if it is collected by the creditor) if applicable law imposes the tax:\n\nA. Solely on the consumer;\n\nB. On the creditor and the consumer jointly;\n\nC. On the credit transaction, without indicating which party is liable for the tax; or\n\nD. On the creditor, if applicable law directs or authorizes the creditor to pass the tax on to the consumer. (For \npurposes of this section, if applicable law is silent as to passing on the tax, the law is deemed not to authorize \npassing it on.)\n\niii. For example, a stamp tax, property tax, intangible tax, or any other State or local tax imposed on the consumer, \nor on the credit transaction, is not a finance charge even if the tax is collected by the creditor.\n\niv. In addition, a tax is not a finance charge if it is excluded from the finance charge by another provision of the \nregulation or commentary (for example, if the tax is imposed uniformly in cash and credit transactions).\n\n6. Transactions with no seller. In a transaction where there is no seller, such as a refinancing of an existing \nextension of credit described in \u00a7 226.20(a), there is no comparable cash transaction. Thus, the exclusion from the \nfinance charge of charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction does not apply to such transactions.\n\n4(a)(1) Charges by third parties.\n\n1. Choosing the provider of a required service. An example of a third-party charge included in the finance charge is \nthe cost of required mortgage insurance, even if the consumer is allowed to choose the insurer.\n\n2. Annuities associated with reverse mortgages. Some creditors offer annuities in connection with a reverse-\nmortgage transaction. The amount of the premium is a finance charge if the creditor requires the purchase of the \nannuity incident to the credit. Examples include the following:\n\ni. The credit documents reflect the purchase of an annuity from a specific provider or providers.\n\nii. The creditor assesses an additional charge on consumers who do not purchase an annuity from a specific \nprovider.\n\n\n\niii. The annuity is intended to replace in whole or in part the creditor's payments to the consumer either immediately \nor at some future date.\n\n4(a)(2) Special rule; closing agent charges.\n\n1. General. This rule applies to charges by a third party serving as the closing agent for the particular loan. An \nexample of a closing agent charge included in the finance charge is a courier fee where the creditor requires the \nuse of a courier.\n\n2. Required closing agent. If the creditor requires the use of a closing agent, fees charged by the closing agent are \nincluded in the finance charge only if the creditor requires the particular service, requires the imposition of the \ncharge, or retains a portion of the charge. Fees charged by a third-party closing agent may be otherwise excluded \nfrom the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4. For example, a fee that would be paid in a comparable cash transaction \nmay be excluded under \u00a7 226.4(a). A charge for conducting or attending a closing is a finance charge and may be \nexcluded only if the charge is included in and is incidental to a lump-sum fee excluded under \u00a7 226.4(c)(7).\n\n3. Closed-end mortgage transactions. Comments 4(a)(2)-1 and 4(a)(2)-2 do not apply to closed-end transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling, pursuant to \u00a7 226.4(g).fi\n\n4(a)(3) Special rule; mortgage broker fees.\n\n1. General. A fee charged by a mortgage broker is excluded from the finance charge if it is the type of fee that is \nalso excluded when charged by the creditor. For example, to exclude an application fee from the finance charge \nunder \u00a7 226.4(c)(1), a mortgage broker must charge the fee to all applicants for credit, whether or not credit is \nextended.\n\n2. Coverage. This rule applies to charges paid by consumers to a mortgage broker in connection with a consumer \ncredit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n3. Compensation by lender. The rule requires all mortgage broker fees to be included in the finance charge. \nCreditors sometimes compensate mortgage brokers under a separate arrangement with those parties. Creditors \nmay draw on amounts paid by the consumer, such as points or closing costs, to fund their payment to the broker. \nCompensation paid by a creditor to a mortgage broker under an agreement is not included as a separate \ncomponent of a consumer's total finance charge (although this compensation may be reflected in the finance \ncharge if it comes from amounts paid by the consumer to the creditor that are finance charges, such as points and \ninterest).\n\n4(b) Examples of finance charges.\n\n1. Relationship to other provisions. Charges or fees shown as examples of finance charges in \u00a7 226.4(b) may be \nexcludable under \u00a7 226.4(c), (d), or (e). For example[:\n\ni. Premiums], premiums for credit life insurance, shown as an example of a finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(b)(7), \nmay be excluded if the requirements of \u00a7 226.4(d)(1) are met. They may not be excluded, however, in transactions \nsubject to \u00a7 226.4(g).\n\n[ii. Appraisal fees mentioned in \u00a7 226.4(b)(4) are excluded for real property or residential mortgage transactions \nunder \u00a7 226.4(c)(7).]\n\nParagraph 4(b)(2).\n\n1. Checking account charges. A checking or transaction account charge imposed in connection with a credit feature \nis a finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(b)(2) to the extent the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a \ncredit feature. If a charge for an account with a credit feature does not exceed the charge for an account without a \ncredit feature, the charge is not a finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(b)(2). To illustrate:\n\n\n\ni. A $ 5 service charge is imposed on an account with an overdraft line of credit (where the institution has agreed in \nwriting to pay an overdraft), while a $ 3 service charge is imposed on an account without a credit feature; the $ 2 \ndifference is a finance charge. (If the difference is not related to account activity, however, it may be excludable as \na participation fee. See the commentary to \u00a7 226.4(c)(4).\n\nii. A $ 5 service charge is imposed for each item that results in an overdraft on an account with an overdraft line of \ncredit, while a $ 25 service charge is imposed for paying or returning each item on a similar account without a credit \nfeature; the $ 5 charge is not a finance charge.\n\nParagraph 4(b)(3).\n\n1. Assumption fees. The assumption fees mentioned in \u00a7 226.4(b)(3) are finance charges only when the \nassumption occurs and the fee is imposed on the new buyer. The assumption fee is a finance charge in the new \nbuyer's transaction.\n\nParagraph 4(b)(5).\n\n1. Credit loss insurance. Common examples of the insurance against credit loss mentioned in \u00a7 226.4(b)(5) are \nmortgage guaranty insurance, holder in due course insurance, and repossession insurance. Such premiums must \nbe included in the finance charge only for the period that the creditor requires the insurance to be maintained.\n\n2. Residual value insurance. Where a creditor requires a consumer to maintain residual value insurance or where \nthe creditor is a beneficiary of a residual value insurance policy written in connection with an extension of credit (as \nis the case in some forms of automobile balloon-payment financing, for example), the premiums for the insurance \nmust be included in the finance charge for the period that the insurance is to be maintained. If a creditor pays for \nresidual value insurance and absorbs the payment as a cost of doing business, such costs are not considered \nfinance charges. (See comment 4(a)-2.)\n\nParagraphs 4(b)(7) and (b)(8).\n\n1. Pre-existing insurance policy. The insurance discussed in \u00a7 226.4(b)(7) and (b)(8) does not include an insurance \npolicy (such as a life or an automobile collision insurance policy) that is already owned by the consumer, even if the \npolicy is assigned to or otherwise made payable to the creditor to satisfy an insurance requirement. Such a policy is \nnot \"written in connection with\" the transaction, as long as the insurance was not purchased for use in that credit \nextension, since it was previously owned by the consumer.\n\n2. Insurance written in connection with a transaction. Credit insurance sold before or after an open-end [(not home-\nsecured)] plan is opened is considered \"written in connection with a credit transaction.\" Insurance sold after \nconsummation in closed-end credit transactions [or after the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.5b] is not considered \"written in connection with\" the credit transaction if the insurance is \nwritten because of the consumer's default (for example, by failing to obtain or maintain required property insurance) \nor because the consumer requests insurance after consummation [or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to \nthe requirements of \u00a7 226.5b] (although credit-sale disclosures may be required for the insurance sold after \nconsummation if it is financed).\n\n3. Substitution of life insurance. The premium for a life insurance policy purchased and assigned to satisfy a credit \nlife insurance requirement must be included in the finance charge, but only to the extent of the cost of the credit life \ninsurance if purchased from the creditor or the actual cost of the policy (if that is less than the cost of the insurance \navailable from the creditor). If the creditor does not offer the required insurance, the premium to be included in the \nfinance charge is the cost of a policy of insurance of the type, amount, and term required by the creditor.\n\n4. Other insurance. Fees for required insurance not of the types described in \u00a7 226.4(b)(7) and (b)(8) are finance \ncharges and are not excludable. For example:\n\n\n\ni. The premium for a hospitalization insurance policy, if it is required to be purchased only in a credit transaction, is \na finance charge.\n\nParagraph 4(b)(9).\n\n1. Discounts for payment by other than credit. The discounts to induce payment by other than credit mentioned in \u00a7 \n226.4(b)(9) include, for example, the following situation:\n\ni. The seller of land offers individual tracts for $ 10,000 each. If the purchaser pays cash, the price is $ 9,000, but if \nthe purchaser finances the tract with the seller the price is $ 10,000. The $ 1,000 difference is a finance charge for \nthose who buy the tracts on credit.\n\n2. Exception for cash discounts.\n\ni. Creditors may exclude from the finance charge discounts offered to consumers for using cash or another means \nof payment instead of using a credit card or an open-end plan. The discount may be in whatever amount the seller \ndesires, either as a percentage of the regular price (as defined in section 103(z) of the act, as amended) or a dollar \namount. Pursuant to section 167(b) of the act, this provision applies only to transactions involving an open-end \ncredit plan or a credit card (whether open-end or closed-end credit is extended on the card). The merchant must \noffer the discount to prospective buyers whether or not they are cardholders or members of the open-end credit \nplan. The merchant may, however, make other distinctions. For example:\n\nA. The merchant may limit the discount to payment by cash and not offer it for payment by check or by use of a \ndebit card.\n\nB. The merchant may establish a discount plan that allows a 15% discount for payment by cash, a 10% discount for \npayment by check, and a 5% discount for payment by a particular credit card. None of these discounts is a finance \ncharge.\n\nii. Pursuant to section 171(c) of the act, discounts excluded from the finance charge under this paragraph are also \nexcluded from treatment as a finance charge or other charge for credit under any State usury or disclosure laws.\n\n3. Determination of the regular price.\n\ni. The regular price is critical in determining whether the difference between the price charged to cash customers \nand credit customers is a discount or a surcharge, as these terms are defined in amended section 103 of the act. \nThe regular price is defined in section 103 of the act as \"* * * the tag or posted price charged for the property or \nservice if a single price is tagged or posted, or the price charged for the property or service when payment is made \nby use of an open-end credit plan or a credit card if either (1) no price is tagged or posted, or (2) two prices are \ntagged or posted * * *.\"\n\nii. For example, in the sale of motor vehicle fuel, the tagged or posted price is the price displayed at the pump. As a \nresult, the higher price (the open-end credit or credit card price) must be displayed at the pump, either alone or \nalong with the cash price. Service station operators may designate separate pumps or separate islands as being for \neither cash or credit purchases and display only the appropriate prices at the various pumps. If a pump is capable \nof displaying on its meter either a cash or a credit price depending upon the consumer's means of payment, both \nthe cash price and the credit price must be displayed at the pump. A service station operator may display the cash \nprice of fuel by itself on a curb sign, as long as the sign clearly indicates that the price is limited to cash purchases.\n\n4(b)(10) Debt cancellation and debt suspension fees.\n\n1. Definition. Debt cancellation coverage provides for payment or satisfaction of all or part of a debt when a \nspecified event occurs. The term \"debt cancellation coverage\" includes guaranteed automobile protection, or \n\"GAP,\" agreements, which pay or satisfy the remaining debt after property insurance benefits are exhausted. Debt \nsuspension coverage provides for suspension of the obligation to make one or more payments on the date(s) \n\n\n\notherwise required by the credit agreement, when a specified event occurs. The term \"debt suspension\" does not \ninclude loan payment deferral arrangements in which the triggering event is the bank's unilateral decision to allow a \ndeferral of payment and the borrower's unilateral election to do so, such as by skipping or reducing one or more \npayments (\"skip payments\").\n\n2. Coverage written in connection with a transaction. Coverage sold after consummation in closed-end credit \ntransactions [or after the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b] is not \"written in \nconnection with\" the credit transaction if the coverage is written because the consumer requests coverage after \nconsummation [or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of \u00a7 226.5b] (although credit-sale \ndisclosures may be required for the coverage sold after consummation if it is financed). Coverage sold before or \nafter an open-end [(not home-secured)] plan is opened is considered \"written in connection with a credit \ntransaction.\"\n\n4(c) Charges excluded from the finance charge.\n\nParagraph 4(c)(1).\n\n1. Application fees. An application fee that is excluded from the finance charge is a charge to recover the costs \nassociated with processing applications for credit. The fee may cover the costs of services such as credit reports, \ncredit investigations, and appraisals. The creditor is free to impose the fee in only certain of its loan programs, such \nas automobile [mortgage] loans. However, if the fee is to be excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(1), \nit must be charged to all applicants, not just to applicants who are approved or who actually receive credit.\n\nParagraph 4(c)(2).\n\n1. Late-payment charges.\n\ni. Late-payment charges can be excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4(c)(2) whether or not the person \nimposing the charge continues to extend credit on the account or continues to provide property or services to the \nconsumer. In determining whether a charge is for actual unanticipated late payment on a 30-day account, for \nexample, factors to be considered include:\n\nA. The terms of the account. For example, is the consumer required by the account terms to pay the account \nbalance in full each month? If not, the charge may be a finance charge.\n\nB. The practices of the creditor in handling the accounts. For example, regardless of the terms of the account, does \nthe creditor allow consumers to pay the accounts over a period of time without demanding payment in full or taking \nother action to collect? If no effort is made to collect the full amount due, the charge may be a finance charge.\n\nii. Section 226.4(c)(2) applies to late-payment charges imposed for failure to make payments as agreed, as well as \nfailure to pay an account in full when due.\n\n2. Other excluded charges. Charges for \"delinquency, default, or a similar occurrence\" include, for example, \ncharges for reinstatement of credit privileges or for submitting as payment a check that is later returned unpaid.\n\nParagraph 4(c)(3).\n\n1. Assessing interest on an overdraft balance. A charge on an overdraft balance computed by applying a rate of \ninterest to the amount of the overdraft is not a finance charge, even though the consumer agrees to the charge in \nthe account agreement, unless the financial institution agrees in writing that it will pay such items.\n\nParagraph 4(c)(4).\n\n1. Participation fees--periodic basis. The participation fees described in \u00a7 226.4(c)(4) do not necessarily have to be \nformal membership fees, nor are they limited to credit card plans. The provision applies to any credit plan in which \n\n\n\npayment of a fee is a condition of access to the plan itself, but it does not apply to fees imposed separately on \nindividual closed-end transactions. The fee may be charged on a monthly, annual, or other periodic basis; a one-\ntime, nonrecurring fee imposed at the time an account is opened is not a fee that is charged on a periodic basis, \nand may not be treated as a participation fee.\n\n2. Participation fees--exclusions. Minimum monthly charges, charges for nonuse of a credit card, and other charges \nbased on either account activity or the amount of credit available under the plan are not excluded from the finance \ncharge by \u00a7 226.4(c)(4). Thus, for example, a fee that is charged and then refunded to the consumer based on the \nextent to which the consumer uses the credit available would be a finance charge. (See the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.4(b)(2). Also, see comment 14(c)-2 for treatment of certain types of fees excluded in determining the annual \npercentage rate for the periodic statement.)\n\nParagraph 4(c)(5).\n\n1. Seller's points. The seller's points mentioned in \u00a7 226.4(c)(5) include any charges imposed by the creditor upon \nthe non-creditor seller of property for providing credit to the buyer or for providing credit on certain terms. These \ncharges are excluded from the finance charge even if they are passed on to the buyer, for example, in the form of a \nhigher sales price. Seller's points are frequently involved in real estate transactions guaranteed or insured by \ngovernmental agencies. A commitment fee paid by a non-creditor seller (such as a real estate developer) to the \ncreditor should be treated as seller's points. Buyer's points (that is, points charged to the buyer by the creditor), \nhowever, are finance charges.\n\n2. Other seller-paid amounts. Mortgage insurance premiums and other finance charges are sometimes paid at or \nbefore consummation or settlement on the borrower's behalf by a non-creditor seller. The creditor should treat the \npayment made by the seller as seller's points and exclude it from the finance charge if, based on the seller's \npayment, the consumer is not legally bound to the creditor for the charge. A creditor who gives disclosures before \nthe payment has been made should base them on the best information reasonably available.\n\nParagraph 4(c)(6).\n\n1. Lost interest. Certain federal and State laws mandate a percentage differential between the interest rate paid on \na deposit and the rate charged on a loan secured by that deposit. In some situations, because of usury limits the \ncreditor must reduce the interest rate paid on the deposit and, as a result, the consumer loses some of the interest \nthat would otherwise have been earned. Under \u00a7 226.4(c)(6), such \"lost interest\" need not be included in the \nfinance charge. This rule applies only to an interest reduction imposed because a rate differential is required by law \nand a usury limit precludes compliance by any other means. If the creditor imposes a differential that exceeds that \nrequired, only the lost interest attributable to the excess amount is a finance charge. (See the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.4(a).)\n\nParagraph 4(c)(7).\n\n1. [Real estate or residential mortgage transaction] Open-end real-property-secured credit charges. The list of \ncharges in \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) applies to open-end credit plans secured by real property and open-end residential \nmortgage transactions [both to residential mortgage transactions (which may include, for example, the purchase of \na mobile home) and to other transactions secured by real estate.] The fees are excluded from the finance charge \neven if the services for which the fees are imposed are performed by the creditor's employees rather than by a third \nparty. In addition, the cost of verifying or confirming information connected to the item is also excluded. For \nexample, credit-report fees cover not only the cost of the report but also the cost of verifying information in the \nreport. In all cases, charges excluded under \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) must be bona fide and reasonable.\n\n2. Lump-sum charges. If a lump sum charged for several services includes a charge that is not excludable, a \nportion of the total should be allocated to that service and included in the finance charge. However, a lump sum \ncharged for conducting or attending a closing (for example, by a lawyer or a title company) is excluded from the \nfinance charge if the charge is primarily for services related to items listed in \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) (for example, reviewing \n\n\n\nor completing documents), even if other incidental services such as explaining various documents or disbursing \nfunds for the parties are performed. The entire charge is excluded even if a fee for the incidental services would be \na finance charge if it were imposed separately.\n\n3. Charges assessed during the loan term. Charges [Real estate or residential mortgage transaction charges] \nexcluded under \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) are those charges imposed solely in connection with the initial decision to grant credit. \nThis would include, for example, a fee to search for tax liens on the property or to determine if flood insurance is \nrequired. The exclusion does not apply to fees for services to be performed periodically during the loan term, \nregardless of when the fee is collected. For example, a fee for one or more determinations during the loan term of \nthe current tax-lien status or flood-insurance requirements is a finance charge, regardless of whether the fee is \nimposed at closing, or when the service is performed. If a creditor is uncertain about what portion of a fee to be paid \nat consummation or loan closing is related to the initial decision to grant credit, the entire fee may be treated as a \nfinance charge.\n\n4(d) Insurance and debt cancellation and debt suspension coverage.\n\n1. General. Section 226.4(d) permits insurance premiums and charges and debt cancellation and debt suspension \ncharges to be excluded from the finance charge. The required disclosures must be made in writing, except as \nprovided in \u00a7 226.4(d)(4). The rules on location of insurance and debt cancellation and debt suspension disclosures \nfor closed-end transactions are in \u00a7 226.17(a). For purposes of \u00a7 226.4(d), all references to insurance also include \ndebt cancellation and debt suspension coverage unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\n2. Timing of disclosures. If disclosures are given early, for example under \u00a7 226.17(f)[or \u00a7 226.19(a)], the creditor \nmust redisclose if the actual premium is different at the time of consummation. If insurance disclosures are not \ngiven at the time of early disclosure and insurance is in fact written in connection with the transaction, the \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.4(d) must be made in order to exclude the premiums from the finance charge.\n\n3. Premium rate increases. The creditor should disclose the premium amount based on the rates currently in effect \nand need not designate it as an estimate even if the premium rates may increase. An increase in insurance rates \nafter consummation of a closed-end credit transaction or during the life of an open-end credit plan does not require \nredisclosure in order to exclude the additional premium from treatment as a finance charge.\n\n4. Unit-cost disclosures.\n\ni. Open-end credit. The premium or fee for insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension for the initial term of \ncoverage may be disclosed on a unit-cost basis in open-end credit transactions. The cost per unit should be based \non the initial term of coverage, unless one of the options under comment 4(d)-12 is available.\n\nii. Closed-end credit. One of the transactions for which unit-cost disclosures (such as 50 cents per year for each $ \n100 of the amount financed) may be used in place of the total insurance premium involves a particular kind of \ninsurance plan. For example, a consumer with a current indebtedness of $ 8,000 is covered by a plan of credit life \ninsurance coverage with a maximum of $ 10,000. The consumer requests an additional $ 4,000 loan to be covered \nby the same insurance plan. Since the $ 4,000 loan exceeds, in part, the maximum amount of indebtedness that \ncan be covered by the plan, the creditor may properly give the insurance-cost disclosures on the $ 4,000 loan on a \nunit-cost basis.\n\n5. Required credit life insurance; debt cancellation or suspension coverage. Credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-\nincome insurance, and debt cancellation and suspension coverage described in \u00a7 226.4(b)(10), must be voluntary \nin order for the premium or charges to be excluded from the finance charge. Whether the insurance or coverage is \nin fact required or optional is a factual question. If the insurance or coverage is required, the premiums must be \nincluded in the finance charge, whether the insurance or coverage is purchased from the creditor or from a third \nparty. If the consumer is required to elect one of several options--such as to purchase credit life insurance, or to \nassign an existing life insurance policy, or to pledge security such as a certificate of deposit--and the consumer \npurchases the credit life insurance policy, the premium must be included in the finance charge. (If the consumer \n\n\n\nassigns a preexisting policy or pledges security instead, no premium is included in the finance charge. The security \ninterest would be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6(a)(4), \u00a7 226.6(b)(5)(ii), or \u00a7 226.18(m). See the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.4(b)(7) and (b)(8).)\n\n6. Other types of voluntary insurance. Insurance is not credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance if the \ncreditor or the credit account of the consumer is not the beneficiary of the insurance coverage. If the premium for \nsuch insurance is not imposed by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of credit, it is not covered by \u00a7 226.4.\n\n7. Signatures. If the creditor offers a number of insurance options under \u00a7 226.4(d), the creditor may provide a \nmeans for the consumer to sign or initial for each option, or it may provide for a single authorizing signature or initial \nwith the options selected designated by some other means, such as a check mark. The insurance authorization \nmay be signed or initialed by any consumer, as defined in \u00a7 226.2(a)(11), or by an authorized user on a credit card \naccount.\n\n8. Property insurance. To exclude property insurance premiums or charges from the finance charge, the creditor \nmust allow the consumer to choose the insurer and disclose that fact. This disclosure must be made whether or not \nthe property insurance is available from or through the creditor. The requirement that an option be given does not \nrequire that the insurance be readily available from other sources. The premium or charge must be disclosed only if \nthe consumer elects to purchase the insurance from or through the creditor; in such a case, the creditor must also \ndisclose the term of the property insurance coverage if it is less than the term of the obligation. Insurance is \navailable \"from or through a creditor\" if it is available from the creditor's affiliate, as defined under the Bank Holding \nCompany Act, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k).\n\n9. Single-interest insurance. Blanket and specific single-interest coverage are treated the same for purposes of the \nregulation. A charge for either type of single-interest insurance may be excluded from the finance charge if:\n\ni. The insurer waives any right of subrogation.\n\nii. The other requirements of \u00a7 226.4(d)(2) are met. This includes, of course, giving the consumer the option of \nobtaining the insurance from a person of the consumer's choice. The creditor need not ascertain whether the \nconsumer is able to purchase the insurance from someone else.\n\n10. Single-interest insurance defined. The term single-interest insurance as used in the regulation refers only to the \ntypes of coverage traditionally included in the term vendor's single-interest insurance (or VSI), that is, protection of \ntangible property against normal property damage, concealment, confiscation, conversion, embezzlement, and skip. \nSome comprehensive insurance policies may include a variety of additional coverages, such as repossession \ninsurance and holder-in-due-course insurance. These types of coverage do not constitute single-interest insurance \nfor purposes of the regulation, and premiums for them do not qualify for exclusion from the finance charge under \u00a7 \n226.4(d). If a policy that is primarily VSI also provides coverages that are not VSI or other property insurance, a \nportion of the premiums must be allocated to the non-excludable coverages and included in the finance charge. \nHowever, such allocation is not required if the total premium in fact attributable to all of the non-VSI coverages \nincluded in the policy is $ 1.00 or less (or $ 5.00 or less in the case of a multiyear policy).\n\n11. Initial term.\n\ni. The initial term of insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage determines the period for which a \npremium amount must be disclosed, unless one of the options discussed under comment 4(d)-12 is available. For \npurposes of \u00a7 226.4(d), the initial term is the period for which the insurer or creditor is obligated to provide \ncoverage, even though the consumer may be allowed to cancel the coverage or coverage may end due to \nnonpayment before that term expires.\n\nii. For example:\n\n\n\nA. The initial term of a property insurance policy on an automobile that is written for one year is one year even \nthough premiums are paid monthly and the term of the credit transaction is four years.\n\nB. The initial term of an insurance policy is the full term of the credit transaction if the consumer pays or finances a \nsingle premium in advance.\n\n12. Initial term; alternative.\n\ni. General. A creditor has the option of providing cost disclosures on the basis of one year of insurance or debt \ncancellation or debt suspension coverage instead of a longer initial term (provided the premium or fee is clearly \nlabeled as being for one year) if:\n\nA. The initial term is indefinite or not clear, or\n\nB. The consumer has agreed to pay a premium or fee that is assessed periodically but the consumer is under no \nobligation to continue the coverage, whether or not the consumer has made an initial payment.\n\nii. Open-end plans. For open-end plans, a creditor also has the option of providing unit-cost disclosure on the basis \nof a period that is less than one year if the consumer has agreed to pay a premium or fee that is assessed \nperiodically, for example monthly, but the consumer is under no obligation to continue the coverage.\n\niii. Examples. To illustrate:\n\nA. A credit life insurance policy providing coverage for a seven-year automobile [30-year mortgage] loan has an \ninitial term of seven [30] years, even though premiums are paid monthly and the consumer is not required to \ncontinue the coverage. Disclosures may be based on the initial term, but the creditor also has the option of making \ndisclosures on the basis of coverage for an assumed initial term of one year.\n\n13. Loss-of-income insurance. The loss-of-income insurance mentioned in \u00a7 226.4(d) includes involuntary \nunemployment insurance, which provides that some or all of the consumer's payments will be made if the consumer \nbecomes unemployed involuntarily.\n\n14. Age or employment eligibility criteria. A premium or charge for credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income \ninsurance, or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is voluntary and can be excluded from the finance \ncharge only if the consumer meets the product's age or employment eligibility criteria at the time of enrollment. To \nexclude such a premium or charge from the finance charge, the creditor must determine at the time of enrollment \nthat the consumer is eligible for the product under the product's age or employment eligibility restrictions. The \ncreditor may use reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's age or employment status to satisfy this condition. \nReasonably reliable evidence of a consumer's age would include using the date of birth on the consumer's credit \napplication, on the driver's license or other government-issued identification, or on the credit report. Reasonably \nreliable evidence of a consumer's employment status would include the consumer's information on a credit \napplication, an Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, payroll receipts, or other evidence such as a letter \nor e-mail from the consumer or the consumer's employer. If the consumer does not meet the product's age or \nemployment eligibility criteria at the time of enrollment, then the premium or charge is not voluntary. In such \ncircumstances, the premium or charge is a finance charge. If the creditor offers a bundled product (such as credit \nlife insurance combined with credit involuntary unemployment insurance) and the consumer is not eligible for all of \nthe bundled products, then the creditor must either: (1) treat the entire premium or charge for the bundled product \nas a finance charge, or (2) offer the consumer the option of selecting only the products for which the consumer is \neligible and exclude the premium or charge from the finance charge if the consumer chooses an optional product \nfor which the consumer meets the age or employment eligibility criteria at the time of enrollment.\n\n4(d)(3) Voluntary debt cancellation or debt suspension fees.\n\n\n\n1. General. Fees charged for the specialized form of debt cancellation agreement known as guaranteed automobile \nprotection (\"GAP\") agreements must be disclosed according to \u00a7 226.4(d)(3) rather than according to \u00a7 226.4(d)(2) \nfor property insurance.\n\n2. Disclosures. Creditors can comply with \u00a7 226.4(d)(3) by providing a disclosure that refers to debt cancellation or \ndebt suspension coverage whether or not the coverage is considered insurance. Creditors may use the model \ncredit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage constitutes insurance under \nState law. (See Model Clauses and Samples at G-16 and H-17 in Appendix G and Appendix H to part 226 for \nguidance on how to provide the disclosure required by \u00a7 226.4(d)(3)(iii) for debt suspension products.)\n\n3. Multiple events. If debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage for two or more events is provided at a single \ncharge, the entire charge may be excluded from the finance charge if at least one of the events is accident or loss \nof life, health, or income and the conditions specified in \u00a7 226.4(d)(3) or, as applicable, \u00a7 226.4(d)(4), are satisfied.\n\n4. Disclosures in programs combining debt cancellation and debt suspension features. If the consumer's debt can \nbe cancelled under certain circumstances, the disclosure may be modified to reflect that fact. The disclosure could, \nfor example, state (in addition to the language required by \u00a7 226.4(d)(3)(iii)) that \"In some circumstances, my debt \nmay be cancelled.\" However, the disclosure would not be permitted to list the specific events that would result in \ndebt cancellation.\n\n4(d)(4) Telephone purchases.\n\n1. Affirmative request. A creditor would not satisfy the requirement to obtain a consumer's affirmative request if the \n\"request\" was a response to a script that uses leading questions or negative consent. A question asking whether \nthe consumer wishes to enroll in the credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension plan and seeking a yes-or-\nno response (such as \"Do you want to enroll in this optional debt cancellation plan?\") would not be considered \nleading.\n\n4(e) Certain security interest charges.\n\n1. Examples.\n\ni. Excludable charges. Sums must be actually paid to public officials to be excluded from the finance charge under \u00a7 \n226.4(e)(1) and (e)(3). Examples are charges or other fees required for filing or recording security agreements, \nmortgages (for open-end credit; but see \u00a7 226.4(g) regarding closed-end mortgage credit), continuation statements, \ntermination statements, and similar documents, as well as intangible property or other taxes even when the charges \nor fees are imposed by the state solely on the creditor and charged to the consumer (if the tax must be paid to \nrecord a security agreement). (See comment 4(a)-5 regarding the treatment of taxes, generally.)\n\nii. Charges not excludable. If the obligation is between the creditor and a third party (an assignee, for example), \ncharges or other fees for filing or recording security agreements, mortgages, continuation statements, termination \nstatements, and similar documents relating to that obligation are not excludable from the finance charge under this \nsection.\n\n2. Itemization. The various charges described in \u00a7 226.4(e)(1) and (e)(3) may be totaled and disclosed as an \naggregate sum, or they may be itemized by the specific fees and taxes imposed. If an aggregate sum is disclosed, \na general term such as security interest fees or filing fees may be used.\n\n3. Notary fees. In order for a notary fee to be excluded under \u00a7 226.4(e)(1), all of the following conditions must be \nmet:\n\ni. The document to be notarized is one used to perfect, release, or continue a security interest.\n\nii. The document is required by law to be notarized.\n\n\n\niii. A notary is considered a public official under applicable law.\n\niv. The amount of the fee is set or authorized by law.\n\n4. Non-filing insurance. The exclusion in \u00a7 226.4(e)(2) is available only if non-filing insurance is purchased. If the \ncreditor collects and simply retains a fee as a sort of \"self-insurance\" against non-filing, it may not be excluded from \nthe finance charge. If the non-filing insurance premium exceeds the amount of the fees excludable from the finance \ncharge under \u00a7 226.4(e)(1), only the excess is a finance charge. For example:\n\ni. The fee for perfecting a security interest is $ 5.00 and the fee for releasing the security interest is $ 3.00. The \ncreditor charges $ 10.00 for non-filing insurance. Only $ 8.00 of the $ 10.00 is excludable from the finance charge.\n\n4(f) Prohibited offsets.\n\n1. Earnings on deposits or investments. The rule that the creditor shall not deduct any earnings by the consumer on \ndeposits or investments applies whether or not the creditor has a security interest in the property.\n\n4(g) Special rule; mortgage transactions.\n\n1. Applicability of commentary to mortgages. The staff commentary under \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(a)(2) and 226.4(c) through (e) \n(other than that under \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(c)(2), 226.4(c)(5), and 226.4(d)(2)) does not apply to closed-end transactions \nsecured by real property or a dwelling. The staff commentary under \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(a) (other than paragraph (2) of that \nsection), 226.4(c)(2), 226.4(c)(5), and 226.4(d)(2), however, does apply to such transactions.\n\n2. Third-party charges. Charges imposed by third parties are finance charges if they fit the general definition under \n\u00a7 226.4(a). Thus, if a third-party charge is payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed directly or \nindirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit, it is a finance charge unless it would be payable in \na comparable cash transaction. For example, appraisal and credit report fees are finance charges because they \nmeet the definition in \u00a7 226.4(a). This test generally does not depend on whether the creditor requires the service \nfor which the charge is imposed. In addition, charges imposed by closing agents required by the creditor, whether \ntheir own or those of third parties they retain, generally are finance charges unless otherwise excluded. (Note that \u00a7 \n226.4(a)(2) does not apply to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, pursuant to \u00a7 \n226.4(g).) Insurance premiums generally are finance charges, whether imposed by a closing agent or another \ninsurer, although premiums for property insurance are excluded if \u00a7 226.4(d)(2) is satisfied. Premiums for credit \ninsurance (or fees for debt cancellation or debt suspension agreements) and premiums for lender's coverage under \na title insurance policy are finance charges because they are imposed as an incident to the extension of credit. In \ncontrast, premiums for owner's title insurance coverage are not finance charges because they are not imposed as \nan incident to the extension of credit.\n\n3. Charges in comparable cash transactions. While the exclusions in \u00a7 226.4(c) through (e), other than \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.4(c)(5) and 226.4(d)(2) are inapplicable to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, \ncharges in connection with such transactions that are payable in a comparable cash transaction are not finance \ncharges. See comment 4(a)-1. For example, property taxes and fees or taxes imposed to record the deed \nevidencing transfer from the seller to the buyer of title to the property securing the transaction are not finance \ncharges because they would be paid even if no credit were extended to finance the purchase. In contrast, fees or \ntaxes imposed to record the mortgage, deed of trust, or other security instrument evidencing the creditor's security \ninterest in the property securing the transaction are finance charges because they would not be incurred were it not \nfor the extension of credit.\n\n* * * *\n\nSubpart C--Closed-End Credit\n\n\n\n\u00a7 226.17--General Disclosure Requirements.\n\n17(a) Form of Disclosures Paragraph 17(a)(1)\n\n1. Clear and conspicuous. This standard requires that disclosures be in a reasonably understandable form. For \nexample, while the regulation requires no mathematical progression or format, the disclosures must be presented in \na way that does not obscure the relationship of the terms to each other. In addition, although no minimum type size \nis mandated, the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.\n\n2. Segregation of disclosures. The disclosures may be grouped together and segregated from other information in a \nvariety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may be set off from \nother information on the contract or other documents:\n\n[.]i. By outlining them in a box\n\n[.]ii. By bold print dividing lines\n\n[.]iii. By a different color background\n\n[.]iv. By a different type style\n\n[(The general segregation requirement described in this subparagraph does not apply to the disclosures required \nunder \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b) and 226.20(c) although the disclosures must be clear and conspicuous.)]\n\n3. Location. The regulation imposes no specific location requirements on the segregated disclosures. For example:\n\n[.]i. They may appear on a disclosure statement separate from all other material.\n\n[.]ii. They may be placed on the same document with the credit contract or other information, so long as they are \nsegregated from that information.\n\n[.]iii. They may be shown on the front or back of a document.\n\n[.]iv. They need not begin at the top of a page.\n\n[.]v. They may be continued from one page to another.\n\n4. Content of segregated disclosures. Footnotes 37 and 38 contain exceptions to the requirement that the \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.18 be segregated from material that is not directly related to those disclosures. Footnote 37 \nlists the items that may be added to the segregated disclosures, even though not directly related to those \ndisclosures. Footnote 38 lists the items required under \u00a7 226.18 that may be deleted from the segregated \ndisclosures and appear elsewhere. Any one or more of these additions or deletions may be combined and appear \neither together with or separate from the segregated disclosures. The itemization of the amount financed under \u00a7 \n226.18(c), however, must be separate from the other segregated disclosures under \u00a7 226.18. If a creditor chooses \nto include the security interest charges required to be itemized under \u00a7 226.4(e) and \u00a7 226.18(o) in the amount \nfinanced itemization, it need not list these charges elsewhere.\n\n5. Directly Related. Except in a transaction secured by real property or a dwelling, t[T]he segregated disclosures \nmay, at the creditor's option, include any information that is directly related to those disclosures. (See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.37(a)(2) for a discussion of directly related information for transactions secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling.) The following is directly related information for a transaction not secured by real property or \na dwelling:\n\n\n\ni. A description of a grace period after which a late payment charge will be imposed. For example, the disclosure \ngiven under \u00a7 226.18(l) may state that a late charge will apply to \"any payment received more than 15 days after \nthe due date.\"\n\nii. A statement that the transaction is not secured. For example, the creditor may add a category labelled \n\"unsecured\" or \"not secured\" to the security interest disclosures given under \u00a7 226.18(m).\n\niii. The basis for any estimates used in making disclosures. For example, if the maturity date of a loan depends \nsolely on the occurrence of a future event, the creditor may indicate that the disclosures assume that event will \noccur at a certain time.\n\niv. The conditions under which a demand feature may be exercised. For example, in a loan subject to demand after \nfive years, the disclosures may state that the loan will become payable on demand in five years.\n\nv. An explanation of the use of pronouns or other references to the parties to the transaction. For example, the \ndisclosures may state, \"'You' refers to the customer and 'we' refers to the creditor.\"\n\nvi. Instructions to the creditor or its employees on the use of a multiple-purpose form. For example, the disclosures \nmay state, \"Check box if applicable.\"\n\nvii. A statement that the borrower may pay a minimum finance charge upon prepayment in a simple-interest \ntransaction. For example, when State law prohibits penalties, but would allow a minimum finance charge in the \nevent of prepayment, the creditor may make the \u00a7 226.18(k)(1) disclosure by stating, \"You may be charged a \nminimum finance charge.\"\n\nviii. A brief reference to negative amortization in variable-rate transactions. For example, in the variable-rate \ndisclosures, the creditor may include a short statement such as \"Unpaid interest will be added to principal.\" (See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.18(f)[(1)(iii)](3).)\n\nix. A brief caption identifying the disclosures. For example, the disclosures may bear a general title such as \n\"Federal Truth in Lending Disclosures\" or a descriptive title such as \"Real Estate Loan Disclosures.\"\n\nx. A statement that a due-on-sale clause or other conditions on assumption are contained in the loan document. For \nexample, the disclosure given under \u00a7 226.18(q) may state, \"Someone buying your home may, subject to \nconditions in the due-on-sale clause contained in the loan document, assume the remainder of the mortgage on the \noriginal terms.\"\n\nxi. If a State or Federal law prohibits prepayment penalties and excludes the charging of interest after prepayment \nfrom coverage as a penalty, a statement that the borrower may have to pay interest for some period after \nprepayment in full. The disclosure may state, for example, \"If you prepay your loan on other than the regular \ninstallment date, you may be assessed interest charges until the end of the month.\"\n\nxii. More than one hypothetical example under \u00a7 226.18(f)[(1)(iv)](4) in transactions with more than one variable-\nrate feature. For example, in a variable-rate transaction with an option permitting consumers to convert to a fixed-\nrate transaction, the disclosures may include an example illustrating the effects of an increase resulting from \nconversion in addition to the example illustrating an increase resulting from changes in the index.\n\nxiii. Reserved.[The disclosures set forth under section 226.18(f)(1) for variable-rate transactions subject to section \n226.18(f)(2).]\n\nxiv. [Reserved][A statement whether or not a subsequent purchase of the property securing an obligation may be \npermitted to assume the remaining obligation on its original terms.]\n\nxv. A late-payment fee disclosure under \u00a7 226.18(l) on a single payment loan.\n\n\n\nxvi. The notice set forth in [\u00a7 226.19(a)(4)]\u00a7 226.38(f)(1), in a closed-end transaction not subject to \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i). \nIn a mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 19(a)(1)(i), the creditor must disclose the notice contained in [\u00a7 \n226.19(a)(4)]\u00a7 226.38(f)(1) grouped together with the disclosures made under [\u00a7 226.18. See comment 19(a)(4)-\n1.]\u00a7 226.38.\n\n6. Multiple-purpose forms. Except for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, t[T]he creditor may design \na disclosure statement that can be used for more than one type of transaction, so long as the required disclosures \nfor individual transactions are clear and conspicuous. (See the Commentary to appendices G and H for a \ndiscussion of the treatment of disclosures that do not apply to specific transactions.) Any disclosure listed in \u00a7 \n226.18 (except the itemization of the amount financed under \u00a7 226.18(c)) may be included on a standard disclosure \nstatement even though not all of the creditor's transactions include those features. For example, the statement may \ninclude:\n\n[.]i. The variable rate disclosure under \u00a7 226.18(f).\n\n[.]ii. The demand feature disclosure under \u00a7 226.18(i).\n\n[.]iii. A reference to the possibility of a security interest arising from a spreader clause, under \u00a7 226.18(m).\n\n[. The assumption policy disclosure under \u00a7 226.18(q).]\n\n[.]iv. The required deposit disclosure under \u00a7 226.18(r).\n\n7. Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics. In certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer \nmay reduce the dollar amount of the payments to be made during the course of the transaction by agreeing to \nmake, at the end of the loan term, a large final payment based on the expected residual value of the property. The \nconsumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including, among other things, retaining \nthe property and making the final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the creditor \nin lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to \nRegulation M, but are considered credit transactions where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, \nincluding the risks, burdens and benefits of ownership upon consummation. These transactions are governed by \nthe disclosure requirements of this regulation instead of Regulation M. Creditors should not include in the \nsegregated Truth in Lending disclosures additional information. Thus, disclosures should show the large final \npayment in the payment schedule and should not, for example, reflect the other options available to the consumer \nat maturity. For extensions of credit secured by real property or a dwelling, the large final payment in the payment \nschedule should be disclosed in accordance with the requirements under section 226.38(c), as applicable.\n\nParagraph 17(a)(2).\n\n1. When disclosures must be more conspicuous. The following rules apply to the requirement that the terms annual \npercentage rate and finance charge be shown more conspicuously:\n\n[.]i. The terms must be more conspicuous only in relation to the other required disclosures under \u00a7 226.18. For \nexample, when the disclosures are included on the contract document, those 2 terms need not be more \nconspicuous as compared to the heading on the contract document or information required by State law.\n\n[.]ii. The terms need not be more conspicuous except as part of the finance charge and annual percentage rate \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.18(d) and (e), although they may, at the creditor's option, be highlighted wherever used in \nthe required disclosures. For example, the terms may, but need not, be highlighted when used in disclosing a \nprepayment penalty under \u00a7 226.18(k) or a required deposit under \u00a7 226.18(r).\n\n[.]iii. The creditor's identity under \u00a7 226.18(a) may, but need not, be more prominently displayed than the finance \ncharge and annual percentage rate.\n\n\n\n[.]iv. The terms need not be more conspicuous than figures (including, for example, numbers, percentages, and \ndollar signs)\n\n2. Making disclosures more conspicuous. The terms finance charge and annual percentage rate may be made \nmore conspicuous in any way that highlights them in relation to the other required disclosures. For example, they \nmay be:\n\n[.]i. Capitalized when other disclosures are printed in capital and lower case.\n\n[.]ii. Printed in larger type, bold print or different type face.\n\n[.]iii. Printed in a contrasting color.\n\n[.]iv. Underlined. [.]flv.fi Set off with asterisks.\n\n17(b) Time of disclosures.\n\n1. Consummation. As a general rule, disclosures must be made before \"consummation\" of the transaction. The \ndisclosures for transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling need not be given by any particular time \nbefore consummation[, except in certain mortgage transactions and variable-rate transactions secured by the \nconsumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year under \u00a7 226.19.] Pre-consummation disclosures for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling must be provided in accordance with the timing requirements in \n\u00a7 226.19. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.2(a)(13) regarding the definition of consummation.)\n\n2. Converting open-end to closed-end credit. Except for home equity plans subject to \u00a7 226.5b in which the \nagreement provides for a repayment phase, if an open-end credit account is converted to a closed-end transaction \nunder a written agreement with the consumer, the creditor must provide a set of closed-end credit disclosures \nbefore consummation of the closed-end transaction. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.19(a) for a discussion of \ndisclosure timing requirements for closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.19(b) for the timing rules for additional disclosures required upon the conversion to [a \nvariable-rate transaction secured by a consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year]an \nadjustable-rate transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.) If consummation of the closed-end transaction \noccurs at the same time as the consumer enters into the open-end agreement, the closed-end credit disclosures \nmay be given at the time of conversion. If disclosures are delayed until conversion and the closed-end transaction \nhas a variable-rate feature, disclosures should be based on the rate in effect at the time of conversion. (See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.5 regarding conversion of closed-end to open-end credit.)\n\n3. Disclosures provided on credit contracts. Creditors must give the required disclosures to the consumer in writing, \nin a form that the consumer may keep, before consummation of the transaction. See \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) and (b). \nSometimes the disclosures are placed on the same document with the credit contract. Creditors are not required to \ngive the consumer two separate copies of the document before consummation, one for the consumer to keep and a \nsecond copy for the consumer to execute. The disclosure requirement is satisfied if the creditor gives a copy of the \ndocument containing the unexecuted credit contract and disclosures to the consumer to read and sign; and the \nconsumer receives a copy to keep at the time the consumer becomes obligated. It is not sufficient for the creditor \nmerely to show the consumer the document containing the disclosures before the consumer signs and becomes \nobligated. The consumer must be free to take possession of and review the document in its entirety before signing.\n\ni. Example. To illustrate:\n\nA. A creditor gives a consumer a multiple-copy form containing a credit agreement and TILA disclosures. The \nconsumer reviews and signs the form and returns it to the creditor, who separates the copies and gives one copy to \nthe consumer to keep. The creditor has satisfied the disclosure requirement.\n\n17(c) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates.\n\n\n\n[Paragraph ]17(c)(1)Legal obligation.\n\n1. [Legal obligation.]General. The disclosures shall reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound as \nof the outset of the transaction. In the case of disclosures required under \u00a7 226.20(c), the disclosures shall reflect \nthe credit terms to which the parties are legally bound when the disclosures are provided. The legal obligation is \ndetermined by applicable State law or other law. The disclosures should be based on the assumption that the \nconsumer will abide by the terms of the legal obligation throughout the term of the transaction. For example, the \ndisclosures should be based on the assumption that the consumer makes payments on time and in full. In the case \nof an adjustable-rate mortgage described in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i)(A), the creditor shall make the disclosure required by \n\u00a7 226.38(c) based on the assumption that the interest rate increases as fast as it can, taking into account any \nlimitations on increases under the legal obligation. (Certain transactions are specifically addressed in this \ncommentary. See, for example, the discussion of buydown transactions elsewhere in the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.17(c).)\n\n[.]i. The fact that a term or contract may later be deemed unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or other \ngrounds does not, by itself, mean that disclosures based on that term or contract did not reflect the legal obligation.\n\n2. Modification of obligation. The legal obligation normally is presumed to be contained in the note or contract that \nevidences the agreement. But this presumption is rebutted if another agreement between the parties legally \nmodifies that note or contract. If the parties informally agree to a modification of the legal obligation, the modification \nshould not be reflected in the disclosures unless it rises to the level of a change in the terms of the legal obligation. \nFor example:\n\n[.]i. If the creditor offers a preferential rate, such as an employee preferred rate, the disclosures should reflect the \nterms of the legal obligation, subject to special disclosure rules for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3) and (c). [(See the commentary to \u00a7 226.19(b) for an example of a preferred-rate \ntransaction that is a variable-rate transaction.)]\n\n[.]ii. If the contract provides for a certain monthly payment schedule but payments are made on a voluntary payroll \ndeduction plan or an informal principal-reduction agreement, the disclosures should reflect the schedule in the \ncontract.\n\n[.]iii. If the contract provides for regular monthly payments but the creditor informally permits the consumer to defer \npayments from time to time, for instance, to take account of holiday seasons or seasonal employment, the \ndisclosures should reflect the regular monthly payments.\n\n3. Number of transactions. Creditors have flexibility in handling credit extensions that may be viewed as multiple \ntransactions. For example:\n\ni. When a creditor finances the credit sale of a radio and a television on the same day, the creditor may disclose the \nsales as either 1 or 2 credit sale transactions.\n\nii. When a creditor finances a loan along with a credit sale of health insurance, the creditor may disclose in one of \nseveral ways: a single credit sale transaction, a single loan transaction, or a loan and a credit sale transaction.\n\niii. The separate financing of a downpayment in a credit sale transaction may, but need not, be disclosed as 2 \ntransactions (a credit sale and a separate transaction for the financing of the downpayment).\n\n[3. Third-party buydown.] 17(c)(1)(i) Buydowns.\n\n1. Third-party buydown. In certain transactions, a seller or other third party may pay an amount, either to the \ncreditor or to the consumer, in order to reduce the consumer's payments or buy down the interest rate for all or a \nportion of the credit term. For example, a consumer and a bank agree to a mortgage with an interest rate of 15% \nand level payments over 25 years. By a separate agreement, the seller of the property agrees to subsidize the \n\n\n\nconsumer's payments for the first 2 years of the mortgage, giving the consumer an effective rate of 12% for that \nperiod.\n\n[.]i. If the lower rate is reflected in the credit contract between the consumer and the bank, the disclosures must take \nthe buydown into account. For example, the annual percentage rate must be a composite rate that takes account of \nboth the lower initial rate and the higher subsequent rate, and if the loan is not secured by real property or a \ndwelling, the payment schedule disclosures must reflect the 2 payment levels. However, the amount paid by the \nseller would not be specifically reflected in the disclosures given by the bank, since that amount constitutes seller's \npoints and thus is not part of the finance charge.\n\n[.]ii. If the lower rate is not reflected in the credit contract between the consumer and the bank and the consumer is \nlegally bound to the 15% rate from the outset, the disclosures given by the bank must not reflect the seller buydown \nin any way. For example, the annual percentage rate and, in a transaction not secured by real property, the \npayment schedule, would not take into account the reduction in the interest rate and payment level for the first 2 \nyears resulting from the buydown.\n\n[4.]2. Consumer buydowns. In certain transactions, the consumer may pay an amount to the creditor to reduce the \npayments or obtain a lower interest rate on the transaction. Consumer buydowns must be reflected in the \ndisclosures given for that transaction. To illustrate, in a mortgage transaction, the creditor and consumer agree to a \nnote specifying a 14 percent interest rate. However, in a separate document, the consumer agrees to pay an \namount to the creditor at consummation in return for a reduction in the interest rate to 12 percent for a portion of the \nmortgage term. The amount paid by the consumer may be deposited in an escrow account or may be retained by \nthe creditor. Depending upon the buydown plan, the consumer's prepayment of the obligation may or may not result \nin a portion of the amount being credited or refunded to the consumer. In the disclosures given for the mortgage, \nthe creditor must reflect the terms of the buydown agreement. For example:\n\n[.]i. The amount paid by the consumer is a prepaid finance charge [(], even if deposited in an escrow account[)]. (In \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling, \"finance charges\" are referred to as \"interest and settlement \ncharges\" under \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii).)\n\n[.]ii. A composite annual percentage rate must be calculated, taking into account both interest rates, as well as the \neffect of the prepaid finance charge.\n\n[.]iii. The payment schedule must reflect the multiple payment levels resulting from a buydown, in a transaction not \nsecured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n3. Lender buydown. The rules regarding consumer buydowns do not apply to transactions known as \"lender \nbuydowns.\" In lender buydowns. a creditor pays an amount (either into an account or to the party to whom the \nobligation is sold) to reduce the consumer's payments or interest rate for all or a portion of the credit term. Typically, \nthese transactions are structured as a buydown of the interest rate during an initial period of the transaction with a \nhigher than usual rate for the remainder of the term. The disclosures for lender buydowns should be based on the \nterms of the legal obligation between the consumer and the creditor. See comment [17(c)(1)-3] 17(c)(1)(i)-1 for the \nanalogous rules concerning third-party buydowns.\n\n[5.]4. Split buydowns. In certain transactions, a third party (such as a seller) and a consumer both pay an amount to \nthe creditor to reduce the interest rate. The creditor must include the portion paid by the consumer in the finance \ncharge and disclose the corresponding multiple payment levels and composite annual percentage rate. The portion \npaid by the third party and the corresponding reduction in interest rate, however, should not be reflected in the \ndisclosures unless the lower rate is reflected in the credit contract. See the discussion on third-party and consumer \nbuydown transactions [elsewhere in the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)] in comments 17(c)(1)(i)-1 and 17(c)(1)(i)-2, \nrespectively.\n\n17(c)(1)(ii) Wrap-around financing.\n\n\n\n[6. Wraparound financing.] 1. General. Wrap-around transactions, usually loans, involve the creditor's wrapping the \noutstanding balance on an existing loan and advancing additional funds to the consumer. The pre-existing loan, \nwhich is wrapped, may be to the same consumer or to a different consumer. In either case, the consumer makes a \nsingle payment to the new creditor, whom makes the payments on the pre-existing loan to the original creditor. \nWrap-around loans or sales are considered new single-advance transactions, with an amount financed equaling the \nsum of the new funds advanced by the wrap creditor and the remaining principal owed to the original creditor on the \npre-existing loan. In disclosing the itemization of the amount financed, the creditor may use a label such as \"the \namount that will be paid to creditor X\" to describe the remaining principal balance on the pre-existing loan. This \napproach to Truth in Lending calculations has no effect on calculations required by other statutes, such as State \nusury laws.\n\n[7.]2. Wrap-around financing with balloon payments. For wrap-around transactions involving a large final payment \nof the new funds before the maturity of the pre-existing loan, the amount financed is the sum of the new funds and \nthe remaining principal on the pre-existing loan. The disclosures should be based on the shorter term of the wrap \nloan, with a large final payment of both the new funds and the total remaining principal on the pre-existing loan \n(although only the wrap loan will actually be paid off at that time).\n\n17(c)(1)(iii) Variable-or adjustable-rate transactions.\n\n[8.]1. Basis of disclosures [in variable-rate transactions]. The disclosures for a variable-or adjustable-rate \ntransaction must be given for the full term of the transaction and must be based on the terms in effect at the time of \nconsummation. Creditors generally should base the disclosures only on the initial rate and should not assume that \nthis rate will increase (except as provided in \u00a7 226.38(c) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling). For \nexample, in a a variable-or adjustable-rate loan with an initial interest rate of 10 percent and a 5 percentage points \nrate cap, creditors should base the disclosures on the initial rate and should not assume that the rate will increase 5 \npercentage points. However, in a variable-rate transaction with a seller buydown that is reflected in the credit \ncontract, a consumer buydown, or a discounted or premium rate, disclosures should be a composite rate based on \nthe rate in effect during the initial period and the rate that is the basis of the variable-rate feature for the remainder \nof the term. (See the commentary to section 226.17(c)(1) for a discussion of buydown, discounted, and premium \ntransactions and the commentary to section 226.19(a)(2) for a discussion of [the] redisclosure in [certain mortgage \ntransactions with a variable-rate] transactions secured by real property or a dwelling with an adjustable-rate feature.\n\n[9.]2. Use of estimates in variable-or adjustable-rate transactions. The variable-or adjustable-rate feature does not, \nby itself, make the disclosures estimates.\n\n[10.]3. Discounted and premium variable-or adjustable-rate transactions. In some variable-or adjustable-rate \ntransactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make \nlater interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate charged to consumers is lower than the rate would be if it \nwere calculated using the index or formula. However, in some cases the initial rate may be higher. In a discounted \ntransaction, for example, a creditor may calculate interest rates according to a formula using the six-month Treasury \nbill rate plus a 2 percent margin. If the Treasury bill rate at consummation is 10 percent, the creditor may forgo the 2 \npercent spread and charge only 10 percent for a limited time, instead of setting an initial rate of 12 percent.\n\ni. When creditors use an initial interest rate that is not calculated using the index or formula for later rate \nadjustments, the disclosures should reflect a composite annual percentage rate based on the initial rate for as long \nas it is charged and, for the remainder of the term, the rate that would have been applied using the index or formula \nat the time of consummation. The interest rate at consummation need not be used if a contract provides for a delay \nin the implementation of changes in an index value. For example, if the contract specifies that interest rate changes \nare based on the index value in effect 45 days before the interest rate change date, creditors may use any index \nvalue in effect during the 45-day period before consummation in calculating a composite annual percentage rate.\n\nii. The effect of the multiple rates must also be reflected in the calculation and disclosure of the finance charge, total \nof payments, and payment schedule. (In transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, creditors disclose the \n\n\n\n\"interest and settlement charges\" rather than the \"finance charge\" and the \"payment summary\" rather than the \n\"payment schedule.\" See \u00a7 226.38(c) and (e)(5).\n\niii. If a loan contains a rate or payment cap that would prevent the initial rate or payment, at the time of the first \nadjustment, from changing to the rate determined by the index or formula at consummation, the effect of that rate or \npayment cap should be reflected in the disclosures.\n\niv. Because these transactions involve irregular payment amounts, an annual percentage rate tolerance of <14>; of \n1 percent applies, in accordance with \u00a7 226.22(a)(3).\n\nv. Examples of discounted [variable] adjustable-rate transactions secured by real property or a dwelling include:\n\nA. A 30-year loan for $ 100,000 with no prepaid [finance charges] interest and settlement charges and rates \ndetermined by the Treasury bill rate plus 2 percent. Rate and payment adjustments are made annually. Although \nthe Treasury bill rate at the time of consummation is 10 percent, the creditor sets the interest rate for one year at 9 \npercent, instead of 12 percent according to the formula. The disclosures should reflect a composite annual \npercentage rate of 11.63 percent based on 9 percent for one year and 12 percent for 29 years. [Reflecting those \ntwo rate levels, the payment schedule should show 12 payments of $ 804.62 and 348 payments of $ 1,025.31.] \nThe [finance charge] interest and settlement charges should be $ 266,463.32 and the total of payments $ \n366,463.32.\n\nB. Same loan as above, except with a 2 percent rate cap on periodic adjustments. The disclosures should reflect a \ncomposite annual percentage rate of 11.53 percent based on 9 percent for the first year, 11 percent for the second \nyear, and 12 percent for the remaining 28 years. [Reflecting those three rate levels, the payment schedule should \nshow 12 payments of $ 804.62, 12 payments of $ 950,09, and 336 payments of $ 365,234.76.] The [finance \ncharge] interest and settlement charges should be $ 265,234.76 and the total of payments should be $ 365,234.76.\n\nC. Same loan as above, except with a 7 1/2; percent cap on payment adjustments. The disclosures should reflect a \ncomposite annual percentage rate of 11.64 percent, based on 9 percent for one year and 12 percent for 29 years. \n[Because of the payment cap, five levels of payments should be reflected.] The [finance charge] interest and \nsettlement charges should be $ 277,040.60, and the total of payments $ 377,040.60.\n\nvi. A loan in which the initial interest rate is set according to the index or formula used for later adjustments but is \nnot set at the value of the index or formula at consummation is not a discounted or premium variable-or adjustable-\nrate loan. For example, if a creditor commits to an initial rate based on the formula on a date prior to consummation, \nbut the index has moved during the period between that time and consummation, a creditor should base its \ndisclosures on the initial rate.\n\n[11. Examples of variable-rate transactions.] 4. General. In general, v [V]ariable-rate transactions include:\n\n[.]i. Renewable balloon-payment instruments with a fixed interest rate where the creditor is both unconditionally \nobligated to renew the balloon-payment loan at the consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions \nwithin the consumer's control) and has the option of increasing the interest rate at the time of renewal. (However, a \ntransaction secured by real property or a dwelling with a balloon payment and a fixed interest rate must be \ndisclosed as a fixed-rate transaction under \u00a7 226.38(a)(3) whether or not the transaction is renewable.) Disclosures \nmust be based on the payment amortization (unless the specified term of the obligation with renewals is shorter) \nand on the rate in effect at the time of consummation of the transaction. (Examples of conditions within a \nconsumer's control include requirements that a consumer be current in payments or continue to reside in the \nmortgaged property. In contrast, setting a limit on the rate at which the creditor would be obligated to renew or \nreserving the right to change the credit standards at the time of renewal are examples of conditions outside a \nconsumer's control.) If, however, a creditor is not obligated to renew as described above, disclosures must be \nbased on the term of the balloon-payment loan. Disclosures also must be based on the term of the balloon-payment \nloan in balloon-payment instruments in which the legal obligation provides that the loan will be renewed by a \n\"refinancing\" of the obligation, as that term is defined by \u00a7 226.20(a). If it cannot be determined from the legal \n\n\n\nobligation that the loan will be renewed by a \"refinancing,\" disclosures must be based either on the term of the \nballoon-payment loan or on the payment amortization, depending on whether the creditor is unconditionally \nobligated to renew the loan as described above. (This discussion does not apply to construction loans subject to \u00a7 \n226.17(c)(6).)\n\n[. \"Shared-equity\" or \"shared-appreciation\" mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest and an appreciation share \nbased on the consumer's equity in the mortgaged property, in a transaction not secured by real property or a \ndwelling. The appreciation share is payable in a lump sum at a specified time. Disclosures must be based on the \nfixed interest rate. (As discussed in the commentary to \u00a7 226.2, other types of shared-equity arrangements are not \nconsidered \"credit\" and are not subject to Regulation Z.)]\n\n[.]ii. Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but \nwill increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the creditor, and the \nnote reflects the preferred rate. The disclosures are to be based on the preferred rate.\n\n[. Graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without a variable-rate feature are not considered \nvariable-rate transactions. \"Shared-equity\" or \"shared-appreciation\" mortgages are not considered variable-rate \ntransactions.]\n\n[.]iii. \"Price level adjusted mortgages\" or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for \nperiodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation. \nDisclosures are to be based on the fixed interest rate.\n\n5. Not variable-or adjustable-rate transactions. Graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without a \nvariable-rate feature are not considered variable-or adjustable-rate transactions.\n\n[12.]6. Graduated-payment adjustable-rate mortgage. Graduated payment adjustable rate mortgages involve both \n[a variable] an adjustable interest rate and scheduled [variations] adjustments in payment amounts during the loan \nterm. For example, under these plans, a series of graduated payments may be scheduled before rate adjustments \naffect payment amounts, or the initial scheduled payment may remain constant for a set period before rate \nadjustments affect the payment amount. In any case, the initial payment amount may be insufficient to cover the \nscheduled interest, causing negative amortization from the outset of the transaction. In these transactions, the \ndisclosures should treat these features as follows:\n\n[.]i. The finance charge includes the amount of negative amortization based on the assumption that the rate in effect \nat consummation remains unchanged.\n\n[.]ii. The amount financed does not include the amount of negative amortization.\n\n[.]iii. As in any variable-or adjustable-rate transaction, the annual percentage rate is based on the terms in effect at \nconsummation.\n\n[. The schedule of payments discloses the amount of any scheduled initial payments followed by an adjusted level \nof payments based on the initial interest rate. Since some mortgage plans contain limits on the amount of the \npayment adjustment, the payment schedule in a transaction not secured by real property or a dwelling, or payment \nsummary, in a transaction secured by real property or a dwelling may require several different levels of payments, \neven with the assumption that the original interest rate does not increase.]\n\n[13.]7. Growth-equity mortgages. Growth-equity mortgages, a [A]lso referred to as payment-escalated mortgages, \n[these mortgage plans involve] scheduled payment increases to prematurely amortize the loan. The initial payment \namount is determined as for a long-term loan with a fixed interest rate. Payment increases are scheduled \nperiodically, based on changes in an index. The larger payments result in accelerated amortization of the loan. In \ndisclosing these mortgage plans, creditors [may either--\n\n. Estimate] must estimate the amount of payment increases, based on the best information reasonably available[, or\n\n\n\n. Disclose by analogy to the variable-rate disclosures in section 226.18(f)(1)]. (This discussion does not apply to \ngrowth-equity mortgages in which the amount of payment increases can be accurately determined at the time of \ndisclosure. For these mortgages, [as for graduated-payment mortgages,] disclosures should reflect the scheduled \nincreases in payments.)\n\n[14. Reverse mortgages.] 17(c)(1)(iv) Repayment upon occurrence of future event.\n\n1. General. Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse annuity or home equity conversion mortgages, typically \ninvolve the disbursement of monthly advances to the consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrence of an event \nsuch as the consumer's death. Repayment of the loan (generally a single payment of principal and accrued interest) \nmay be required to be made at the end of the disbursements or, for example, upon the death of the consumer. \n(However, a reverse mortgage is covered by \u00a7 226.33 only if the consumer's death is one of the conditions of \nrepayment, as provided under \u00a7 226.33(a).) In disclosing these transactions, creditors must apply the following \nrules, as applicable:\n\n[.]i. If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for disbursements but repayment is due only upon the \noccurrence of a future event such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that disbursements will \nbe made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor must assume repayment will occur when disbursements end \n(or within a period following the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval between \ndisbursements). This assumption should be used even though repayment may occur before or after the \ndisbursements are scheduled to end. In such cases, the creditor may include a statement such as \"The disclosures \nassume that you will repay the loan at the time our payments to you end. As provided in your agreement, your \nrepayment may be required at a different time.\"\n\n[.]ii. If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period for disbursements nor a specified repayment date and \nthese terms will be determined solely by reference to future events including the consumer's death, the creditor may \nassume that the disbursements will end upon the consumer's death (estimated by using actuarial tables, for \nexample) and that repayment will be required at the same time (or within a period following the date of the final \ndisbursement which is not longer than the regular interval for disbursements). Alternatively, the creditor may base \nthe disclosures upon another future event it estimates will be most likely to occur first. (If terms will be determined \nby reference to future events which do not include the consumer's death, the creditor must base the disclosures \nupon the occurrence of the event estimated to be most likely to occur first.)\n\n[.]iii. In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume that all disbursements and accrued interest will be paid by \nthe consumer. For example, if the note has a nonrecourse provision providing that the consumer is not obligated for \nan amount greater than the value of the house, the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full amount to be \ndisbursed will be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may include a statement such as \"The disclosures \nassume full repayment of the amount advanced plus accrued interest, although the amount you may be required to \npay is limited by your agreement.\"\n\n[.]iv. Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property will be shared \nbetween the consumer and the creditor. [Such loans are considered variable-rate mortgages, as described in \ncomment 17(c)(1)-11, and the appreciation feature must be disclosed in accordance with \u00a7 226.18(f)(1). If the \nreverse mortgage has a variable interest rate, is written for a term greater than one year, and is secured by the \nconsumer's principal dwelling, the shared appreciation feature must be described under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(vii).] If the \nreverse mortgage has an adjustable interest rate and is secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor must \ndisclose the shared-equity or shared-appreciation feature as required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(3)(iii) and 226.38(d)(2)(iii).\n\n[15. Morris Plan transactions. When a deposit account is created for the sole purpose of accumulating payments \nand then is applied to satisfy entirely the consumer's obligation in the transaction, each deposit made into the \naccount is considered the same as a payment on a loan for purposes of making disclosures.\n\n16. Number of transactions. Creditors have flexibility in handling credit extensions that may be viewed as multiple \ntransactions. For example:\n\n\n\n. When a creditor finances the credit sale of a radio and a television on the same day, the creditor may disclose the \nsales as either 1 or 2 credit sale transactions.\n\n. When a creditor finances a loan along with a credit sale of health insurance, the creditor may disclose in one of \nseveral ways: a single credit sale transaction, a single loan transaction, or a loan and a credit sale transaction.\n\n. The separate financing of a downpayment in a credit sale transaction may, but need not, be disclosed as 2 \ntransactions (a credit sale and a separate transaction for the financing of the downpayment).]\n\n[17. Special rules for tax refund anticipation loans.] 17(c)(1)(v) Tax refund-anticipation loan.\n\n1. General. Tax refund loans, also known as refund anticipation loans (RALs), are transactions in which a creditor \nwill lend up to the amount of a consumer's expected tax refund. RAL agreements typically require repayment upon \ndemand, but also may provide that repayment is required when the refund is made. The agreements also typically \nprovide that if the amount of the refund is less than the payment due, the consumer must pay the difference. \nRepayment often is made by a preauthorized offset to a consumer's account held with the creditor when the refund \nhas been deposited by electronic transfer. Creditors may charge fees for RALs in addition to fees for filing the \nconsumer's tax return electronically. In RAL transactions subject to the regulation the following special rules apply:\n\n[.]i. If, under the terms of the legal obligation, repayment of the loan is required when the refund is received by the \nconsumer (such as by deposit into the consumer's account), the disclosures should be based on the creditor's \nestimate of the time the refund will be delivered even if the loan also contains a demand clause. The practice of a \ncreditor to demand repayment upon delivery of refunds does not determine whether the legal obligation requires \nthat repayment be made at that time; this determination must be made according to applicable State or other law. \n(See comment 17(c)(5)-1 for the rules regarding disclosures if the loan is payable solely on demand or is payable \neither on demand or on an alternate maturity date.)\n\n[.]ii. If the consumer is required to repay more than the amount borrowed, the difference is a finance charge unless \nexcluded under \u00a7 226.4. In addition, to the extent that any fees charged in connection with the loan (such as for \nfiling the tax return electronically) exceed those fees for a comparable cash transaction (that is, filing the tax return \nelectronically without a loan), the difference must be included in the finance charge.\n\n[18.] 17(c)(1)(vi) Pawn transactions.\n\n1. General. When, in connection with an extension of credit, a consumer pledges or sells an item to a pawnbroker \ncreditor in return for a sum of money and retains the right to redeem the item for a greater sum (the redemption \nprice) within a specified period of time, disclosures are required. In addition to other disclosure requirements that \nmay be applicable under \u00a7 226.18, for purposes of pawn transactions:\n\ni. The amount financed is the initial sum paid to the consumer. The pawnbroker creditor need not provide a \nseparate itemization of the amount financed if that entire amount is paid directly to the consumer and the disclosed \ndescription of the amount financed is \"the amount of cash given directly to you\" or a similar phrase.\n\nii. The finance charge is the difference between the initial sum paid to the consumer and the redemption price plus \nany other finance charges paid in connection with the transaction. (See \u00a7 226.4.)\n\niii. The term of the transaction, for calculating the annual percentage rate, is the period of time agreed to by the \npawnbroker creditor and the consumer. The term of the transaction does not include a grace period (including any \nstatutory grace period) after the agreed redemption date.\n\nParagraph 17(c)(2)(i).\n\n1. Basis for estimates. Disclosures may be estimated when the exact information is unknown at the time disclosures \nare made, except that creditors may not provide estimated disclosures in disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) \nand (iii). Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are made. \n\n\n\nThe \"reasonably available\" standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in \nobtaining information. For example, the creditor must at a minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but \nneed not invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation. The creditor \nnormally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might \nlook to the consumer for the time of consummation, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to realtors \nfor taxes and escrow fees. The creditor may utilize estimates in making disclosures even though the creditor knows \nthat more precise information will be available by the point of consummation. However, new disclosures may be \nrequired under \u00a7 226.17(f) or \u00a7 226.19.\n\n2. Labelling estimates. Estimates must be designated as such in the segregated disclosures, except that creditors \nmay not provide estimated disclosures in the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) and (iii). Even though other \ndisclosures are based on the same assumption on which a specific estimated disclosure was based, the creditor \nhas some flexibility in labelling the estimates. Generally, only the particular disclosure for which the exact \ninformation is unknown is labelled as an estimate. However, when several disclosures are affected because of the \nunknown information, the creditor has the option of labelling either every affected disclosure or only the disclosure \nprimarily affected. For example, when the finance charge is unknown because the date of consummation is \nunknown, the creditor must label the finance charge as an estimate and may also label as estimates the total of \npayments and the payment schedule. When many numerical disclosures are estimates, the creditor may use a \ngeneral statement, such as \"all numerical disclosures except the late payment disclosure are estimates,\" as a \nmethod to label those disclosures as estimates.\n\n3. Simple-interest transactions. If consumers do not make timely payments in a simple-interest transaction, some of \nthe amounts calculated for Truth in Lending disclosures will differ from amounts that consumers will actually pay \nover the term of the transaction. Creditors may label disclosures as estimates in these transactions[.] except as \notherwise provided by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). (See the commentary on \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) for a discussion of circumstances \nwhere creditors may not disclose estimates for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.) For example, \nbecause the finance charge and total of payments may be larger than disclosed if consumers make late payments, \ncreditors may label the finance charge and total of payments as estimates. On the other hand, creditors may \nchoose not to label disclosures as estimates. In all cases, creditors [and] may base [all] disclosures on the \nassumption that payments will be made on time and in the amounts required by the terms of the legal obligation, \ndisregarding any possible [inaccuracies] differences resulting from consumers' payment patterns.\n\nParagraph 17(c)(2)(ii)\n\n1. Per diem interest. This paragraph applies to any numerical amount (such as the finance charge, annual \npercentage rate, or payment amount) that is affected by the amount of the per-diem interest charge that will be \ncollected at consummation. If the amount of per-diem interest used in preparing the disclosures for consummation \nis based on the information known to the creditor at the time the disclosure document is prepared, the disclosures \nare considered accurate under this rule, and affected disclosures are also considered accurate, even if the \ndisclosures are not labeled as estimates. For example, if the amount of per-diem interest used to prepare \ndisclosures is less than the amount of per-diem interest charged at consummation, and as a result the finance \ncharge is understated by $ 200, the disclosed finance charge is considered accurate even though the \nunderstatement is not within the $ 100 tolerance of \u00a7 226.18(d)(1), and the finance charge was not labeled as an \nestimate. In this example, if in addition to the understatement related to the per-diem interest, a $ 90 fee is \nincorrectly omitted from the finance charge, causing it to be understated by a total of $ 290, the finance charge is \nconsidered accurate because the $ 90 fee is within the tolerance in \u00a7 226.18(d)(1).\n\nParagraph 17(c)(3)\n\n1. Minor variations. Section 226.17(c)(3) allows creditors to disregard certain factors in calculating and making \ndisclosures. For example:\n\n\n\n[.]i. Creditors may ignore the effects of collecting payments in whole cents. Because payments cannot be collected \nin fractional cents, it is often difficult to amortize exactly an obligation with equal payments; the amount of the last \npayment may require adjustment to account for the rounding of the other payments to whole cents.\n\n[.]ii. Creditors may base their disclosures on calculation tools that assume that all months have an equal number of \ndays, even if their practice is to take account of the variations in months for purposes of collecting interest. For \nexample, a creditor may use a calculation tool based on a 360-day year, when it in fact collects interest by applying \na factor of 1/365 of the annual rate to 365 days. This rule does not, however, authorize creditors to ignore, for \ndisclosure purposes, the effects of applying 1/360 of an annual rate to 365 days.\n\n2. Use of special rules. A creditor may utilize the special rules in \u00a7 226.17(c)(3) for purposes of calculating and \nmaking all disclosures for a transaction or may, at its option, use the special rules for some disclosures and not \nothers.\n\nParagraph 17(c)(4).\n\n1. Payment schedule irregularities. When one or more payments in a transaction differ from the others because of a \nlong or short first period, the variations may be ignored in disclosing the payment schedule, finance charge, annual \npercentage rate, and other terms. For example:\n\n[.]i. A 36-month auto loan might be consummated on June 8 with payments due on July 1 and the first of each \nsucceeding month. The creditor may base its calculations on a payment schedule that assumes 36 equal intervals \nand 36 equal installment payments, even though a precise computation would produce slightly different amounts \nbecause of the shorter first period.\n\n[.]ii. By contrast, in the same example, if the first payment were not scheduled until August 1, the irregular first \nperiod would exceed the limits in \u00a7 226.17(c)(4); the creditor could not use the special rule and could not ignore the \nextra days in the first period in calculating its disclosures.\n\n2. Measuring odd periods. In determining whether a transaction may take advantage of the rule in \u00a7 226.17(c)(4), \nthe creditor must measure the variation against a regular period. For purposes of that rule:\n\n[.]i. The first period is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the \nfirst payment.\n\n[.]ii. The term is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the final \npayment.\n\n[.]iii. The regular period is the most common interval between payments in the transaction. In transactions involving \nregular periods that are monthly, semimonthly or multiples of a month, the length of the irregular and regular \nperiods may be calculated on the basis of either the actual number of days or an assumed 30-day month. In other \ntransactions, the length of the periods is based on the actual number of days.\n\n3. Use of special rules. A creditor may utilize the special rules in \u00a7 226.17(c)(4) for purposes of calculating and \nmaking some disclosures but may elect not to do so for all of the disclosures. For example, the variations may be \nignored in calculating and disclosing the annual percentage rate but taken into account in calculating and disclosing \nthe finance charge and payment schedule.\n\n4. Relation to prepaid finance charges. Prepaid finance charges, including \"odd-days\" or \"per-diem\" interest, paid \nprior to or at closing may not be treated as the first payment on a loan. Thus, creditors may not disregard an \nirregularity in disclosing such finance charges.\n\nParagraph 17(c)(5).\n\n\n\n1. Demand disclosures. Disclosures for demand obligations are based on an assumed 1-year term, unless an \nalternate maturity date is stated in the legal obligation. Whether an alternate maturity date is stated in the legal \nobligation is determined by applicable law. An alternate maturity date is not inferred from an informal principal \nreduction agreement or a similar understanding between the parties. However, when the note itself specifies a \nprincipal reduction schedule (for example, \"payable on demand or $ 2,000 plus interest quarterly\"), an alternate \nmaturity is stated and the disclosures must reflect that date. See \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(D) and 226.38(d)(2)(iv) and \nassociated commentary to determine how to disclose a demand feature for a transaction secured by real property \nor a dwelling.\n\n2. Future event as maturity date. An obligation whose maturity date is determined solely by a future event, as for \nexample, a loan payable only on the sale of property, is not a demand obligation. Because no demand feature is \ncontained in the obligation, demand disclosures under \u00a7 226.18(i) are inapplicable. The disclosures should be \nbased on the creditor's estimate of the time at which the specified event will occur, and in a transaction not secured \nby real property or a dwelling may indicate the basis for the creditor's estimate, as noted in the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.17(a).\n\n3. Demand after stated period. Most demand transactions contain a demand feature that may be exercised at any \npoint during the term, but [certain transactions] a transaction may convert to demand status only after a fixed \nperiod. [For example, in States prohibiting due-on-sale clauses, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) \nrequires mortgages that it purchases to include a call option rider that may be exercised after 7 years. These \nmortgages are generally written as long-term obligations, but contain a demand feature that may be exercised only \nwithin a 30-day period at 7 years.] The disclosures for [these transactions] a transaction that converts to demand \nstatus after a fixed period should be based upon the legally agreed-upon maturity date. Thus, for example, if a \nmortgage containing [the 7-year FNMA call option] a call option the creditor may exercise during the first 30 days of \nthe eighth year after loan origination is written as a 20-year obligation, the disclosures should be based on the 20-\nyear term, with the demand feature disclosed under [\u00a7 226.18(i)] \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iv).\n\n4. Balloon mortgages. Balloon payment mortgages, with payments based on a long-term amortization schedule and \na large final payment due after a shorter term, are not demand obligations unless a demand feature is specifically \ncontained in the contract. For example, a mortgage with a term of 5 years and a payment [schedule] summary \nbased on 20 years would not be treated as a mortgage with a demand feature, in the absence of any contractual \ndemand provisions. [In this type of mortgage, disclosures should be based on the 5-year term.] (See \u00a7 226.38(c)(3) \nfor requirements for interest rate and payment summary disclosures for balloon payment mortgages.)\n\nParagraph 17(c)(6).\n\n1. Series of advances. Section 226.17(c)(6)(i) deals with a series of advances under an agreement to extend credit \nup to a certain amount. A creditor may treat all of the advances as a single transaction or disclose each advance as \na separate transaction. If these advances are treated as 1 transaction and the timing and amounts of advances are \nunknown, creditors must make disclosures based on estimates, as provided in \u00a7 226.17(c)(2). If the advances are \ndisclosed separately, disclosures must be provided before each advance occurs, with the disclosures for the first \nadvance provided by consummation.\n\n2. Construction loans. Section 226.17(c)(6)(ii) provides a flexible rule for disclosure of construction loans that may \nbe permanently financed. These transactions have 2 distinct phases, similar to 2 separate transactions. The \nconstruction loan may be for initial construction or subsequent construction, such as rehabilitation or remodelling. \nThe construction period usually involves several disbursements of funds at times and in amounts that are unknown \nat the beginning of that period, with the consumer paying only accrued interest until construction is completed. \nUnless the obligation is paid at that time, the loan then converts to permanent financing in which the loan amount is \namortized just as in a standard mortgage transaction. Section 226.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to give either one \ncombined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of \ndisclosures for the 2 phases. This rule is available whether the consumer is initially obligated to accept construction \nfinancing only or is obligated to accept both construction and permanent financing from the outset. If the consumer \n\n\n\nis obligated on both phases and the creditor chooses to give 2 sets of disclosures, both sets must be given to the \nconsumer initially, because both transactions would be consummated at that time. (Appendix D provides a method \nof calculating the annual percentage rate and other disclosures for construction loans, which may be used, at the \ncreditor's option, in disclosing construction financing.)\n\n3. Multiple-advance construction loans. Section 226.17(c)(6)(i) and (ii) are not mutually exclusive. For example, in a \ntransaction that finances the construction of a dwelling that may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the \nconstruction phase may consist of a series of advances under an agreement to extend credit up to a certain \namount. In these cases, the creditor may disclose the construction phase as either 1 or more than 1 transaction and \nalso disclose the permanent financing as a separate transaction.\n\n4. Residential mortgage transaction. See the commentary to \u00a7 226.2(a)(24) for a discussion of the effect of \u00a7 \n226.17(c)(6) on the definition of a residential mortgage transaction.\n\n5. Allocation of points. When a creditor utilizes the special rule in \u00a7 226.17(c)(6) to disclose credit extensions as \nmultiple transactions, buyers points or similar amounts imposed on the consumer must be allocated for purposes of \ncalculating disclosures. While such amounts should not be taken into account more than once in making \ncalculations, they may be allocated between the transactions in any manner the creditor chooses. For example, if a \nconstruction-permanent loan is subject to 5 points imposed on the consumer and the creditor chooses to disclose \nthe 2 phases separately, the 5 points may be allocated entirely to the construction loan, entirely to the permanent \nloan, or divided in any manner between the two. However, the entire 5 points may not be applied twice, that is, to \nboth the construction and the permanent phases.\n\n17(d) Multiple creditors; multiple consumers.\n\n1. Multiple creditors. If a credit transaction involves more than one creditor:\n\n[.]i. The creditors must choose which of them will make the disclosures.\n\n[.]ii. A single, complete set of disclosures must be provided, rather than partial disclosures from several creditors.\n\n[.]iii. All disclosures for the transaction must be given, even if the disclosing creditor would not otherwise have been \nobligated to make a particular disclosure. For example, if one of the creditors is the seller, the total sale price \ndisclosure under \u00a7 226.18(j) must be made, even though the disclosing creditor is not the seller.\n\n2. Multiple consumers. When two consumers are joint obligors with primary liability on an obligation, the disclosures \nmay be given to either one of them. If one consumer is merely a surety or guarantor, the disclosures must be given \nto the principal debtor. In rescindable transactions, however, separate disclosures must be given to each consumer \nwho has the right to rescind under \u00a7 226.23, although the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.19(b) need only be \nprovided to the consumer who expresses an interest in a variable-rate loan program.\n\n17(e) Effect of subsequent events.\n\n1. Events causing inaccuracies. Inaccuracies in disclosures are not violations if attributable to events occurring after \nthe disclosures are made. [For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the collateral \ninsured and the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make \nthe original disclosures inaccurate.] The creditor may, however, be required to make new disclosures under \u00a7 \n226.17(f) or \u00a7 226.19 if the events occurred between disclosure and consummation or under \u00a7 226.20 if the events \noccurred after consummation. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the \ncollateral insured and the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does \nnot make the original disclosures inaccurate. However, the creditor would be required to provide the notice required \nunder \u00a7 226.20(e).\n\n17(f) Early disclosures.\n\n\n\n1. Change in rate or other terms. Redisclosure is required for changes that occur between the time disclosures are \nmade and consummation if the annual percentage rate in the consummated transaction exceeds the limits \nprescribed in this section, even if the [initial] prior disclosures would be considered accurate under the tolerances in \n\u00a7 226.18(d) or \u00a7 226.22(a). To illustrate:\n\ni. [General.] Non-mortgage loan. A. If disclosures are made in a regular transaction not secured by real property or \na dwelling on July 1, the transaction is consummated on July 15, and the actual annual percentage rate varies by \nmore than 1/8 of 1 percentage point from the disclosed annual percentage rate, the creditor must either redisclose \nthe changed terms or furnish a complete set of new disclosures before consummation. Redisclosure is required \neven if the disclosures made on July 1 are based on estimates and marked as such.\n\nB. In a regular transaction not secured by real property or a dwelling, if early disclosures are marked as estimates \nand the disclosed annual percentage rate is within 1/8 of 1 percentage point of the rate at consummation, the \ncreditor need not redisclose the changed terms (including the annual percentage rate).\n\n[ii. Nonmortgage loan.] C. If disclosures for a transaction not secured by real property or a dwelling are made on \nJuly 1, the transaction is consummated on July 15, and the finance charge increased by $ 35 but the disclosed \nannual percentage rate is within the permitted tolerance, the creditor must at least redisclose the changed terms \nthat were not marked as estimates. (See \u00a7 226.18(d)(2) of this part.)\n\n[iii.]ii. Mortgage loan. At the time [TILA disclosures] the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) are prepared in \nJuly, the loan closing is scheduled for July 31 and the creditor does not plan to collect per-diem interest at \nconsummation. Consummation actually occurs on August 5, and per-diem interest for the remainder of August is \ncollected as a prepaid finance charge. [Assuming there were no other changes requiring redisclosure, t] The \ncreditor may rely on the disclosures prepared in July that were accurate when they were prepared. However, if the \ncreditor prepares new disclosures in August that will be provided at consummation, the new disclosures must take \ninto account the amount of the per-diem interest known to the creditor at that time.\n\n2. Variable or adjustable rate. The addition of a variable or adjustable rate feature to the credit terms, after early \ndisclosures are given, requires new disclosures. (See \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) to determine when new disclosures are \nrequired for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\n3. Content of new disclosures. Subject to \u00a7 226.19(a), i[I]f redisclosure is required in a transaction not secured by \nreal property or a dwelling, the creditor has the option of either providing a complete set of new disclosures, or \nproviding disclosures of only the terms that vary from those originally disclosed. If the creditor chooses to provide a \ncomplete set of new disclosures, the creditor may but need not highlight the new terms, provided that the \ndisclosures comply with the format requirements of \u00a7 226.17(a). If the creditor chooses to disclose only the new \nterms, all the new terms must be disclosed. For example, a different annual percentage rate will almost always \nproduce a different finance charge, and often a new schedule of payments; all of these changes would have to be \ndisclosed. If, in addition, unrelated terms such as the amount financed or prepayment penalty vary from those \noriginally disclosed, the accurate terms must be disclosed. However, no new disclosures are required if the only \ndifferences involve estimates other than the annual percentage rate, and no variable rate feature has been added \n(see comment 17(f)-2). If a transaction is secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor must provide a \ncomplete set of new disclosures in all cases, however. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.19(a)(2).)\n\n4. Special rules. [In mortgage transactions subject to \u00a7 226.19, the creditor must redisclose if, between the delivery \nof the required early disclosures and consummation, the annual percentage rate changes by more than a stated \ntolerance.] Special disclosure timing and content requirements apply under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) to disclosures provided \nbefore consummation for mortgage transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. When subsequent events \noccur after consummation, new disclosures are required only if there is a refinancing or an assumption within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 226.20.\n\nParagraph 17(f)(2).\n\n\n\n1. Irregular transactions. For purposes of this paragraph, a transaction is deemed to be \"irregular\" according to the \ndefinition in footnote 46 of \u00a7 226.22(a)(3).\n\n17(g) Mail or telephone orders--delay in disclosures.\n\n1. Conditions for use. When the creditor receives a mail or telephone request for credit, except for extensions of \ncredit covered by sections 226.19(a) and 226.19(b), the creditor may delay making the disclosures until the first \npayment is due if the following conditions are met:\n\n[.]i. The credit request is initiated without face-to-face or direct telephone solicitation. (Creditors may, however, use \nthe special rule when credit requests are solicited by mail.)\n\n[.]ii. The creditor has supplied the specified credit information about its credit terms either to the individual consumer \nor to the public generally. That information may be distributed through advertisements, catalogs, brochures, special \nmailers, or similar means.\n\n2. Insurance. The location requirements for the insurance disclosures under \u00a7 226.18(n) permit them to appear \napart from the other disclosures. Therefore, a creditor may mail an insurance authorization to the consumer and \nthen prepare the other disclosures to reflect whether or not the authorization is completed by the consumer. \nCreditors may also disclose the insurance cost on a unit-cost basis, if the transaction meets the requirements of \u00a7 \n226.17(g).\n\n17(h) Series of sales--delay in disclosures.\n\n1. Applicability. The creditor may delay the disclosures for individual credit sales in a series of such sales until the \nfirst payment is due on the current sale, assuming the 2 conditions in this paragraph are met. If those conditions are \nnot met, the general timing rules in [\u00a7 266.17(b)] \u00a7 226.17(b) apply.\n\n2. Basis of disclosures. Creditors structuring disclosures for a series of sales under \u00a7 226.17(h) may compute the \ntotal sale price as either:\n\n[.]i. The cash price for the sale plus that portion of the finance charge and other charges applicable to that sale; or\n\n[.]ii. The cash price for the sale, other charges applicable to the sale, and the total finance charge and outstanding \nprincipal.\n\n17(i) Interim student credit extensions.\n\n1. Definition. Student credit plans involve extensions of credit for education purposes where the repayment amount \nand schedule are not known at the time credit is advanced. These plans include loans made under any student \ncredit plan, whether government or private, where the repayment period does not begin immediately. (Certain \nstudent credit plans that meet this definition are exempt from Regulation Z. See \u00a7 226.3(f).) Creditors in interim \nstudent credit extensions need not disclose the terms set forth in this paragraph at the time the credit is actually \nextended but must make complete disclosures at the time the creditor and consumer agree upon the repayment \nschedule for the total obligation. At that time, a new set of disclosures must be made of all applicable items under \u00a7 \n226.18.\n\n2. Basis of disclosures. The disclosures given at the time of execution of the interim note should reflect two annual \npercentage rates, one for the interim period and one for the repayment period. The use of \u00a7 226.17(i) in making \ndisclosures does not, by itself, make those disclosures estimates. Any portion of the finance charge, such as \nstatutory interest, that is attributable to the interim period and is paid by the student (either as a prepaid finance \ncharge, periodically during the interim period, in one payment at the end of the interim period, or capitalized at the \nbeginning of the repayment period) must be reflected in the interim annual percentage rate. Interest subsidies, such \nas payments made by either a State or the Federal government on an interim loan, must be excluded in computing \nthe annual percentage rate on the interim obligation, when the consumer has no contingent liability for payment of \n\n\n\nthose amounts. Any finance charges that are paid separately by the student at the outset or withheld from the \nproceeds of the loan are prepaid finance charges. An example of this type of charge is the loan guarantee fee. The \nsum of the prepaid finance charges is deducted from the loan proceeds to determine the amount financed and \nincluded in the calculation of the finance charge.\n\n3. Consolidation. Consolidation of the interim student credit extensions through a renewal note with a set repayment \nschedule is treated as a new transaction with disclosures made as they would be for a refinancing. Any unearned \nportion of the finance charge must be reflected in the new finance charge and annual percentage rate, and is not \nadded to the new amount financed. In itemizing the amount financed under \u00a7 226.18(c), the creditor may combine \nthe principal balances remaining on the interim extensions at the time of consolidation and categorize them as the \namount paid on the consumer's account.\n\n4. Approved student credit forms. See the commentary to appendix H regarding disclosure forms approved for use \nin certain student credit programs.\n\n\u00a7 226.18--Content of Disclosures.\n\n1. As applicable. i. The disclosures required by this section need be made only as applicable. Any disclosure not \nrelevant to a particular transaction may be eliminated entirely. For example:\n\n[.]A. In a loan transaction, the creditor may delete disclosure of the total sale price.\n\n[.]B. In a credit sale requiring disclosure of the total sale price under \u00a7 226.18(j), the creditor may delete any \nreference to a downpayment where no downpayment is involved.\n\nii. Where the amounts of several numerical disclosures are the same, the \"as applicable\" language also permits \ncreditors to combine the terms, so long as it is done in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example:\n\n[.]A. In a transaction in which the amount financed equals the total of payments, the creditor may disclose \"amount \nfinanced/total of payments,\" together with descriptive language, followed by a single amount.\n\n[.]B. However, if the terms are separated on the disclosure statement and separate space is provided for each \namount, both disclosures must be completed, even though the same amount is entered in each space.\n\n2. Format. See the commentary to \u00a7 226.17 and appendix H for a discussion of the format to be used in making \nthese disclosures, as well as acceptable modifications.\n\n18(a) Creditor.\n\n1. Identification of creditor. The creditor making the disclosures must be identified. [This disclosure may, at the \ncreditor's option, appear apart from the other disclosures.] Use of the creditor's name is sufficient, but the creditor \nmay also include an address and/or telephone number. In transactions with multiple creditors, any one of them may \nmake the disclosures; the one doing so must be identified.\n\n18(b) Amount financed.\n\n1. Disclosure required. The net amount of credit extended must be disclosed using the term amount financed and a \ndescriptive explanation similar to the phrase in the regulation.\n\n2. Rebates and loan premiums. In a loan transaction, the creditor may offer a premium in the form of cash or \nmerchandise to prospective borrowers. Similarly, in a credit sale transaction, a seller's or manufacturer's rebate \nmay be offered to prospective purchasers of the creditor's goods or services. Such premiums and rebates must be \nreflected in accordance with the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. See \u00a7 226.17(c)(1) and its \ncommentary. Thus, if the creditor is legally obligated to provide the premium or rebate to the consumer as part of \nthe credit transaction, the disclosures should reflect its value in the manner and at the time the creditor is obligated \n\n\n\nto provide it. [At the creditor's option, these amounts may be either reflected in the Truth in Lending disclosures or \ndisregarded in the disclosures. If the creditor chooses to reflect them in the \u00a7 226.18 disclosures, rather than \ndisregard them, they may be taken into account in any manner as part of those disclosures.]\n\nParagraph 18(b)(1).\n\n1. Downpayments. A downpayment is defined in \u00a7 226.2(a)(18) to include, at the creditor's option, certain deferred \ndownpayments or pick-up payments. A deferred downpayment that meets the criteria set forth in the definition may \nbe treated as part of the downpayment, at the creditor's option.\n\n[.]i. Deferred downpayments that are not treated as part of the downpayment (either because they do not meet the \ndefinition or because the creditor simply chooses not to treat them as downpayments) are included in the amount \nfinanced.\n\n[.]ii. Deferred downpayments that are treated as part of the downpayment are not part of the amount financed under \n\u00a7 226.18(b)(1).\n\nParagraph 18(b)(2).\n\n1. Adding other amounts. Fees or other charges that are not part of the finance charge and that are financed rather \nthan paid separately at consummation of the transaction are included in the amount financed. Typical examples are \n[real estate settlement charges and] premiums for voluntary credit life and disability insurance excluded from the \nfinance charge under \u00a7 226.4. This paragraph does not include any amounts already accounted for under \u00a7 \n226.18(b)(1), such as taxes, tag and title fees, or the costs of accessories or service policies that the creditor \nincludes in the cash price.\n\nParagraph 18(b)(3).\n\n1. Prepaid finance charges. i. Prepaid finance charges that are paid separately in cash or by check should be \ndeducted under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3) in calculating the amount financed. To illustrate[. A], a consumer applies for a loan \nof $ 2,500 with a $ 40 loan fee. The face amount of the note is $ 2,500 and the consumer pays the loan fee \nseparately by cash or check at closing. The principal loan amount for purposes of \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) is $ 2,500 and $ \n40 should be deducted under \u00a7 226.18(b(3), thereby yielding an amount financed of $ 2,460.\n\nii. In some instances, as when loan fees are financed by the creditor, finance charges are incorporated in the face \namount of the note. Creditors have the option, when the charges are not add-on or discount charges, of determining \na principal loan amount under \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) that either includes or does not include the amount of the finance \ncharges. (Thus the principal loan amount may, but need not, be determined to equal the face amount of the note.) \nWhen the finance charges are included in the principal loan amount, they should be deducted as prepaid finance \ncharges under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3). When the finance charges are not included in the principal loan amount, they should \nnot be deducted under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3). The following examples illustrate the application of \u00a7 226.18(b) to this type of \ntransaction. Each example assumes a loan request of $ 2,500 with a loan fee of $ 40; the creditor assesses the \nloan fee by increasing the face amount of the note to $ 2,540.\n\n[.]A. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) to be $ 2,540, it has included the loan \nfee in the principal loan amount and should deduct $ 40 as a prepaid finance charge under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3), thereby \nobtaining an amount financed of $ 2,500.\n\n[.]B. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) to be $ 2,500, it has not included the \nloan fee in the principal loan amount and should not deduct any amount under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an \namount financed of $ 2,500.\n\niii. The same rules apply when the creditor does not increase the face amount of the note by the amount of the \ncharge but collects the charge by withholding it from the amount advanced to the consumer. To illustrate, the \n\n\n\nfollowing examples assume a loan request of $ 2,500 with a loan fee of $ 40; the creditor prepares a note for $ \n2,500 and advances $ 2,460 to the consumer.\n\n[.]A. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) to be $ 2,500, it has included the loan \nfee in the principal loan amount and should deduct $ 40 as a prepaid finance charge under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3), thereby \nobtaining an amount financed of $ 2,460.\n\n[.]B. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) to be $ 2,460, it has not included the \nloan fee in the principal loan amount and should not deduct any amount under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an \namount financed of $ 2,460.\n\niv. Thus in the examples where the creditor derives the net amount of credit by determining a principal loan amount \nthat does not include the amount of the finance charge, no subtraction is appropriate. Creditors should note, \nhowever, that although the charges are not subtracted as prepaid finance charges in those examples, they are \nnonetheless finance charges and must be treated as such.\n\n2. Add-on or discount charges. All finance charges must be deducted from the amount of credit in calculating the \namount financed. If the principal loan amount reflects finance charges that meet the definition of a prepaid finance \ncharge in \u00a7 226.2, those charges are included in the \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) amount and deducted under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3). \nHowever, if the principal loan amount includes finance charges that do not meet the definition of a prepaid finance \ncharge, the \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) amount must exclude those finance charges. The following examples illustrate the \napplication of \u00a7 226.18(b) to these types of transactions. Each example assumes a loan request of $ 1000 for 1 \nyear, subject to a 6 percent precomputed interest rate, with a $ 10 loan fee paid separately at consummation.\n\n[.]i. The creditor assesses add-on interest of $ 60 which is added to the $ 1000 in loan proceeds for an obligation \nwith a face amount of $ 1060. The principal for purposes of \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) is $ 1000, no amounts are added under \n\u00a7 226.18(b)(2), and the $ 10 loan fee is a prepaid finance charge to be deducted under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3). The amount \nfinanced is $ 990.\n\n[.]ii. The creditor assesses discount interest of $ 60 and distributes $ 940 to the consumer, who is liable for an \nobligation with a face amount of $ 1000. The principal under \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) is $ 940, which results in an amount \nfinanced of $ 930, after deduction of the $ 10 prepaid finance charge under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3).\n\n[.]iii. The creditor assesses $ 60 in discount interest by increasing the face amount of the obligation to $ 1060, with \nthe consumer receiving $ 1000. The principal under \u00a7 226.18(b)(1) is thus $ 1000 and the amount financed $ 990, \nafter deducting the $ 10 prepaid finance charge under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3).\n\n18(c) Itemization of amount financed.\n\n1. Disclosure required. i. The creditor has 2 alternatives in complying with \u00a7 226.18(c):\n\n[.]A. The creditor may inform the consumer, on the segregated disclosures, that a written itemization of the amount \nfinanced will be provided on request, furnishing the itemization only if the customer in fact requests it.\n\n[.]B. The creditor may provide an itemization as a matter of course, without notifying the consumer of the right to \nreceive it or waiting for a request.\n\nii. Whether given as a matter of course or only on request, the itemization must be provided at the same time as the \nother disclosures required by \u00a7 226.18, although separate from those disclosures.\n\n2. Additional information. Section 226.18(c) establishes only a minimum standard for the material to be included in \nthe itemization of the amount financed. Creditors have considerable flexibility in revising or supplementing the \ninformation listed in \u00a7 226.18(c) and shown in model form H-3, although no changes are required. The creditor \nmay, for example, do one or more of the following:\n\n\n\ni. Include amounts that reflect payments not part of the amount financed. For example, [escrow items and] certain \ninsurance premiums may be included, even though they are neither part of the amount financed nor prepaid finance \ncharges. [as discussed in the commentary to \u00a7 226.18(g).]\n\nii. Organize the categories in any order. For example, the creditor may rearrange the terms in a mathematical \nprogression that depicts the arithmetic relationship of the terms.\n\niii. Add categories. For example, in a credit sale, the creditor may include the cash price and the downpayment. If \nthe credit sale involves a trade-in of the consumer's car and an existing lien on that car exceeds the value of the \ntradein amount, the creditor may disclose the consumer's trade-in value, the creditor's payoff of the existing lien, \nand the resulting additional amount financed.\n\niv. Further itemize each category. For example, the amount paid directly to the consumer may be subdivided into \nthe amount given by check and the amount credited to the consumer's savings account.\n\nv. Label categories with different language from that shown in \u00a7 226.18(c). For example, an amount paid on the \nconsumer's account may be revised to specifically identify the account as \"your auto loan with us.\"\n\nvi. Delete, leave blank, mark \"N/A,\" or otherwise note [not] inapplicable categories in the itemization. For example, \nin a credit sale with no prepaid finance charges or amounts paid to others, the amount financed may consist of only \nthe cash price less downpayment. In this case, the itemization may be composed of only a single category and all \nother categories may be eliminated.\n\n3. Amounts appropriate to more than one category. When an amount may appropriately be placed in any of several \ncategories and the creditor does not wish to revise the categories shown in \u00a7 226.18(c), the creditor has \nconsiderable flexibility in determining where to show the amount. For example[:], [.][I]in a credit sale, the portion of \nthe purchase price being financed by the creditor may be viewed as either an amount paid to the consumer or an \namount paid on the consumer's account.\n\n[4. RESPA transactions. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requires creditors to provide a good \nfaith estimate of closing costs and a settlement statement listing the amounts paid by the consumer. Transactions \nsubject to RESPA are exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 226.18(c) if the creditor complies with RESPA's \nrequirements for a good faith estimate and settlement statement. The itemization of the amount financed need not \nbe given, even though the content and timing of the good faith estimate and settlement statement under RESPA \ndiffer from the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 226.18(c) and 226.19(a)(2). If a creditor chooses to substitute RESPA's \nsettlement statement for the itemization when redisclosure is required under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2), the statement must be \ndelivered to the consumer at or prior to consummation. The disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.18(c) and 226.19(a)(2) \nmay appear on the same page or on the same document as the good faith estimate or the settlement statement, so \nlong as the requirements of \u00a7 226.17(a) are met.]\n\nParagraph 18(c)(1)(i).\n\n1. Amounts paid to consumer. This encompasses funds given to the consumer in the form of cash or a check, \nincluding joint proceeds checks, as well as funds placed in an asset account. It may include money in an interest-\nbearing account even if that amount is considered a required deposit under \u00a7 226.18(r). For example, in a \ntransaction with total loan proceeds of $ 500, the consumer receives a check for $ 300 and $ 200 is required by the \ncreditor to be put into an interest-bearing account. Whether or not the $ 200 is a required deposit, it is part of the \namount financed. At the creditor's option, it may be broken out and labeled in the itemization of the amount \nfinanced.\n\nParagraph 18(c)(1)(ii).\n\n1. Amounts credited to consumer's account. The term consumer's account refers to an account in the nature of a \ndebt with that creditor. It may include, for example, an unpaid balance on a prior loan, a credit sale balance or other \n\n\n\namounts owing to that creditor. It does not include asset accounts of the consumer such as savings or checking \naccounts.\n\nParagraph 18(c)(1)(iii).\n\n1. Amounts paid to others. This includes, for example, tag and title fees; amounts paid to insurance companies for \ninsurance premiums; security interest fees, and amounts paid to credit bureaus, appraisers or public officials. When \nseveral types of insurance premiums are financed, they may, at the creditor's option, be combined and listed in one \nsum, labeled \"insurance\" or similar term. This includes, but is not limited to, different types of insurance premiums \npaid to one company and different types of insurance premiums paid to different companies. Except for insurance \ncompanies and other categories noted in footnote 41, third parties must be identified by name.\n\n2. Charges added to amounts paid to others. A sum is sometimes added to the amount of a fee charged to a \nconsumer for a service provided by a third party (such as for an extended warranty or a  service contract) that is \npayable in the same amount in comparable cash and credit transactions. In the credit transaction, the amount is \nretained by the creditor. Given the flexibility permitted in meeting the requirements of the amount financed \nitemization (see the commentary to \u00a7 226.18(c)), the creditor in such cases may reflect that the creditor has \nretained a portion of the amount paid to others. For example, the creditor could add to the category \"amount paid to \nothers\" language such as \"(we may be retaining a portion of this amount).\"\n\nParagraph 18(c)(1)(iv).\n\n1. Prepaid finance charge. Prepaid finance charges that are deducted under \u00a7 226.18(b)(3) must be disclosed \nunder this section. The prepaid finance charges must be shown as a total amount but may, at the creditor's option, \nalso be further itemized and described. All amounts must be reflected in this total, even if portions of the prepaid \nfinance charge are also reflected elsewhere. For example, if at consummation the creditor collects interim interest \nof $ 30 and a credit report fee of $ 10, a total prepaid finance charge of $ 40 must be shown. At the creditor's \noption, the credit report fee paid to a third party may also be shown elsewhere as an amount included in \u00a7 \n226.18(c)(1)(iii). The creditor may also further describe the 2 components of the prepaid finance charge, although \nno itemization of this element is required by \u00a7 226.18(c)(1)(iv).\n\n[2. Prepaid mortgage insurance premiums. RESPA requires creditors to give consumers a settlement statement \ndisclosing the costs associated with mortgage loan transactions. Included on the settlement statement are \nmortgage insurance premiums collected at settlement, which are prepaid finance charges. In calculating the total \namount of prepaid finance charges, creditors should use the amount for mortgage insurance listed on the line for \nmortgage insurance on the settlement statement (line 1002 on HUD--1 or HUD 1--A), without adjustment, even if \nthe actual amount collected at settlement may vary because of RESPA's escrow accounting rules. Figures for \nmortgage insurance disclosed in conformance with RESPA shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of \nRegulation Z.]\n\n18(d) Finance charge.\n\n1. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the finance charge as a dollar amount, using the term \"finance \ncharge,\" and must include a brief description similar to that in \u00a7 226.18(d). The creditor may, but need not, further \nmodify the descriptor for variable rate transactions with a phrase such as \"which is subject to change.\" The finance \ncharge must be shown on the disclosures only as a total amount; the elements of the finance charge must not be \nitemized in the segregated disclosures, although the regulation does not prohibit their itemization elsewhere.\n\n[2. [Reserved]]\n\n(18(d)(2) Other Credit]\n\n\n\n[1] 2. Tolerance. When a finance-charge error results in a misstatement of the amount financed, or some other \ndollar amount for which the regulation provides no specific tolerance, the misstated disclosure does not violate the \nact or the regulation if the finance-charge error is within the permissible tolerance in this paragraph.\n\n18(e) Annual percentage rate.\n\n1. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the cost of the credit as an annual rate, using the term \"annual \npercentage rate,\" plus a brief descriptive phrase comparable to that used in \u00a7 226.18(e). For variable rate \ntransactions, the descriptor may be further modified with a phrase such as \"which is subject to change.\" Under \u00a7 \n226.17(a), the terms \"annual percentage rate\" and \"finance charge\" must be more conspicuous than the other \nrequired disclosures.\n\n2. Exception. [Footnote 42] Section 226.18(e) provides an exception for certain transactions in which no annual \npercentage rate disclosure is required.\n\n18(f) Variable rate.\n\n1. Coverage. The requirements of \u00a7 226.18(f) apply to [all] transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling in \nwhich the terms of the legal obligation allow the creditor to increase the rate [originally disclosed to the consumer. It \nincludes] charged when the transaction is consummated. Increases in rate include not only increases in the interest \nrate but also increases in other components, such as the rate of required credit life insurance. [The provisions, \nhowever, do not apply to] However, increases in rate do not include increases resulting from delinquency (including \nlate payment), default, assumption, acceleration or transfer of the collateral, because creditors may assume that \nconsumers abide by the terms of the legal obligation. See comment 17(c)(1)-1. [Section 226.18(f)(1) applies to \nvariable-rate transactions that are not secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and to those that are secured \nby the principal dwelling but have a term of one year or less. Section 226.18(f)(2) applies to variable-rate \ntransactions that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and have a term greater than one year. \nMoreover, transactions subject to section 226.18(f)(2) are subject to the special early-disclosure requirements of \nsection 226.19(b). (However, \"shared-equity\" or \"shared-appreciation\" mortgages are subject to the disclosure \nrequirements of section 226.18(f)(1) and not to the requirements of sections 226.18(f)(2) and 226.19(b) regardless \nof the general coverage of those sections.) Creditors are permitted under footnote 43 to substitute in any variable-\nrate transaction the disclosures required under Section 226.19(b) for those disclosures ordinarily required under \nSection 226.18(f)(1). Creditors who provide variable-rate disclosures under section 226.19(b) must comply with all \nof the requirements of that section, including the timing of disclosures, and must also provide the disclosures \nrequired under section 226.18(f)(2). Creditors utilizing footnote 43 may, but need not, also provide disclosures \npursuant to section 226.20(c). (Substitution of disclosures under section 226.18(f)(1) in transactions subject to \nsection 226.19(b) is not permitted under the footnote.)]\n\n[Paragraph 18(f)(1).]\n\n[1.] 2. Terms used in disclosure. In describing the variable rate feature, the creditor need not use any prescribed \nterminology. For example, limitations and hypothetical examples may be described in terms of interest rates rather \nthan annual percentage rates. The model forms in appendix H provide examples of ways in which the variable rate \ndisclosures may be made.\n\n[2.] 3. Conversion feature. In variable-rate transactions with an option permitting consumers to convert to a fixed-\nrate transaction, the conversion option is a variable-rate feature that must be disclosed. In making disclosures \nunder \u00a7 226.18(f)[(1)], creditors should disclose the fact that the rate may increase upon conversion; identify the \nindex or formula used to set the fixed rate; and state any limitations on and effects of an increase resulting from \nconversion that differ from other variable-rate features. Because \u00a7 226.18(0[(1)(iv)] (4) requires only one \nhypothetical example (such as an example of the effect on payments resulting from changes in the index), a second \nhypothetical example need not be given.\n\nParagraph 18(f)(1)((i)].\n\n\n\n1. Circumstances. The circumstances under which the rate may increase include identification of any index to which \nthe rate is tied, as well as any conditions or events on which the increase is contingent.\n\ni. When no specific index is used, any identifiable factors used to determine  whether to increase the rate must be \ndisclosed.\n\nii. When the increase in the rate is purely discretionary, the fact that any increase is within the creditor's discretion \nmust be disclosed.\n\niii. When the index is internally defined (for example, by that creditor's prime rate), the creditor may comply with this \nrequirement by either a brief description of that index or a statement that any increase is in the discretion of the \ncreditor. An externally defined index, however, must be identified.\n\nParagraph 18(f)[(1)(ii)](2).\n\n1. Limitations. This includes any maximum imposed on the amount of an increase in the rate at any time, as well as \nany maximum on the total increase over the life of the transaction. When there are no limitations, the creditor may, \nbut need not, disclose that fact. Limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under \nState or Federal statutes or regulations. (See \u00a7 226.30 for the rule requiring that a maximum interest rate be \nincluded in certain variable-rate transactions.)\n\nParagraph 18(f)[(1)(iii)](3).\n\n1. Effects. Disclosure of the effect of an increase refers to an increase in the number or amount of payments or an \nincrease in the final payment. In addition, the creditor may make a brief reference to negative amortization that may \nresult from a rate increase. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) regarding directly related information.) If the \neffect cannot be determined, the creditor must provide a statement of the possible effects. For example, if the \nexercise of the variable-rate feature may result in either more or larger payments, both possibilities must be noted.\n\nParagraph 18(f)[(1)(iv)](4).\n\n1. Hypothetical example. The example may, at the creditor's option appear apart from the other disclosures. The \ncreditor may provide either a standard example that illustrates the terms and conditions of that type of credit offered \nby that creditor or an example that directly reflects the terms and conditions of the particular transaction. In \ntransactions with more than one variable-rate feature, only one hypothetical example need be provided. (See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) regarding disclosure of more than one hypothetical example as directly related \ninformation.)\n\n2. Hypothetical example not required. The creditor need not provide a hypothetical example in the following \ntransactions with a variable-rate feature:\n\ni. Demand obligations with no alternate maturity date.\n\nii. Interim student credit extensions.\n\niii. Multiple-advance construction loans disclosed pursuant to appendix D, Part I.\n\n[Paragraph 18(f)(2).\n\n1. Disclosure required. In variable-rate transactions that have a term greater than one year and are secured by the \nconsumer's principal dwelling, the creditor must give special early disclosures under section 226.19(b) in addition to \nthe later disclosures required under section 226.18(f)(2). The disclosures under section 226.18(f)(2) must state that \nthe transaction has a variable-rate feature and that variable-rate disclosures have been provided earlier. (See the \ncommentary to section 226.17(a)(1) regarding the disclosure of certain directly related information in addition to the \nvariable-rate disclosures required under section 226.18(f)(2).)]\n\n\n\n18(g) Payment schedule.\n\n1. Amounts included in repayment schedule. The repayment schedule should reflect all components of the finance \ncharge, not merely the portion attributable to interest. A prepaid finance charge, however, should not be shown in \nthe repayment schedule as a separate payment. The payments may include amounts beyond the amount financed \nand finance charge. For example, the disclosed payments may, at the creditor's option, reflect certain insurance \npremiums where the premiums are not part of either the amount financed or the finance charge, as well as real \nestate escrow amounts such as taxes added to the payment in mortgage transactions.\n\n2. Deferred downpayments. As discussed in the commentary to \u00a7 226.2(a)(18), deferred downpayments or pick-up \npayments that meet the conditions set forth in the definition of downpayment may be treated as part of the \ndownpayment. Even if treated as a downpayment, that amount may nevertheless be disclosed as part of the \npayment schedule, at the creditor's option.\n\n3. Total number of payments.\n\nExcept for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, i[I]n disclosing the number of payments for \ntransactions with more than one payment level, creditors may but need not disclose as a single figure the total \nnumber of payments for all levels. For example, in a transaction calling for 108 payments of $ 350, 240 payments of \n$ 335, and 12 payments of $ 330, the creditors need not state that there will be a total of 360 payments. For \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling, creditors must disclose as a single figure the total number of \npayments for all levels. See \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i).\n\n4. Timing of payments. i. General rule. Section 226.18(g) requires creditors to disclose the timing of payments. To \nmeet this requirement, creditors may list all of the payment due dates. They also have the option of specifying the \n\"period of payments\" scheduled to repay the obligation. As a general rule, creditors that choose this option must \ndisclose the payment intervals or frequency, such as \"monthly\" or \"biweekly,\" and the calendar date that the \nbeginning payment is due. For example, a creditor may disclose that payments are due \"monthly beginning on July \n1, 1998.\" This information, when combined with the number of payments, is necessary to define the repayment \nperiod and enable a consumer to determine all of the payment due dates.\n\nii. Exception. In a limited number of circumstances, the beginning-payment date is unknown and difficult to \ndetermine at the time disclosures are made. For example, a consumer may become obligated on a credit contract \nthat contemplates the delayed disbursement of funds based on a contingent event, such as the completion of home \nrepairs. Disclosures may also accompany loan checks that are sent by mail, in which case the initial disbursement \nand repayment dates are solely within the consumer's control. In such cases, if the beginning-payment date is \nunknown the creditor may use an estimated date and label the disclosure as an estimate pursuant to \u00a7 226.17(c). \nAlternatively, the disclosure may refer to the occurrence of a particular event, for example, by disclosing that the \nbeginning payment is due \"30 days after the first loan disbursement.\" This information also may be included with an \nestimated date to explain the basis for the creditor's estimate. See comment 17(a)(1)-5(iii).\n\n5. Mortgage insurance. The payment schedule should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance payments until \nthe date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the \nconsumer may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. The payment schedule must reflect \nthe legal obligation, as determined by applicable State or other law. For example, assume that under applicable \nlaw, mortgage insurance must terminate after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and the creditor collects at \nclosing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor will include \nmortgage insurance premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed payments when the insurance is \nterminated, the payment schedule  should reflect 130 premium payments. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor \nwill apply the amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments, the payment schedule should reflect 128 \nmonthly premium payments. (For assumptions in calculating a payment schedule that includes mortgage insurance \nthat must be automatically terminated, see comments [17(c)(1)-8 and 17(c)(1)-10] 17(c)(1)(iii)-1 and 17(c)(1)(iii)-3.)\n\n[Paragraph]18(h) Total of payments.\n\n\n\n1. Disclosure required. The total of payments must be disclosed using that term, along with a descriptive phrase \nsimilar to the one in the regulation. The descriptive explanation may be revised to reflect a variable rate feature with \na brief phrase such as \"based on the current annual percentage rate which may change.\"\n\n2. Calculation of total of payments. The total of payments is the sum of the payments disclosed under \u00a7 226.18(g). \nFor example, if the creditor disclosed a deferred portion of the downpayment as part of the payment schedule, that \npayment must be reflected in the total disclosed under this paragraph.\n\n3. Exception. [Footnote 44] Section 226.18(h) permits creditors to omit disclosure of the total of payments in single-\npayment transactions. This exception does not apply to a transaction calling for a single payment of principal \ncombined with periodic payments of interest.\n\n4. Demand obligations. In demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the creditor may omit disclosure of \npayment amounts under \u00a7 226.18(g)(1). In those transactions, the creditor need not disclose the total of payments.\n\n[Paragraph] 18(i) Demand feature.\n\n1. Disclosure requirements. The disclosure requirements of this provision apply not only to transactions payable on \ndemand from the outset, but also to transactions that are not payable on demand at the time of consummation but \nconvert to a demand status after a stated period. In demand obligations in which the disclosures are based on an \nassumed maturity of 1 year under \u00a7 226.17(c)(5), that fact must also be stated. Appendix H contains model clauses \nthat may be used in making this disclosure.\n\n2. Covered demand features. The type of demand feature triggering the disclosures required by section 226.18(i), \nor section 226.38(d)(2)(iv) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, includes only those demand \nfeatures contemplated by the parties as part of the legal obligation. For example, [this provision] section 226.18(i), \nor section 226.38(d)(2)(iv) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, do[es] not apply to transactions \nthat convert to a demand status as a result of the consumer's default. A due-on-sale clause is not considered a \ndemand feature. A creditor may, but need not, treat its contractual right to demand payment of a loan made to its \nexecutive officers as a demand feature to the extent that the contractual right is required by Regulation O (12 CFR \n215.5) or other federal law.\n\n3. Relationship to payment schedule disclosures. As provided in section 226.18(g)(1), or section 226.38(c) for \ntransactions secured by real property or a dwelling, in demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the \ncreditor need only disclose the due dates or payment periods of any scheduled interest payments for the first year. \nIf the demand obligation states an alternate maturity, however, the disclosed payment schedule must reflect that \nstated term; the special rule in section 226.18(g)(1), or section 226.38(c) for transactions secured by real property \nor a dwelling, is not available.\n\n[Paragraph] 18(j) Total sale price.\n\n1. Disclosure required. In a credit sale transaction, the total sale price must be disclosed using that term, along with \na descriptive explanation similar to the one in the regulation. For variable rate transactions, the descriptive phrase \nmay, at the creditor's option, be modified to reflect the variable rate feature. For example, the descriptor may read: \n\"The total cost of your purchase on credit, which is subject to change, including your downpayment of * * *.\" The \nreference to a downpayment may be eliminated in transactions calling for no downpayment.\n\n2. Calculation of total sale price. The figure to be disclosed is the sum of the cash price, other charges added under \n\u00a7 226.18(b)(2), and the finance charge disclosed under \u00a7 226.18(d).\n\n3. Effect of existing liens. When a credit sale transaction involves property that is being used as a trade-in (an \nautomobile, for example) and that has a lien exceeding the value of the trade-in, the total sale price is affected by \nthe amount of any cash provided. (See comment 2(a)(18)-3.) To illustrate, assume a consumer finances the \n\n\n\npurchase of an automobile with a cash price of $ 20,000. Another vehicle used as a trade-in has a value of $ 8,000 \nbut has an existing lien of $ 10,000, leaving a $ 2,000 deficit that the consumer must finance.\n\ni. If the consumer pays $ 1,500 in cash, the creditor may apply the cash first to the lien, leaving a $ 500 deficit, and \nreflect a downpayment of $ 0. The total sale price would include the $ 20,000 cash price, an additional $ 500 \nfinanced under \u00a7 226.18(b)(2), and the amount of the finance charge. Alternatively, the creditor may reflect a \ndownpayment of $ 1,500 and finance the $ 2,000 deficit. In that case, the total sale price would include the sum of \nthe $ 20,000 cash price, the $ 2,000 lien payoff amount as an additional amount financed, and the amount of the \nfinance charge.\n\nii. If the consumer pays $ 3,000 in cash, the creditor may apply the cash first to extinguish the lien and reflect the \nremainder as a downpayment of $ 1,000. The total sale price would reflect the $ 20,000 cash price and the amount \nof the finance charge. (The cash payment extinguishes the trade-in deficit and no charges are added under \u00a7 \n226.18(b)(2).) Alternatively, the creditor may elect to reflect a downpayment of $ 3,000 and finance the $ 2,000 \ndeficit. In that case, the total sale price would include the sum of the $ 20,000 cash price, the $ 2,000 lien payoff \namount as an additional amount financed, and the amount of the finance charge.\n\n[Paragraph] 18(k) Prepayment.\n\n1. Disclosure required. The creditor must give a definitive statement of whether or not a penalty will be imposed or a \nrebate will be given.\n\n[.] iii. The fact that no penalty will be imposed may not simply be inferred from the absence of a penalty disclosure; \nthe creditor must indicate that prepayment will not result in a penalty.\n\n[.] ii. If a penalty or refund is possible for one type of prepayment, even though not for all, a positive disclosure is \nrequired. This applies to any type of prepayment, whether voluntary or involuntary as in the case of prepayments \nresulting from acceleration.\n\n[.] iii. Any difference in rebate or penalty policy, depending on whether prepayment is voluntary or not, must not be \ndisclosed with the segregated disclosures.\n\n2. Rebate-penalty disclosure. A single transaction may involve both a precomputed finance charge and a finance \ncharge computed by application of a rate to the unpaid balance (for example, mortgages with mortgage-guarantee \ninsurance). In these cases, disclosures about both prepayment rebates and penalties are required. Sample form H-\n15 in appendix H illustrates a mortgage transaction in which both rebate and penalty disclosures are necessary.\n\n 3. Prepaid finance charge. The existence of a prepaid finance charge in a transaction does not, by itself, require a \ndisclosure under \u00a7 226.18(k). A prepaid finance charge is not considered a penalty under \u00a7 226.18(k)(1), nor does it \nrequire a disclosure under \u00a7 226.18(k)(2). At its option, however, a creditor may consider a prepaid finance charge \nto be under \u00a7 226.18(k)(2). If a disclosure is made under \u00a7 226.18(k)(2) with respect to a prepaid finance charge or \nother finance charge, the creditor may further identify that finance charge. For example, the disclosure may state \nthat the borrower \"will not be entitled to a refund of the prepaid finance charge\" or some other term that describes \nthe finance charge.\n\nParagraph 18(k)(1).\n\n1. Penalty. [This] Section 226.18(k)(1) applies only to those transactions in which the interest calculation takes \naccount of all scheduled reductions in principal, as well as transactions in which interest calculations are made \ndaily. The term penalty as used here encompasses only those charges that are assessed strictly because of the \nprepayment in full of a simple-interest obligation, as an addition to all other amounts. Items which are penalties \ninclude, for example:\n\n[. Interest charges for any period after prepayment in full is made.] i. Charges determined by treating the loan \nbalance as outstanding for a period after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such \"balance.\" (See \n\n\n\nthe commentary to \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) regarding disclosure of [interest] such charges assessed for periods after \nprepayment in full as directly related information, for transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling.)\n\n[.] ii. A minimum finance charge in a simple-interest transaction. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) regarding \nthe disclosure of a minimum finance charge as directly related information.) Items which are not penalties include, \nfor example[:],\n\n[. L] loan guarantee fees. [. Interim interest on a student loan.]\n\nParagraph 18(k)(2).\n\n1. Rebate of finance charge. This applies to any finance charges that do not take account of each reduction in the \nprincipal balance of an obligation. This category includes, for example:\n\n[.] i. Precomputed finance charges such as add-on charges.\n\n[.] ii. Charges that take account of some but not all reductions in principal, such as mortgage guarantee insurance \nassessed on the basis of an annual declining balance, when the principal is reduced on a monthly basis.\n\n2. Methodology of computing. No description of the method of computing earned or unearned finance charges is \nrequired or permitted as part of the segregated disclosures under this section.\n\n[Paragraph] 18(l) Late payment.\n\n1. Definition. This paragraph requires a disclosure only if charges are added to individual delinquent installments by \na creditor who otherwise considers the transaction ongoing on its original terms. Late payment charges do not \ninclude:\n\n[.]i. The right of acceleration. [.] ii. Fees imposed for actual collection costs, such as repossession charges or \nattorney's fees.\n\n[.] iii. Deferral and extension charges.\n\n[.] iv. The continued accrual of simple interest at the contract rate after the payment due date. However, an increase \nin the interest rate is a late payment charge to the extent of the increase.\n\n2. Content of disclosure. Many State laws authorize the calculation of late charges on the basis of either a \npercentage or a specified dollar amount, and permit imposition of the lesser or greater of the 2 charges. The \ndisclosure made under \u00a7 226.18(l) may reflect this alternative. For example, stating that the charge in the event of a \nlate payment is 5% of the late amount, not to exceed $ 5.00, is sufficient. Many creditors also permit a grace period \nduring which no late charge will be assessed; this fact may be disclosed as directly related information. (See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.17(a).)\n\n[Paragraph] 18(m) Security interest.\n\n1. Purchase money transactions. When the collateral is the item purchased as part of, or with the proceeds of, the \ncredit transaction, section 226.18(m) requires only a general identification such as \"the property purchased in this \ntransaction.\" However, the creditor may identify the property by item or type instead of identifying it more generally \nwith a phrase such as \"the property purchased in this transaction.\" For example, a creditor may identify collateral as \n\"a motor vehicle,\" or as \"the property purchased in this transaction.\" Any transaction in which the credit is being \nused to purchase the collateral is considered a purchase money transaction and the abbreviated identification may \nbe used, whether the obligation is treated as a loan or a credit sale.\n\n2. Nonpurchase money transactions. In nonpurchase money transactions, the property subject to the security \ninterest must be identified by item or type. This disclosure is satisfied by a general disclosure of the category of \nproperty subject to the security interest, such as \"motor vehicles,\" \"securities,\" \"certain household items,\" or \n\n\n\n\"household goods.\" (Creditors should be aware, however, that the Federal credit practices rules, as well as some \nState laws, prohibit certain security interests in household goods.) At the creditor's option, however, a more precise \nidentification of the property or goods may be provided.\n\n3. Mixed collateral. In some transactions in which the credit is used to purchase the collateral, the creditor may also \ntake other property of the consumer as security. In those cases, a combined disclosure must be provided, \nconsisting of an identification of the purchase money collateral consistent with comment 18(m)--1 and a specific \nidentification of the other collateral consistent with comment 18(m)--2.\n\n4. After-acquired property. An after-acquired property clause is not a security interest to be disclosed under \u00a7 \n226.18(m).\n\n5. Spreader clause. The fact that collateral for pre-existing credit with the institution is being used to secure the \npresent obligation constitutes a security interest and must be disclosed. (Such security interests may be known as \n\"spreader\" or \"dragnet\" clauses, or as \"cross-collateralization\" clauses.) A specific identification of that collateral is \nunnecessary but a reminder of the interest arising from the prior indebtedness is required. The disclosure may be \nmade by using language such as \"collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan.\" At the \ncreditor's option, a more specific description of the property involved may be given.\n\n6. Terms used in disclosure. No specified terminology is required in disclosing a security interest. Although the \ndisclosure may, at the creditor's option, use the term security interest, the creditor may designate its interest by \nusing, for example, pledge, lien, or mortgage.\n\n7. Collateral from third party. In certain transactions, the consumer's obligation may be secured by collateral \nbelonging to a third party. For example, a loan to a student may be secured by an interest in the property of the \nstudent's parents. In such cases, the security interest is taken in connection with the transaction and must be \ndisclosed, even though the property encumbered is owned by someone other than the consumer.\n\n 18(n) Insurance, [and] debt cancellation, and debt suspension.\n\n1. Location. This disclosure may, at the creditor's option, appear apart from the other disclosures. It may appear \nwith any other information, including the amount financed itemization, any information prescribed by State law, or \nother supplementary material. When this information is disclosed with the other segregated disclosures, however, \nno additional explanatory material may be included.\n\n2. Debt cancellation and debt suspension. Creditors may use the model credit-insurance disclosures only if the \ndebt-cancellation or debt suspension coverage constitutes insurance under State law. Otherwise, they may provide \na parallel disclosure that refers to debt-cancellation or debt suspension coverage.\n\n[Paragraph] 18(o) Certain security interest charges.\n\n1. Format. No special format is required for these disclosures; under \u00a7 226.4(e), taxes and fees paid to government \nofficials with respect to a security interest may be aggregated, or may be broken down by individual charge. For \nexample, the disclosure could be labeled \"filing fees and taxes\" and all funds disbursed for such purposes may be \naggregated in a single disclosure. This disclosure may appear, at the creditor's option, apart from the other required \ndisclosures. The inclusion of this information on a statement required under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures \nAct is sufficient disclosure for purposes of Truth in Lending.\n\n[Paragraph] 18(p) Contract reference.\n\n1. Content. Creditors may substitute, for the phrase \"appropriate contract document,\" a reference to specific \ntransaction documents in which the additional information is found, such as \"promissory note\" or \"retail installment \nsale contract.\" A creditor may, at its option, delete inapplicable items in the contract reference, as for example when \nthe contract documents contain no information regarding the right of acceleration.\n\n\n\n[18(q) Assumption policy\n\n1. Policy statement. In many mortgages, the creditor cannot determine, at the time disclosure must be made, \nwhether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause \ncommonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan \nMortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors such as the creditworthiness of the \nsubsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the lender's security, and execution of an assumption \nagreement by the subsequent borrower. In cases where uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a \nmortgage, the disclosure under \u00a7 226.18(q) should reflect that fact. In making disclosures in such cases, the \ncreditor may use phrases such as \"subject to conditions,\" \"under certain circumstances,\" or \"depending on future \nconditions.\" The creditor may provide a brief reference to more specific criteria such as a due-on-sale clause, \nalthough a complete explanation of all conditions is not appropriate. For example, the disclosure may state, \n\"Someone buying your home may be allowed to assume the mortgage on its original terms, subject to certain \nconditions, such as payment of an assumption fee.\" See comment 17(a)(1)-5 for an example of a reference to a \ndue-on-sale clause.\n\n2. Original terms. The phrase original terms for purposes of \u00a7 226.18(q) does not preclude the imposition of an \nassumption fee, but a modification of the basic credit agreement, such as a change in the contract interest rate, \nrepresents different terms.]\n\n[Paragraph] 18(r) Required deposit.\n\n1. Disclosure required. The creditor must inform the consumer of the existence of a required deposit. (Appendix H \nprovides a model clause that may be used in making that disclosure.) [Footnote 45 describes three] \u00a7 226.18(r)(1) \nand (2) describe two types of deposits that need not be considered required deposits. Use of the phrase \"need not\" \npermits creditors to include the disclosure even in cases where there is doubt as to whether the deposit constitutes \na required deposit.\n\n[2. Pledged-account mortgages. In these transactions, a consumer pledges as collateral funds that the consumer \ndeposits in an account held by the creditor. The creditor withdraws sums from that account to supplement the \nconsumer's periodic payments. Creditors may treat these pledged accounts as required deposits or they may treat \nthem as consumer buydowns in accordance with the commentary to section 226.17(c)(1).]\n\n3. Escrow accounts. The escrow exception in [footnote 45] \u00a7 226.18(r)(1) applies, for example, to accounts for such \nitems as maintenance fees, repairs, or improvements, whether in a realty or a nonrealty transaction. (See the \ncommentary to section 226.17(c)(1) regarding the use of escrow accounts in consumer buydown transactions.)\n\n4. Interest-bearing accounts. When a deposit earns at least 5 percent interest per year, no disclosure is required \nunder \u00a7 226.18(r). This exception applies whether the deposit is held by the creditor or by a third party.\n\n5. [Morris Plan transactions] Deposits applied solely to pay obligation. A deposit [under a Morris Plan, in which] to a \ndeposit account [is] created for the sole purpose of accumulating payments and [this is] applied to satisfy entirely \nthe consumer's obligation in the transaction[,] is not a required deposit.\n\n[6.] Examples of amounts excluded. The following are among the types of deposits that need not be treated as \nrequired deposits:\n\n[.] i. Requirement that a borrower be a customer or a member even if that involves a fee or a minimum balance.\n\n[.] ii. Required property insurance escrow on a mobile home transaction.\n\n[.] iii. Refund of interest when the obligation is paid in full.\n\n[.] iv. Deposits that are immediately available to the consumer.\n\n\n\n[.] v. Funds deposited with the creditor to be disbursed (for example, for construction) before the loan proceeds are \nadvanced.\n\n[.] vi. Escrow of condominium fees.\n\n[.] vii. Escrow of loan proceeds to be released when the repairs are completed.\n\n\u00a7 226.19-Certain Mortgage and Variable-Rate Transactions.\n\n19 Coverage.\n\n1. General. Section 226.19 applies to transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, other than home equity \nlines of credit subject to \u00a7 226.5b. Creditors must make the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19 even if the transaction \nis not subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. 2602 et seq., and its implementing \nRegulation X, 24 CFR 3500.1 et seq., administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). \nFor example, disclosures are required for construction loans that are not covered by RESPA or Regulation X \nbecause they are not considered \"federally related mortgage loans.\" See 12 U.S.C. 2602(1); 15 CFR 3500.2(b). \nHowever, \u00a7 226.19 only applies to transactions that are offered or extended to a consumer primarily for personal, \nfamily, or household purposes, even if the transactions are secured by real property or a dwelling. TILA and \nRegulation Z do not apply to transactions that are primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes. See \n15 U.S.C. 1603(1); \u00a7 226.3(a)(2). See also \u00a7 226.2(a)(12) and (b)(2). Section 226.19(a)(4) contains special \ndisclosure  timing requirements for mortgage transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan \ndescribed in 11 U.S.C. 101(53(D)).\n\n19(a)(1)(i) Time of disclosure.\n\n[1. Coverage. This section requires early disclosure of credit terms in mortgage transactions that are secured by a \nconsumer's dwelling (other than home equity lines of credit subject to \u00a7 226.5b or mortgage transactions secured \nby an interest in a timeshare plan) that are also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and \nits implementing Regulation X, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). To be \ncovered by \u00a7 226.19, a transaction must be a Federally related mortgage loan under RESPA. \"Federally related \nmortgage loan\" is defined under RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602) and Regulation X (24 CFR 3500.2), and is subject to any \ninterpretations by HUD.]\n\n[2.] 1. Timing and use of estimates. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i) must be delivered or mailed not \nlater than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application. The general definition \nof \"business day\" in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for substantially all of \nits business functions--is used for purposes of \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i). See comment 2(a)(6)-1. This general definition is \nconsistent with the definition of \"business day\" in HUD's Regulation X--a day on which the creditor's offices are \nopen to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions. See 24 CFR 3500.2. Accordingly, the \nthree-business-day period in \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i) for making early disclosures coincides with the time period within \nwhich creditors [subject to RESPA] must provide good faith estimates of settlement costs for transactions subject to \nRESPA. If the creditor does not know the precise credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures required by \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(1)(i) on the best information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are estimates under \u00a7 \n226.17(c)(2). If many of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as \n\"all numerical disclosures [except the late-payment disclosure] are estimates\") instead of separately labelling each \nestimate. In the alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items primarily affected by unknown \ninformation. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning the \nestimates and the contingencies that may affect the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.17(a)(1)[.] and \u00a7 226.37. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) may not contain estimates, however, with \nlimited exceptions. See the commentary on \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) for a discussion of limitations on estimates in disclosures \nmade under that subsection.\n\n\n\n[3.] 2. Written application. Creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X (including any interpretations issued by \nHUD) in deciding whether a \"written application\" has been received. In general, Regulation X defines an \n\"application\" to mean the submission of a borrower's financial information in anticipation of a credit decision relating \nto a [F] federally related mortgage loan. See 24 CFR 3500.2(b). Creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X \neven for a transaction not subject to RESPA. An application is received when it reaches the creditor in any of the \nways applications are normally transmitted--by mail, hand delivery, or through an intermediary agent or broker. (See \n[comment 19(b)-3] the commentary on \u00a7 19(d)(3) for guidance in determining whether or not the transaction \ninvolves an intermediary agent or broker.) If an application reaches the creditor through an intermediary agent or \nbroker, the application is received when it reaches the creditor, rather than when it reaches the agent or broker.\n\n[4.] 3. Denied or withdrawn application. The creditor may determine within the three-business-day period that the \napplication will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested, as, for example, when a consumer applies for a \ntype or amount of credit that the creditor does not offer, or the consumer's application cannot be approved for some \nother reason. In that case, or if the consumer withdraws the application within the three-business-day waiting \nperiod, the creditor need not make the disclosures under this section. If the creditor fails to provide early disclosures \nand the transaction is later consummated on the original terms, the creditor will be in violation of this provision. If, \nhowever, the consumer amends the application because of the creditor's unwillingness to approve it on its original \nterms, no violation occurs for not providing disclosures based on the original terms. But the amended application is \na new application subject to \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i).\n\n[5.] 4. Itemization of amount financed. In many mortgage transactions subject to RESPA, the itemization of the \namount financed required by [\u00a7 226.18(c)] \u00a7 226.38(j) will contain items, such as origination fees or points, that also \nmust be disclosed as part of the good faith estimates of settlement costs required under RESPA. Creditors \nfurnishing the RESPA good faith estimates need not give consumers any itemization of the amount financed, \nwhether or not a transaction is subject to RESPA.\n\n19(a)(1)(ii) Imposition of fees.\n\n1. Timing of fees. The consumer must receive the disclosures required by this section before paying or incurring \nany fee imposed by a creditor or other person in connection with the consumer's application for a mortgage \ntransaction that is subject to \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i), except as provided in \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(iii). If the creditor delivers the \ndisclosures to the consumer in person, a fee may be imposed anytime after delivery. If the creditor places the \ndisclosures in the mail, the creditor may impose a fee after the consumer receives the disclosures or, in all cases, \nafter midnight [on the third business day] following the third business day after mailing of the disclosures. Creditors \nthat use electronic mail or a courier to provide disclosures may also follow this approach. Whatever method is used \nto provide disclosures, creditors may rely on documentation of receipt in determining when a fee may be imposed. \nFor purposes of \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(ii), the term \"business day\" means all calendar days except Sundays and legal \npublic holidays referred to in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6). See [C]comment 2(a)(6)-2. For example, assuming that there are no \nintervening legal public holidays, a creditor that receives the consumer's written application on Monday and mails \nthe early mortgage loan disclosure on Tuesday may impose a fee on the consumer [after midnight on Friday] on \nSaturday.\n\n19(a)(2) Waiting period(s) required\n\n1. Business day definition. For purposes of \u00a7 226.19(a)(2), \"business day\" means all calendar days except Sundays \nand the legal public holidays referred to in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)-2.\n\n2. Consummation after [both] all waiting periods expire. Consummation may not occur until both the seven-\nbusiness-day waiting period and the three-business-day waiting period(s) have expired. For example, assume a \ncreditor delivers the early disclosures to the consumer in person or places them in the mail on Monday, June 1, and \nthe creditor then delivers [corrected] new disclosures in person to the consumer on Wednesday, June 3. Although \nSaturday,  June 6 is the third business day after the consumer received the [corrected] new disclosures, \n\n\n\nconsummation may not occur before Tuesday, June 9, the seventh business day following delivery or mailing of the \nearly disclosures.\n\n19(a)(2)(i) Seven-business-day waiting period.\n\n1. Timing. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i) must be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the \nseventh business day before consummation. The seven-business-day waiting period begins when the creditor \ndelivers the early disclosures or places them in the mail, not when the consumer receives or is deemed to have \nreceived the early disclosures. For example, if a creditor delivers the early disclosures to the consumer in person or \nplaces them in the mail on Monday, June 1, consummation may occur on or after Tuesday, June 9, the seventh \nbusiness day following delivery or mailing of the early disclosures.\n\n19(a)(2)(ii) Three-business-day waiting period.\n\n1. New disclosures in all cases. The creditor must provide new disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 so that the consumer \nreceives them not later than the third business day before consummation, even if the new disclosures are identical \nto the early disclosures provided under \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i).\n\n2. Content of disclosures. Disclosures made under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) must contain each of the applicable \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.38.\n\n3. Estimates. Section 226.19(a)(2)(ii) provides that only the disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(C), \n226.38(c)(3)(ii)(C), 226.38(c)(6)(i), and 226.38(e)(5)(i) may be estimated disclosures. Because estimated amounts \nof escrowed taxes and insurance premiums and mortgage insurance premiums disclosed (as applicable) under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.38(c)(3)(i)(C), 226.38(c)(3)(ii)(C), and 226.38(c)(6)(i) are components of the total periodic payments disclosure \nrequired by \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(D) and 226.38(c)(3)(ii)(D) and the total payments disclosure required by \u00a7 \n226.38(e)(5)(i), those disclosures are estimated disclosures. (A total payments disclosure is not required for loans \nwith a negative amortization feature subject to \u00a7 226.38(c)(6).) Creditors may estimate components of the total \nperiodic payments disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(C), 226.38(c)(3)(ii)(C) and 226.38(c)(6)(i) and the total \npayment disclosure required by \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) only to the extent the estimated escrowed amounts and mortgage \ninsurance premiums affect those disclosures.\n\n4. Timing. The creditor must provide final disclosures so that the consumer receives them not later than the third \nbusiness day before consummation. For example, for consummation to occur on Thursday, June 11, the consumer \nmust receive the disclosures on or before Monday, June 8.\n\nALTERNATIVE 1--PARAGRAPH 19(a)(2)(iii)\n\n19(a)(2)(iii) Corrected disclosures.\n\n1. Conditions for corrected disclosures. A disclosed annual percentage rate is accurate for purposes of \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2)(iii) if the disclosure is accurate under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv). If a change occurs that does not render the \nannual percentage rate inaccurate, the creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent \nwith \u00a7 226.17(f).\n\n2. Content of corrected disclosures. Disclosures made under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii) must contain each of the applicable \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.38.\n\n3. Estimates. In disclosures provided under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii), only the disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.38(c)(3)(i)(C), 226.38(c)(3)(ii)(C), 226.38(c)(6)(i) and 226.38(e)(5)(i) may be estimates. See comment \n19(a)(2)(ii)-3 for a discussion of which of the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.38 creditors may estimate.\n\n\n\n4. Timing. The creditor must provide the corrected disclosures so that the consumer receives them not later than \nthe third business day before consummation. For example, for consummation to occur on Saturday, June 13, the \nconsumer must receive the disclosures on or before Wednesday, June 10.\n\n[19(a)(2)(ii) Three-business-day waiting period.\n\n1. Conditions for redisclosure. If, at the time of consummation, the annual percentage rate disclosed is accurate \nunder \u00a7 226.22, the creditor does not have to make corrected disclosures under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). If, on the other \nhand, the annual percentage rate disclosed is not accurate under \u00a7 226.22, the creditor must make corrected \ndisclosures of all changed terms (including the annual percentage rate) so that the consumer receives them not \nlater than the third business day before consummation. For example, assume consummation is scheduled for \nThursday, June 11 and the early disclosures for a regular mortgage transaction disclose an annual percentage rate \nof 7.00%.\n\ni. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.10%. The creditor is not required to make corrected \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2).\n\nii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.15%. The creditor must make corrected disclosures \nso that the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.\n\n2. Content of new disclosures. If redisclosure is required, the creditor may provide a complete set of new \ndisclosures, or may redisclose only the changed terms. If the creditor chooses to provide a complete set of new \ndisclosures, the creditor may but need not highlight the new terms, provided that the disclosures comply with the \nformat requirements of \u00a7 226.17(a). If the new creditor chooses to disclose only the new terms, all the new terms \nmust be disclosed. For example, a different annual percentage rate will almost always produce a different finance \ncharge, and often a new schedule of payments; all of these changes would have to be disclosed. If, in addition, \nunrelated terms such as the amount financed or prepayment penalty vary from those originally disclosed, the \naccurate terms must be disclosed. However, no new disclosures are required if the only inaccuracies involve \nestimates other than the annual percentage rate, and no variable-rate feature has been added. See \u00a7 226.17(f). For \na discussion of the requirement to redisclose when a variable-rate feature is added, see comment 17(f)-2. For a \ndiscussion of redisclosure requirements in general, see the commentary on \u00a7 226.17(f).\n\n3. Timing. When redisclosures are necessary because the annual percentage rate has become inaccurate, they \nmust be received by the consumer no later than the third business day before consummation. (For redisclosures \ntriggered by other events, the creditor must provide corrected disclosures before consummation. See \u00a7 226.17(f).) If \nthe creditor delivers the corrected disclosures to the consumer in person, consummation may occur any time on the \nthird business day following delivery. If the creditor provides the corrected disclosures by mail, the consumer is \nconsidered to have received them three business days after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of determining \nwhen the three-business-day waiting period required under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) begins. Creditors that use electronic \nmail or a courier other than the postal service may also follow this approach.\n\n 4. Basis for annual percentage rate comparison. To determine whether a creditor must make corrected disclosures \nunder \u00a7 226.22, a creditor compares (a) what the annual percentage rate will be at consummation to (b) the annual \npercentage rate stated in the most recent disclosures the creditor made to the consumer. For example, assume \nconsummation for a regular mortgage transaction is scheduled for Thursday, June 11, the early disclosures \nprovided in May stated an annual percentage rate of 7.00%, and corrected disclosures received by the consumer \non Friday, June 5 stated an annual percentage rate of 7.15%:\n\n1. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.25%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed \nannual percentage rate by less than the applicable tolerance. The creditor is not required to make additional \ncorrected disclosures or wait an additional three business days under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2).\n\n\n\nii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.30%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed \nannual percentage rate by more than the applicable tolerance. The creditor must make corrected disclosures such \nthat the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.]\n\nALTERNATIVE 2-PARAGRAPH 19(a)(2)(iii)\n\n19(a)(2)(iii) Corrected disclosures.\n\n1. Conditions for corrected disclosures. If the annual percentage rate disclosed under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) changes so \nthat it is not accurate under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv) or an adjustable-rate feature is added (see comment 17(f)--2), the \ncreditor must make corrected disclosures of all changed terms (including the annual percentage rate) so that the \nconsumer receives them not later than the third business day before consummation. (If a change occurs that does \nnot render the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures inaccurate, the creditor must disclose the changed \nterms before consummation, consistent with \u00a7 226.17(f).) For example, assume consummation is scheduled for \nThursday, June 11 and the early disclosures for a regular mortgage transaction disclose an annual percentage rate \nof 7.00%:\n\n[19(a)(2)(ii) Three-business-day waiting period. 1. Conditions for redisclosure. If, at the time of consummation, the \nannual percentage rate disclosed is accurate under \u00a7 226.22, the creditor does not have to make corrected \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). If, on the other hand, the annual percentage rate disclosed is not accurate under \n\u00a7 226.22, the creditor must make corrected disclosures of all changed terms (including the annual percentage rate) \nso that the consumer receives them no later than the third business day before consummation. For example, \nassume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the early disclosures for a regular mortgage \ntransaction disclose an annual percentage rate of 7.00%:]\n\ni. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.10%. The creditor is not required to make corrected \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2).\n\nii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.15%. The creditor must make corrected disclosures \nso that the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.\n\n2. Content of [new] corrected disclosures. If redisclosure is required under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii), the creditor may \nprovide a complete set of new disclosures, or may redisclose only the changed terms. If the creditor chooses to \nprovide a complete set of new disclosures, the creditor may but need not highlight the new terms, provided that the \ndisclosures comply with the format requirements of \u00a7 226.17(a) and \u00a7 226.37. If the new creditor chooses to \ndisclose only the new terms, all the new terms must be disclosed. For example, a different annual percentage rate \nwill almost always produce [a different finance charge, and often a new schedule of payments] different interest and \nsettlement charges, and often a new payment summary; all of these changes would have to be disclosed. If, in \naddition, unrelated terms such as the amount financed or prepayment penalty vary from those originally disclosed \nor an adjustable-rate feature is added (see comment 17(f)--2), the accurate terms must be disclosed. [However, no \nnew disclosures are required if the only inaccuracies involve estimates other than the annual percentage rate, and \nno variable-rate feature has been added. For a discussion of the requirement to redisclose when a variable-rate \nfeature is added, see comment 17(f)--2. For a discussion of redisclosure requirements in general, see the \ncommentary on \u00a7 226.17(f).]\n\n[3. Timing. When redisclosures are necessary because the annual percentage rate has become inaccurate, they \nmust be received by the consumer no later than the third business day before consummation. (For redisclosures \ntriggered by other events, the creditor must provide corrected disclosures before consummation. See \u00a7 226.17(f).) If \nthe creditor delivers the corrected disclosures to the consumer in person, consummation may occur any time on the \nthird business day following delivery. If the creditor provides the corrected disclosures by mail, the consumer is \nconsidered to have received them three business days after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of determining \nwhen the three-business-day waiting periods required under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) begins. Creditors that use electronic \nmail or a courier other than the postal service may also follow this approach.]\n\n\n\n3. Estimates. In disclosures provided under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii), only the disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.38(c)(3)(i)(C), 226.38(c)(3)(ii)(C), 226.38(c)(6)(i) and 226.38(e)(5)(i) may be estimates. See comment \n19(a)(2)(ii)--3 for a discussion of which of the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.38 creditors may estimate.\n\n4. Basis for annual percentage rate comparison. To determine whether a creditor must make corrected disclosures \nunder [\u00a7 226.22] \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii), a creditor compares (a) what the annual percentage rate will be at \nconsummation to (b) the annual percentage rate stated in the most recent disclosures the creditor made to the \nconsumer. For example, assume consummation for a regular mortgage transaction is scheduled for Thursday, June \n11, the early disclosures provided in May stated an annual percentage rate of 7.00%, and [corrected] new \ndisclosures received by the consumer on Friday, June 5 stated an annual percentage rate of 7.15%:\n\ni. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.25%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed \nannual percentage rate by less than the applicable tolerance. The creditor is not required to make additional \ncorrected disclosures or wait an additional three business days under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2).\n\nii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.30%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed \nannual percentage rate by more than the applicable tolerance. The creditor must make corrected disclosures such \nthat the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.\n\n19(a)(2)(iv) Annual percentage rate accuracy.\n\n1. Other changed terms. If a change occurs that does not render the APR inaccurate under \u00a7 226.19(a)(iv), the \ncreditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent with \u00a7 226.17(f).\n\n19(a)(2)(v) Timing.\n\n1. General. If the creditor delivers the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii)  or (a)(2)(iii) to the consumer in \nperson, consummation may occur any time on the third business day following delivery. If the creditor provides the \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) or (a)(2)(iii) of this section by mail, the consumer is considered to have \nreceived them three business days after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of determining when the three-\nbusiness-day waiting periods required under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) begin. Creditors that use electronic mail or a \ncourier to provide disclosures may also follow this approach. Whatever method is used to provide disclosures, \ncreditors may rely on documentation of receipt in determining when the three-business-day waiting period begins.\n\n19(a)(3) Consumer's waiver of waiting period before consummation.\n\n1. Modification or waiver. A consumer may modify or waive the right to a waiting period required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) \nonly after the creditor makes the disclosures required by [\u00a7 226.18] \u00a7 226.38. A separate waiver is required for each \nwaiting period to be waived. The consumer must have a bona fide personal financial emergency that necessitates \nconsummating the credit transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether these conditions are met is \ndetermined by the facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure, \nwhere the foreclosure sale will proceed unless the loan proceeds are made available to the consumer during the \nwaiting period, is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer who is primarily liable \non the legal obligation must sign the written statement for the waiver to be effective.\n\n[2. Examples of waivers within the seven-business-day waiting period. Assume the early disclosures are delivered \nto the consumer in person on Monday, June 1, and at that time the consumer executes a waiver of the seven-\nbusiness-day waiting period (which would end on Tuesday, June 9) so that the loan can be consummated on \nFriday, June 5:\n\ni. If the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures is inaccurate under \u00a7 226.22, the creditor must provide a \ncorrected disclosure to the consumer before consummation, which triggers the three-business-day waiting period in \n\u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii). After the consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a waiver of the \nthree-business-day waiting period in order to consummate the transaction on Friday, June 5.\n\n\n\nii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures inaccurate under \u00a7 \n226.22, the creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent with \u00a7 226.17(f). Disclosure \nof the changed terms does not trigger the additional waiting period, and the transaction may be consummated on \nJune 5 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional modification or waiver.]\n\n[3. Examples of waivers made after the seven-business-day waiting period. Assume the early disclosures are \ndelivered to the consumer in person on Monday, June 1 and consummation is scheduled for Friday, June 19.] 2. \nExamples. Assume consummation is scheduled for Friday, June 19, the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i) \nare delivered to the consumer in person on Monday, June 1, and the consumer receives the disclosures required by \n\u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) on Monday, June 15. On Wednesday, June 17, a change in the annual percentage rate occurs:\n\ni. If the annual percentage rate on the [early] disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii) is [inaccurate under \u00a7 \n226.22] not accurate under \u00a7 226.22 nor accurate under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iv), the creditor must provide a corrected \ndisclosure before consummation, which triggers the three-business-day-waiting period in \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(iii). After \nthe consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a waiver of the three-business-day \nwaiting period in order to consummate the transaction on Friday, June 19.\n\nii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage rate on the [early] disclosures required by \u00a7 \n226.19(a)(2)(ii) inaccurate under \u00a7 226.22, the creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, \nconsistent with \u00a7 226.17(f). Disclosure of the changed terms does not trigger an additional waiting period, and the \ntransaction may be consummated on Friday, June 19 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional \nmodification or waiver.\n\n[19(a)(4) Notice.\n\n1. Inclusion in other disclosures. The notice required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(4) must be grouped together with the \ndisclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i) or \u00a7 226.19(a)(2). See comment 17(a)(1)-2 for a discussion of the rules for \nsegregating disclosures. In other cases, the notice set forth in \u00a7 226.19(a)(4) may be disclosed together with or \nseparately from the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.18. See comment 17(a)(1)-5(xvi).]\n\n19(a)[(5)] (4)(ii) Time of disclosures for timeshare plans.\n\n1. Timing. A mortgage transaction secured by a consumer's interest in a \"timeshare plan,\" as defined in 11 U.S.C. \n101(53D), [that is also a Federally related mortgage loan under RESPA] is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 \n226.19(a)[(5)](4) instead of the requirements of \u00a7 226.19(a)(1) through \u00a7 226.19(a)[(4)](3). See comment \n19(a)(1)(i)--1. Early disclosures for transactions subject to \u00a7 226.19(a)[(5)](4) must be given (a) before \nconsummation or (b) within three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application, \nwhichever is earlier. The general definition of \"business day\" in \u00a7 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the creditor's offices \nare open to the public for substantially all of its business functions--applies for purposes of \u00a7 226.19(a)(5)(ii). See \ncomment 2(a)(6)-1. These timing requirements are different from the timing requirements under \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i). \nTimeshare transactions covered by \u00a7 226.19(a)[(5)] may be consummated any time after the disclosures required \nby \u00a7 226.19(a)[(5)](4)(ii) are provided.\n\n2. Use of estimates. If the creditor does not know the precise credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures on \nthe best information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are estimates under \u00a7 226.17(c)(2). If \nmany of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as \"all numerical \ndisclosures [except the late-payment disclosure] are estimates\") instead of separately labelling each estimate. In \nthe alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items primarily affected by unknown information. (See \nthe commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning the estimates and the \ncontingencies that may affect the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(a)(1)[.] and \u00a7 \n226.37. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) may not contain estimates, however, with limited exceptions. \nSee the commentary on \u00a7 226.19(a)(2) for a discussion of limitations on estimates in disclosures made under that \nsubsection.\n\n\n\n3. Written application. For timeshare transactions, creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)-[3] 2 in determining \nwhether a \"written application\" has been received.\n\n4. Denied or withdrawn applications. For timeshare transactions, creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)--[4]3 in \ndetermining that disclosures are not required by \u00a7 226.19(a)[(5)](4)(ii) because the consumer's application will not \nor cannot be approved on the terms  requested or the consumer has withdrawn the application.\n\n5. Itemization of amount financed. For timeshare transactions, creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)--[5]4 in \ndetermining whether providing the good faith estimates of settlement costs required by RESPA satisfies the \nrequirement of \u00a7 226.18(c) to provide an itemization of the amount financed.\n\n19(a)[(5)](4)(iii) Redisclosure for timeshare plans.\n\n1. Consummation or settlement. For extensions of credit secured by a consumer's timeshare plan, when corrected \ndisclosures are required, they must be given no later than \"consummation or settlement.\" \"Consummation\" is \ndefined in \u00a7 226.2(a). \"Settlement\" is defined in Regulation X (24 CFR 3500.2(b)) and is subject to any \ninterpretations issued by HUD. In some cases, a creditor may delay redisclosure until settlement, which may be at a \ntime later than consummation. If a creditor chooses to redisclose at settlement, disclosures may be based on the \nterms in effect at settlement, rather than at consummation. For example, in a variable-rate transaction, a creditor \nmay choose to base disclosures on the terms in effect at settlement, despite the general rule in comment [17(c)(1)-\n8] \u00a7 226.17(c)(1)(iii) that variable-rate disclosures generally should be based on the terms in effect at \nconsummation.\n\n2. Content of new disclosures. Creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(2)(ii)--2 in determining the content of corrected \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.19(a)[(5)](4)(iii).\n\n19(b) [Certain variable-rate transactions] Adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\n[1. Coverage. Section 226.19(b) applies to all closed-end variable-rate transactions that are secured by the \nconsumer's principal dwelling and have a term greater than one year. The requirements of this section apply not \nonly to transactions financing the initial acquisition of the consumer's principal dwelling, but also to any other \nclosed-end variable-rate transaction secured by the principal dwelling. Closed-end variable-rate transactions that \nare not secured by the principal dwelling, or are secured by the principal dwelling but have a term of one year or \nless, are subject to the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.18(f)(1) rather than those of \u00a7 226.19(b). (Furthermore, \n\"shared-equity\" or \"shared-appreciation\" mortgages are subject to the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.18(f)(1) \nrather than those of \u00a7 226.19(b) regardless of the general coverage of those sections.) For purposes of this section, \nthe term of a variable-rate demand loan is determined in accordance with the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(5). In \ndetermining whether a construction loan that may be permanently financed by the same creditor is covered under \nthis section, the creditor may treat the construction and the permanent phases as separate transactions with distinct \nterms to maturity or a single combined transaction. For purposes of the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.18, the \ncreditor may nevertheless treat the two phases either as separate transactions or as a single combined transaction \nin accordance with \u00a7 226.17(c)(6). Finally, in any assumption of a variable-rate transaction secured by the \nconsumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year, disclosures need not be provided under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.18(f)(2)(ii) or 226.19(b).]\n\n1. Coverage. Section 226.19(b) applies to all closed-end adjustable-rate mortgages described in \u00a7 226.38(a)(i) that \nare secured by real property or a dwelling. Closed-end adjustable-rate transactions that are not secured by real \nproperty or a dwelling are subject to the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.18(f) rather than those of \u00a7 226.19(b). In \ndetermining whether a construction loan that may be permanently financed by the same creditor is covered under \nthis section, the creditor may treat the construction and the permanent phases as separate transactions with distinct \nterms to maturity or a single combined transaction. See comment 17(c)(6)-2. In any assumption of an adjustable-\nrate transaction secured by real property or a dwelling, disclosures need not be provided under \u00a7 226.19(b).\n\n\n\n[2. Timing. A creditor must give the disclosures required under this section at the time an application form is \nprovided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier.\n\ni. Intermediary agent or broker. In cases where a creditor receives a written application through an intermediary \nagent or broker, however, footnote 45b provides a substitute timing rule requiring the creditor to deliver the \ndisclosures or place them in the mail not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's \nwritten application. (See comment 19(b)--3 for guidance in determining whether or not the transaction involves an \nintermediary agent or broker.) This three-day rule also applies where the creditor takes an application over the \ntelephone.\n\nii. Telephone request. In cases where the consumer requests an application form over the telephone, the creditor \nmust include the early disclosures required under this section with the application that is sent to the consumer.\n\niii. Mail solicitations. In cases where the creditor solicits applications through the mail, the creditor must also send \nthe disclosures required under this section if an application form is included with the solicitation.\n\niv. Conversion.] 2. Disclosure at the time of conversion. In cases where an open-end credit account will convert to a \nclosed-end transaction subject to this section under a written agreement with the consumer, disclosures under this \nsection [may be given at the time of conversion.] must be given at or before the time of conversion. (See the \ncommentary to \u00a7 226.20(a) for information on the timing requirements for \u00a7 226.19(b)[(2)] disclosures when [a \nvariable-rate] an adjustable-rate feature is later added to a transaction.)\n\n[v. Form of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic applications. Creditors must provide the disclosures \nrequired by this section (including the brochure) on or with a blank application that is made available to the \nconsumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web site. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying this \nrequirement. Methods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are not limited to, the following \nexamples:\n\nA. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears;\n\nB. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application (whether or not they appear on the \ninitial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and \nindicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable;\n\nC. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on or with the application as long as consumers \ncannot bypass the disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the \ndisclosures, but the consumer need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or\n\nD. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the \ninitial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application.\n\nWhatever method is used, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the disclosures.\n\n3. Intermediary agent or broker. In certain transactions involving an \"intermediary agent or broker,\" a creditor may \ndelay providing disclosures. A creditor may not delay providing disclosures in transactions involving either a legal \nagent (as determined by applicable law) or any other third party that is not an \"intermediary agent or broker.\" In \ndetermining whether or not a transaction involves an \"intermediary agent or broker\" the following factors should be \nconsidered:\n\n. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of applications \nreceived by the creditor. The greater the percentage of total loan applications submitted by the broker in any given \nperiod of time, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an \"intermediary agent or broker\" of the \ncreditor during the next period.\n\n\n\n. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of applications \nreceived by the broker. (This factor is applicable only if the creditor has such information.) The greater the \npercentage of total loan applications received by the broker that is submitted to a creditor in any given period of \ntime, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an \"intermediary agent or broker\" of the creditor during \nthe next period.\n\n. The amount of work (such as document preparation) the creditor expects to be done by the broker on an \napplication based on the creditor's prior dealings with the broker and on the creditor's requirements for accepting \napplications, taking into consideration the customary practice of brokers in a particular area. The more work that the \ncreditor expects the broker to do on an application, in excess of what is usually expected of a broker in that area, \nthe less likely it is that the broker would be considered an \"intermediary agent or broker\" of the creditor. An example \nof an \"intermediary agent or broker\" is a broker who, customarily within a brief period of time after receiving an \napplication, inquires about the credit terms of several creditors with whom the broker does business and submits \nthe application to one of them. The broker is responsible for only a small percentage of the applications received by \nthat creditor. During the time the broker has the application, it might request a credit report and an appraisal (or \neven prepare an entire loan package if customary in that particular area).\n\n4. Other variable-rate regulations. Transactions in which the creditor is required to comply with and has complied \nwith the disclosure requirements of the variable-rate regulations of other Federal agencies are exempt from the \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.19(b), by virtue of footnote 45a, and are exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 226.20(c), by \nvirtue of footnote 45c. Those variable-rate regulations include the regulations issued by the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board and those issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The exception in footnotes \n45a and 45c is also available to creditors that are required by State law to comply with the federal variable-rate \nregulations noted above and to creditors that are authorized by title VIII of the Depository Institutions Act of 1982 \n(12 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.) to make loans in accordance with those regulations. Creditors using this exception should \ncomply with the timing requirements of those regulations rather than the timing requirements of Regulation Z in \nmaking the variable-rate disclosures.\n\n5. Examples of variable-rate transactions.\n\n(i) The following transactions, if they have a term greater than one year and are secured by the consumer's \nprincipal dwelling, constitute variable-rate mortgages subject to the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.19(b).]\n\n3. Non-adjustable-rate mortgages. The following transactions, if they are secured by real property or a dwelling, do \nnot constitute adjustable-rate mortgages subject to the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.19(b).\n\n[(A)] (i) Renewable balloon-payment instruments [where] that have a fixed rate of interest, even if the creditor is \nboth unconditionally obligated to renew the balloon-payment loan at the consumer's option (or is obligated to renew \nsubject to conditions within the consumer's control) and has the option of increasing the interest rate at the time of \nrenewal. (See comment [17(c)(1)-11] 17(c)(1)(iii)-4 for a discussion of conditions within a consumer's control in \nconnection with renewable balloon-payment loans.)\n\n[(B)] (ii) Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed \nbut will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the creditor, and \nthe note reflects the preferred rate. [The disclosures under \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b)(1) and 226.19(b)(2)(v), (viii), (ix), and (xii) \nare not applicable to such loans.]\n\n[(C)] (iii) \"Price-level-adjusted mortgages\" or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide \nfor periodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or \ninflation. [The disclosures under \u00a7 226.19(b)(1) are not applicable to such loans, nor are the following provisions to \nthe extent they relate to the determination of the interest rate by the addition of a margin, changes in the interest \nrate, or interest rate discounts: Section 226.19(b)(2)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), and (ix).] (See comments 20(c)-2 \nand 30-1 regarding the inapplicability of variable-rate adjustment notices and interest rate limitations to price-level-\nadjusted or similar mortgages.)\n\n\n\n[(ii)] (iv) Graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without an adjustable-rate feature. [a variable-\nrate feature are not considered variable-rate transactions].\n\n[Paragraph 19(b)(1).\n\n1. Substitute. Creditors who wish to use publications other than the Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate \nMortgages must make a good faith determination that their brochures are suitable substitutes to the Consumer \nHandbook. A substitute is suitable if it is, at a minimum, comparable to the Consumer Handbook in substance and \ncomprehensiveness. Creditors are permitted to provide more detailed information than is contained in the \nConsumer Handbook.\n\n2. Applicability. The Consumer Handbook need not be given for variable-rate transactions subject to this section in \nwhich the underlying interest rate is fixed. (See comment 19(b)-5 for an example of a variable-rate transaction \nwhere the underlying interest rate is fixed.)]\n\n[Paragraph 19(b)(2).\n\n1.] 4. Disclosure for each [variable] adjustable-rate mortgage program. A creditor must provide disclosures to the \nconsumer that [fully] describe each of the creditor's [variable] adjustable-rate mortgage programs in which the \nconsumer expresses an interest. If a program is made available only to certain customers of an institution, a \ncreditor need not provide disclosures for that program to other consumers who express a general interest in a \ncreditor's ARM programs. [Disclosures must be given at the time an application form is provided or before the \nconsumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. If program disclosures cannot be provided because a \nconsumer expresses an interest in individually negotiating loan terms that are not generally offered, disclosures \nreflecting those terms may be provided as soon as reasonably possible after the terms have been decided upon, \nbut not later than the time a non-refundable fee is paid. If a consumer who has received program disclosures \nsubsequently expresses an interest in other available variable-rate mortgage programs subject to 226.19(b)(2), or \nthe creditor and consumer decide on a program for which the consumer has not received disclosures, the creditor \nmust provide appropriate disclosures as soon as reasonably possible. The creditor, of course, is permitted to give \nthe consumer information about additional programs subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) initially.]\n\n[2. Variable-rate loan program disclosure defined.] 5. Adjustable-rate mortgage loan program defined. i.\n\nGenerally, if the identification, the presence or absence, or the exact value of a loan feature must be disclosed \nunder this section, [variable] adjustable-rate mortgage loans that differ as to such features constitute separate loan \nprograms. For example, separate loan programs would exist based on differences in any of the following loan \nfeatures:\n\nA. The index or other formula used to calculate interest rate adjustments.\n\nB. The rules relating to changes in the index value, interest rate, and payments[, and loan balance].\n\nC. The presence or absence of, and the amount of, rate or payment caps.\n\nD. The presence of a demand feature.\n\nE. The possibility of negative amortization.\n\nF. The possibility of interest rate carryover.\n\nG. The frequency of interest rate and payment adjustments.\n\nH. The presence of a discount or premium feature.\n\n\n\nI. [In addition, if a loan feature must be taken into account in preparing the disclosures required by \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2)(viii), variable-rate mortgage loans that differ as to that feature constitute separate programs under \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2).] The presence of a prepayment penalty provision.\n\nJ. The possibility of making interest-only payments.\n\nK. The presence of a balloon payment feature.\n\nL. The presence of a shared-equity or shared-appreciation feature.\n\nM. The possibility of providing less than full documentation of income or assets.\n\nN. The presence of a demand feature.\n\nii. If, however, [a representative value may be given for a loan feature or the feature need not be disclosed under \u00a7 \n226.19(b)(2), variable-rate] a feature is not required or permitted to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.19(b), adjustable-rate \nmortgage loans that differ as to such features do not constitute separate loan programs. For example, separate \nprograms would not exist based on differences in the following loan features:\n\nA. The amount of a discount or premium.\n\nB. The amount of a margin.\n\n[3. Form of program disclosures. A creditor may provide separate program disclosure forms for each ARM loan \nprogram it offers or a single disclosure form that describes multiple programs. A disclosure form may consist of \nmore than one page. For example, a creditor may attach a separate page containing the historical payment \nexample for a particular program. A disclosure form describing more than one program need not repeat information \napplicable to each program that is described. For example, a form describing multiple programs may disclose the \ninformation applicable to all of the programs in one place with the various program features (such as options \npermitting conversion to a fixed rate) disclosed separately. The form, however, must state if any program feature \nthat is described is available only in conjunction with certain other program features. Both the separate and multiple \nprogram disclosures may illustrate more than one loan maturity or payment amortization--for example, by including \nmultiple payment and loan balance columns in the historical payment example. Disclosures may be inserted or \nprinted in the Consumer Handbook (or a suitable substitute) as long as they are identified as the creditor's loan \nprogram disclosures.\n\n4. As applicable. The disclosures required by this section need only be made as applicable. Any disclosure not \nrelevant to a particular transaction may be eliminated. For example, if the transaction does not contain a demand \nfeature, the disclosure required under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(x) need not be given. As used in this section, payment refers \nonly to a payment based on the interest rate, loan balance and loan term, and does not refer to payment of other \nelements such as mortgage insurance premiums.]\n\n6. Payment. As used in this section, payment refers only to a payment based on the interest rate, loan balance and \nloan term, and does not refer to payment of other elements such as mortgage insurance premiums.\n\n[5.] 7. Revisions. A creditor must revise the disclosures required under this section [once a year] as soon as \nreasonably possible [after the new index value becomes available. Revisions to the disclosures also are required] \nwhen the loan program changes.\n\n[Paragraph 19(b)(2)(i).\n\n1. Change in interest rate, payment, or term. A creditor must disclose the fact that the terms of the legal obligation \npermit the creditor, after consummation of the transaction, to increase (or decrease) the interest rate, payment, or \nterm of the loan initially disclosed to the consumer. For example, the disclosures for a variable-rate mortgage loan \nprogram in which the interest rate and payment (but not loan term) can change might read, \"Your interest rate and \n\n\n\npayment can change yearly.\" In transactions where the term of the loan may change due to rate fluctuations, the \ncreditor must state that fact.\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(ii).\n\n1. Identification of index or formula. If a creditor ties interest rate changes to a particular index, this fact must be \ndisclosed, along with a source of information about the index. For example, if a creditor uses the weekly average \nyield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity as its index, the disclosure might read, \"Your \nindex is the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year published \nweekly in the Wall Street Journal.\" If no particular index is used, the creditor must briefly describe the formula used \nto calculate interest rate changes.\n\n2. Changes at creditor's discretion. If interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion, this fact must be \ndisclosed. If an index is internally defined, such as by a creditor's prime rate, the creditor should either briefly \ndescribe that index or state that interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion.\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(iii).\n\n1. Determination of interest rate and payment. This provision requires an explanation of how the creditor will \ndetermine the consumer's interest rate and payment. In cases where a creditor bases its interest rate on a specific \nindex and adjusts the index through the addition of a margin, for example, the disclosure might read, \"Your interest \nrate is based on the index plus a margin, and your payment will be based on the interest rate, loan balance, and \nremaining loan term.\" In transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fully amortize the outstanding \nbalance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining \nunpaid balance, the creditor must disclose this fact. For example, the disclosure might read, \"Your periodic \npayments will not fully amortize your loan and you will be required to make a single payment of the periodic \npayment plus the remaining unpaid balance at the end of the loan term.\" The creditor, however, need not reflect \nany irregular final payment in the historical example or in the disclosure of the initial and maximum rates and \npayments. If applicable, the creditor should also disclose that the rate and payment will be rounded.\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(iv).\n\n1. Current margin value and interest rate. Because the disclosures can be prepared in advance, the interest rate \nand margin may be several months old when the disclosures are delivered. A statement, therefore, is required \nalerting consumers to the fact that they should inquire about the current margin value applied to the index and the \ncurrent interest rate. For example, the disclosure might state, \"Ask us for our current interest rate and margin.\"]\n\n19(b)(1) Interest rate and payment disclosures\n\n1. As applicable. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b)(1) need only be made as applicable. Any disclosure not \nrelevant to a particular loan program may be omitted.\n\n[Paragraph 19(b)(2)(v).] Paragraph 19(b)(1)(i)\n\n1. Discounted and premium interest rate. In some [variable] adjustable-rate mortgage loan transactions, creditors \nmay set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate \nadjustments. Typically, this initial rate charged to consumers is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated \nusing the index or formula. However, in some cases the initial rate may be higher. If the initial interest rate will be a \ndiscount or a premium rate, creditors must alert the consumer to this fact. For example, if a creditor discounted a \nconsumer's initial rate, the disclosure might state, [\"Your initial interest rate is not based on the index used to make \nlater adjustments.\"] \"The interest rate is discounted and will stay the same for a 5-year introductory period. After this \ninitial period, the interest rate will increase, even if market rates do not change.\" (See the commentary to \u00a7 \n226.17(c)(1) for a further discussion of discounted and premium variable-rate transactions.) [In addition, the \ndisclosure must suggest that consumers inquire about the amount that the program is currently discounted. For \n\n\n\nexample, the disclosure might state, \"Ask us for the amount our adjustable rate mortgages are currently \ndiscounted.\"] In a transaction with a consumer buydown or with a third-party buydown that will be incorporated in \nthe legal obligation, the creditor should disclose the program as a discounted [variable] adjustable-rate mortgage \ntransaction, but need not disclose additional information regarding the buydown in its program disclosures. [(See \nthe commentary to \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii) for a discussion of how to reflect the discount or premium in the historical \nexample or the maximum rate and payment disclosure).]\n\n[Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vi)] Paragraph 19(b)(1)(ii).\n\n1. Frequency. The frequency of interest rate and payment adjustments must be disclosed. If interest rate changes \nwill be imposed more frequently or at different intervals than payment changes, a creditor must disclose the \nfrequency and timing of both types of changes. For example, in [a variable] an adjustable-rate mortgage transaction \nwhere interest rate changes are made monthly, but payment changes occur on an annual basis, this fact must be \ndisclosed. In certain ARM transactions, the interval between loan closing and the initial adjustment is not known and \nmay be different than the regular interval for adjustments. In such cases, the creditor may disclose the initial \nadjustment period as a range of the minimum and maximum amount of time from consummation or closing. For \nexample, the creditor might state: \"The first adjustment to your interest rate and payment will occur no sooner than \n6 months and no later than 18 months after closing. Subsequent adjustments may occur once each year after the \nfirst adjustment.\" [(See comments 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-7 and 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-4 for guidance on other disclosures when \nthis alternative disclosure rule is used.)]\n\nParagraph 19(b)(1)(iii).\n\n1. Identification of index or formula. If a creditor ties interest rate changes to a particular index, this fact must be \ndisclosed, along with a source of information about the index. If no particular index is used, the creditor must briefly \ndescribe the formula used to calculate interest rate changes. To describe the index used, the disclosure might state, \nfor example:\n\ni. \"Your interest rate will be based on the '1-year CMT' (Constant Maturity Treasury) index plus a margin we \ndetermine upon application. That index is published weekly in the Wall Street Journal and is available on the Web \nsite of the Federal Reserve Board.\"\n\nii. \"Your interest rate is based on the 1-year LIBOR Index plus a margin that is determined at application. This index \nis published daily in the Wall Street Journal.\"\n\niii. \"The interest rate is based on the 11th District COFI Index (Cost of Funds Index for 11th District Federal Home \nLoan Bank (FHLB)) plus a margin determined upon application. The 11th District COFI Index is published monthly \non the Web site of the San Francisco FHLB.\"\n\n2. Changes at creditor's discretion. If interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion, this fact must be \ndisclosed. If an index is internally defined, such as by a creditor's prime rate, the creditor should either briefly \ndescribe that index or state that interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion.\n\n[Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vii)] Paragraph 19(b)(1)(iv).\n\n1. Rate and payment caps. The creditor must disclose limits on changes (increases or decreases) in the interest \nrate or payment. If an initial discount is not taken into account in applying overall or periodic rate limitations, that fact \nmust be disclosed. If separate overall or periodic limitations apply to interest rate increases resulting from other \nevents, such as [the exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option or] leaving the creditor's employ, those limitations \nmust also be stated. If separate overall periodic limitations apply to interest rate increases resulting from the \nconsumer's exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option, those limitations must be stated with the disclosures about \nthe option required by \u00a7 226.19(b)(1)(v). Limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings \nunder State or Federal statutes or regulations. (See \u00a7 226.30 for the rule requiring that a maximum interest rate be \nincluded in certain [variable] adjustable-rate mortgage transactions.) The creditor need not disclose each periodic or \n\n\n\noverall rate limitation that is currently available. As an alternative, the creditor may disclose the range of the lowest \nand highest periodic and overall rate limitations that may be applicable to the creditor's ARM transactions. For \nexample, the creditor might state: \"Your interest rate can increase between 1 and 2 percentage points in any one \nyear and between 4 and 7 percentage points over the life of the loan. [\"The limitation on increases to your interest \nrate at each adjustment will be set at an amount in the following range: Between 1 and 2 percentage points at each \nadjustment. The limitation on increases to your interest rate over the term of the loan will be set at an amount in the \nfollowing range: Between 4 and 7 percentage points above the initial interest rate.\" A creditor using this alternative \nrule must include a statement in its program disclosures suggesting that the consumer ask about the overall rate \nlimitations currently offered for the creditor's ARM loan programs. (See comments 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)--6 and \n19(b)(2)(viii)(B)--3 for an explanation of the additional requirements for a creditor using this alternative rule for \ndisclosure of periodic and overall rate limitations.)\n\n2. Negative amortization and interest rate carryover. A creditor must disclose, where applicable, the possibility of \nnegative amortization. For example, the disclosure might state, \"If any of your payments is not sufficient to cover \nthe interest due, the difference will be added to your loan amount.\" Loans that provide for more than one way to \ntrigger negative amortization are separate variable-rate mortgage programs requiring separate disclosures. (See \nthe commentary to \u00a7 226.19(b)(2) for a discussion on the definition of a variable-rate mortgage loan program and \nthe format for disclosure.) If a consumer is given the option to cap monthly payments that may result in negative \namortization, the creditor must fully disclose the rules relating to the option, including the effects of exercising the \noption (such as negative amortization will occur and the principal loan balance will increase); however, the \ndisclosure in \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii) need not be provided.\n\n3. Conversion option. If a loan program permits consumers to convert their variable-rate mortgage loans to fixed-\nrate loans, the creditor must disclose that the interest rate may increase if the consumer converts the loan to a \nfixed-rate loan. The creditor must also disclose the rules relating to the conversion feature, such as the period \nduring which the loan may be converted, that fees may be charged at conversion, and how the fixed rate will be \ndetermined. The creditor should identify any index or other measure or formula used to determine the fixed rate and \nstate any margin to be added. In disclosing the period during which the loan may be converted and the margin, the \ncreditor may use information applicable to the conversion feature during the six months preceding preparation of \nthe disclosures and state that the information is representative of conversion features recently offered by the \ncreditor. The information may be used until the program disclosures are otherwise revised. Although the rules \nrelating to the conversion option must be disclosed, the effect of exercising the option should not be reflected \nelsewhere in the disclosures, such as in the historical example or in the calculation of the initial and maximum \ninterest rate and payments.\n\n4. Preferred-rate loans. Section 226.19(b) applies to preferred-rate loans, where the rate will increase upon the \noccurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the creditor's employ, whether or not the underlying rate is \nfixed or variable. In these transactions, the creditor must disclose the event that would allow the creditor to increase \nthe rate such as that the rate may increase if the employee leaves the creditor's employ. The creditor must also \ndisclose the rules relating to termination of the preferred rate, such as that fees may be charged when the rate is \nchanged and how the new rate will be determined.\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(viii).\n\n1. Historical example and initial and maximum interest rates and payments. A creditor may disclose both the \nhistorical example and the initial and maximum interest rates and payments.\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(viii)(A).\n\n1. Index movement. This section requires a creditor to provide an historical example, based on a $ 10,000 loan \namount originating in 1977, showing how interest rate changes implemented according to the terms of the loan \nprogram would have affected payments and the loan balance at the end of each year during a 15-year period. (In all \ncases, the creditor need only calculate the payments and loan balance for the term of the loan. For example, in a \n\n\n\nfive-year loan, a creditor would show the payments and loan balance for the five-year term, from 1977 to 1981, with \na zero loan balance reflected for 1981. For the remaining ten years, 1982-1991, the creditor need only show the \nremaining index values, margin and interest rate and must continue to reflect all significant loan program terms \nsuch as rate limitations affecting them.) Pursuant to this section, the creditor must provide a history of index values \nfor the preceding 15 years. Initially, the disclosures would give the index values from 1977 to the present. Each year \nthereafter, the revised program disclosures should include an additional year's index value until 15 years of values \nare shown. If the values for an index have not been available for 15 years, a creditor need only go back as far as \nthe values are available in giving a history and payment example. In all cases, only one index value per year need \nbe shown. Thus, in transactions where interest rate adjustments are implemented more frequently than once per \nyear, a creditor may assume that the interest rate and payment resulting from the index value chosen will stay in \neffect for the entire year for purposes of calculating the loan balance as of the end of the year and for reflecting \nother loan program terms. In cases where interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion (see the commentary \nto \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)), the creditor must provide a history of the rates imposed for the preceding 15 years, beginning \nwith the rates in 1977. In giving this history, the creditor need only go back as far as the creditor's rates can \nreasonably be determined.\n\n2. Selection of index values. The historical example must reflect the method by which index values are determined \nunder the program. If a creditor uses an average of index values or any other index formula, the history given \nshould reflect those values. The creditor should select one date or, when an average of single values is used as an \nindex, one period and should base the example on index values measured as of that same date or period for each \nyear shown in the history. A date or period at any time during the year may be selected, but the same date or \nperiod must be used for each year in the historical example. For example, a creditor could use values for the first \nbusiness day in July or for the first week ending in July for each of the 15 years shown in the example.\n\n3. Selection of margin. For purposes of the disclosure required under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor may select a \nrepresentative margin that has been used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and \nshould disclose that the margin is one that the creditor has used recently. The margin selected may be used until a \ncreditor revises the disclosure form.\n\n4. Amount of discount or premium. For purposes of the disclosure required under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor \nmay select a discount or premium (amount and term) that has been used during the six months preceding \npreparation of the disclosures, and should disclose that the discount or premium is one that the creditor has used \nrecently. The discount or premium should be reflected in the historical example for as long as the discount or \npremium is in effect. A creditor may assume that a discount that would have been in effect for any part of a year \nwas in effect for the full year for purposes of reflecting it in the historical example. For example, a 3-month discount \nmay be treated as being in effect for the entire first year of the example; a 15-month discount may be treated as \nbeing in effect for the first two years of the example. In illustrating the effect of the discount or premium, creditors \nshould adjust the value of the interest rate in the historical example, and should not adjust the margin or index \nvalues. For example, if during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures the fully indexed rate would \nhave been 10% but the first year's rate under the program was 8%, the creditor would discount the first interest rate \nin the historical example by 2 percentage points.\n\n5. Term of the loan. In calculating the payments and loan balances in the historical example, a creditor need not \nbase the disclosures on each term to maturity or payment amortization that it offers. Instead, disclosures for ARMs \nmay be based upon terms to maturity or payment amortizations of 5, 15 and 30 years, as follows: ARMs with terms \nor amortizations from over 1 year to 10 years may be based on a 5-year term or amortization; ARMs with terms or \namortizations from over 10 years to 20 years may be based on a 15-year term or amortization; and ARMs with \nterms or amortizations over 20 years may be based on a 30-year term or amortization. Thus, disclosures for ARMs \noffered with any term from over 1 year to 40 years may be based solely on terms of 5, 15 and 30 years. Of course, \na creditor may always base the disclosures on the actual terms or amortizations offered. If the creditor bases the \ndisclosures on 5-, 15- or 30-year terms or payment amortization as provided above, the term or payment \namortization used in making the disclosure must be stated.\n\n\n\n6. Rate caps. A creditor using the alternative rule described in comment 19(b)(2)(vii)--1 for disclosure of rate \nlimitations must base the historical example upon the highest periodic and overall rate limitations disclosed under \nsection 226.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the creditor must state the limitations used in the historical example. (See \ncomment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)--3 for an explanation of the use of the highest rate limitation in other disclosures.)\n\n7. Frequency of adjustments. In certain transactions, creditors may use the alternative rule described in comment \n19(b)(2)(vi)--1 for disclosure of the frequency of rate and payment adjustments. In such cases, the creditor may \nassume for purposes of the historical example that the first adjustment occurred at the end of the first full year in \nwhich the adjustment could occur. For example, in an ARM in which the first adjustment may occur between 6 and \n18 months after closing and annually thereafter, the creditor may assume that the first adjustment occurred at the \nend of the first year in the historical example. (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)--4 for an explanation of how to \ncompute the maximum interest rate and payment when the initial adjustment period is not known.)\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(viii)(B).\n\n1. Initial and maximum interest rates and payments. The disclosure form must state the initial and maximum interest \nrates and payments for a $ 10,000 loan originated at an initial interest rate (index value plus margin adjusted by the \namount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an identified month and year for the loan program disclosure. \n(See comment 19(b)(2)-5 on revisions to the loan program disclosure.) In calculating the maximum payment under \nthis paragraph, a creditor should assume that the interest rate increases as rapidly as possible under the loan \nprogram, and the maximum payment disclosed should reflect the amortization of the loan during this period. Thus, \nin a loan with 2 percentage point annual (and 5 percentage point overall) interest rate limitations or \"caps,\" the \nmaximum interest rate would be 5 percentage points higher than the initial interest rate disclosed. Moreover, the \nloan would not reach the maximum interest rate until the fourth year because of the 2 percentage point annual rate \nlimitations, and the maximum payment disclosed would reflect the amortization of the loan during this period. If the \nloan program includes a discounted or premium initial interest rate, the initial interest rate should be adjusted by the \namount of the discount or premium.\n\n2. Term of the loan. In calculating the initial and maximum payments, the creditor need not base the disclosures on \neach term to maturity or payment amortization offered under the program. Instead, the creditor may follow the rules \nset out in comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)--5. If a historical example is provided under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), the terms to \nmaturity or payment amortization used in the historical example must be used in calculating the initial and maximum \npayment. In addition, creditors must state the term or payment amortization used in making the disclosures under \nthis section.\n\n3. Rate caps. A creditor using the alternative rule for disclosure of interest rate limitations described in comment \n19(b)(2)(vii)--1 must calculate the maximum interest rate and payment based upon the highest periodic and overall \nrate limitations disclosed under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the creditor must state the rate limitations used in \ncalculating the maximum interest rate and payment. (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)--6 for an explanation of the use \nof the highest rate limitation in other disclosures.)\n\n4. Frequency of adjustments. In certain transactions, a creditor may use the alternative rule for disclosure of the \nfrequency of rate and payment adjustments described in comment 19(b)(2)(vi)--1. In such cases, the creditor must \nbase the calculations of the initial and maximum rates and payments upon the earliest possible first adjustment \ndisclosed under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(vi). (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)--7 for an explanation of how to disclose the \nhistorical example when the initial adjustment period is not known.)\n\n5. Periodic payment statement. The statement that the periodic payment may increase or decrease substantially \nmay be satisfied by the disclosure in paragraph 19(b)(2)(vi) if it states for example, \"your monthly payment can \nincrease or decrease substantially based on annual changes in the interest rate.\"\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(ix).\n\n\n\n1. Calculation of payments. A creditor is required to include a statement on the disclosure form that explains how a \nconsumer may calculate his or her actual monthly payments for a loan amount other than $ 10,000. The example \nshould be based upon the most recent payment shown in the historical example or upon the initial interest rate \nreflected in the maximum rate and payment disclosure. In transactions in which the latest payment shown in the \nhistorical example is not for the latest year of index values shown (such as in a five-year loan), a creditor may \nprovide additional examples based on the initial and maximum payments disclosed under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(B). \nThe creditor, however, is not required to calculate the consumer's payments. (See the model clauses in appendix \nH--4(C).)\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(x).\n\n1. Demand feature. If a variable-rate mortgage loan subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) requirements contains a demand feature \nas discussed in the commentary to \u00a7 226.18(i), this fact must be disclosed. (Pursuant to \u00a7 226.18(i), creditors would \nalso disclose the demand feature in the standard disclosures given later.)\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(xi).\n\n1. Adjustment notices. A creditor must disclose to the consumer the type of information that will be contained in \nsubsequent notices of adjustments and when such notices will be provided. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.20(c) \nregarding notices of adjustments.) For example, the disclosure might state, \"You will be notified at least 25, but no \nmore than 120, days before the due date of a payment at a new level. This notice will contain information about the \nindex and interest rates, payment amount, and loan balance.\" In transactions where there may be interest rate \nadjustments without accompanying payment adjustments in a year, the disclosure might read, \"You will be notified \nonce each year during which interest rate adjustments, but no payment adjustments, have been made to your loan. \nThis notice will contain information about the index and interest rates, payment amount, and loan balance.\"\n\nParagraph 19(b)(2)(xii).\n\n1. Multiple loan programs. A creditor that offers multiple variable-rate mortgage loan programs is required to have \ndisclosures for each variable-rate mortgage loan program subject to \u00a7 226.19(b)(2). Unless disclosures for all of its \nvariable-rate programs are provided initially, the creditor must inform the consumer that other closed-end variable-\nrate programs exist, and that disclosure forms are available for these additional loan programs. For example, the \ndisclosure form might state, \"Information on other adjustable rate mortgage programs is available upon request.\"]\n\n19(b)(2) Key questions about risk.\n\n19(b)(2)(i) Required disclosures.\n\n1. Disclosure of first rate or payment increase. The requirement under \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(i)(A) and (B) to disclose when \nthe first interest rate or payment increase may occur refers to the time period in which the increase may occur, not \nthe exact calendar date. For example, the disclosure may state, \"Your interest rate may increase at the end of the \n3-year introductory period.\"\n\n19(b)(2)(i)(C) Prepayment penalty as risk factor.\n\n1. Coverage. See comment 38(a)(5)-1 to determine whether there is a prepayment penalty.\n\n2. Penalty. See comment 38(a)(5)-2 for examples of charges that are prepayment penalties.\n\n3. Not penalty. See comment 38(a)(5)-3 for examples of charges that are not prepayment penalties.\n\n19(b)(2)(ii) Additional disclosures.\n\n1. As applicable. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii) need only be made as applicable. Any disclosure \nnot relevant to a particular loan program may be omitted.\n\n\n\n19(b)(2)(ii)(C) Balloon payment.\n\n1. Coverage. The creditor must make the disclosure required by \u00a7 226.19(b)(ii)(B) if the loan program includes a \npayment schedule with regular periodic payments that when aggregated do not fully amortize the outstanding \nprincipal balance.\n\n2. Time period. The requirement to disclose when the balloon payment is due refers to the time period when it is \ndue, not the exact calendar date. For example, the disclosure may state, \"You would owe a balloon payment due in \nseven years.\"\n\n19(b)(2)(ii)(D) Demand feature.\n\n1. Disclosure requirements. The disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(ii)(D) apply not only to transactions \npayable on demand from the outset, but also to transactions that convert to a demand status after a stated period.\n\n2. Covered demand features. See comment 18(i)-2 for examples of covered demand features.\n\n19(c) Conversion to closed-end credit.\n\n1. Disclosure at the time of conversion. In cases where an open-end credit account will convert to a closed-end \ntransaction under a written agreement with the consumer, disclosures are not required under \u00a7 226.19(c). By \ncontrast, disclosures are required in such cases under \u00a7 226.19(b). See comment 19(b)--2.\n\n19(d) Timing of disclosures.\n\n19(d)(1) General timing.\n\n1. Oral application. Creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X (including any interpretations issued by HUD) in \ndeciding whether they have made a written record of a consumer's oral application, even for a transaction not \nsubject to RESPA. In general, Regulation X defines \"application\" to mean the submission of a borrower's financial \ninformation in anticipation of a credit decision relating to a federally related mortgage loan and states that an \napplication may either be in writing or electronically submitted, including a written record of an oral application. See \n24 CFR 3500.2(b).\n\n[19(c)] 19(d)(2) Electronic disclosures.\n\nParagraph 19(d)(2)(i).\n\n[1. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic form depends upon the following:]\n\n[i.] 1. Electronic disclosures required. If a consumer accesses [an ARM] a loan application electronically (other than \nas described under [ii. below] \u00a7 226.19(d)(ii)), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the \ndisclosures in electronic form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to \nprovide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to \nthe consumer, this requirement would not be met.\n\n2. Timing of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic applications. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying \nthe requirement under \u00a7 226.19(d) (subject to \u00a7 226.19(d)(1)(ii)) to provide disclosures required by \u00a7 226.19(b) and \n(c) in electronic form if a consumer accesses an application electronically. Methods creditors could use to satisfy \nthe requirement include, but are not limited to, the following examples:\n\ni. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears;\n\nii. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application (whether or not they appear on the \ninitial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and \nindicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable;\n\n\n\niii. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on or with the application as long as consumers \ncannot bypass the disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the \ndisclosures, but the consumer need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or\n\niv. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the \ninitial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application.\n\nParagraph 19(d)(2)(ii)\n\n[ii. In contrast, if] 1. Electronic disclosures optional. If a consumer is physically present in the creditor's office, and \naccesses an ARM loan application electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal \nor kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide \napplications to consumers), the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the \ncreditor complies with the timing, delivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.\n\nParagraph 19(d)(3)\n\n1. Telephone request. Where a creditor takes a written application by telephone, the creditor must deliver the \ndisclosures or place them in the mail not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's \nwritten application. In cases where the consumer only requests an application over the telephone, the creditor must \ninclude the early disclosures required under this section with the application that is sent to the consumer.\n\n2. Mail solicitations. In cases where the creditor solicits applications through the mail, the creditor must also send \nthe disclosures required under \u00a7 226.19(b) and (c) if an application form is included with the solicitation.\n\n3. Intermediary agent or broker. i. Where a creditor receives a written application through an intermediary agent or \nbroker the creditor must deliver the disclosures or place them in the mail not later than three business days after the \ncreditor receives the consumer's written application. However, a creditor must provide disclosures at the time an \napplication form is provided or the consumer pays a non-refundable fee, whichever is earlier, in a transaction that \ninvolves a legal agent, as determined under applicable law, or any other third party that is not an \"intermediary \nagent or broker.\" In determining whether or not a transaction involves an \"intermediary agent or broker\" the creditor \nshould consider the following factors:\n\nA. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of \napplications received by the creditor. The greater the percentage of total loan applications submitted by the broker \nin any given period of time, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an \"intermediary agent or broker\" \nof the creditor during the next period.\n\nB. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of \napplications received by the broker. (This factor is applicable only if the creditor has such information.) The greater \nthe percentage of total loan applications received by the broker that is submitted to a creditor in any given period of \ntime, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an \"intermediary agent or broker\" of the creditor during \nthe next period.\n\nC. The amount of work (such as document preparation) the creditor expects to be done by the broker on an \napplication based on the creditor's prior dealings with the broker and on the creditor's requirements for accepting \napplications, taking into consideration the customary practice of brokers in a particular area. The more work that the \ncreditor expects the broker to do on an application, in excess of what is usually expected of a broker in that area, \nthe less likely it is that the broker would be considered an \"intermediary agent or broker\" of the creditor.\n\nii. An example of an \"intermediary agent or broker\" is a broker who, customarily within a brief period of time after \nreceiving an application, inquires about the credit terms of several creditors with whom the broker does business \nand submits the application to one of them. The broker is responsible for only a small percentage of the applications \n\n\n\nreceived by that creditor. During the time the broker has the application, it might request a credit report and an \nappraisal (or even prepare an entire loan package if customary in that particular area).\n\n\u00a7 226.20--Subsequent Disclosure Requirements.\n\n20(a) Refinancings.\n\n1. Definition. A refinancing is a new transaction requiring a complete new set of disclosures. Whether a refinancing \nhas occurred is determined by reference to whether the original obligation has been satisfied or extinguished and \nreplaced by a new obligation, based on the parties' contract and applicable law. The refinancing may involve the \nconsolidation of several existing obligations, disbursement of new money to the consumer or on the consumer's \nbehalf, or the rescheduling of payments under an existing obligation. In any form, the new obligation must \ncompletely replace the prior one.\n\ni. Changes in the terms of an existing obligation, such as the deferral of individual installments, will not constitute a \nrefinancing unless accomplished by the cancellation of that obligation and the substitution of a new obligation.\n\nii. A substitution of agreements that meets the refinancing definition will require new disclosures, even if the \nsubstitution does not substantially alter the prior credit terms.\n\n2. Exceptions. A transaction is subject to \u00a7 226.20(a) only if it meets the general definition of a refinancing. Section \n226.20(a) (1) through (5) lists 5 events that are not treated as refinancings, even if they are accomplished by \ncancellation of the old obligation and substitution of a new one.\n\n3. Variable-rate. i. If a variable-rate feature was properly disclosed under the regulation, a rate change in accord \nwith those disclosures is not a refinancing. For example, no new disclosures are required when the variable-rate \nfeature is invoked on a renewable balloon-payment mortgage that was previously disclosed as a variable-rate \ntransaction.\n\nii. Even if it is not accomplished by the cancellation of the old obligation and substitution of a new one, a new \ntransaction subject to new disclosures results if the creditor either:\n\nA. Increases the rate based on a variable-rate feature that was not previously disclosed; or\n\nB. Adds a variable-rate feature to the obligation. A creditor does not add a variable-rate feature by changing the \nindex of a variable-rate transaction to a comparable index, whether the change replaces the existing index or \nsubstitutes an index for one that no longer exists.\n\niii. If either of the events in paragraph 20(a)3.ii.A. or ii.B. occurs in a transaction secured by a principal dwelling with \na term longer than one year, the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.19(b) also must be given at that time.\n\n4. Unearned finance charge. In a transaction involving precomputed finance charges, the creditor must include in \nthe finance charge on the refinanced obligation any unearned portion of the original finance charge that is not \nrebated to the consumer or credited against the underlying obligation. For example, in a transaction with an add-on \nfinance charge, a creditor advances new money to a consumer in a fashion that extinguishes the original obligation \nand replaces it with a new one. The creditor neither refunds the unearned finance charge on the original obligation \nto the consumer nor credits it to the remaining balance on the old obligation. Under these circumstances, the \nunearned finance charge must be included in the finance charge on the new obligation and reflected in the annual \npercentage rate disclosed on refinancing. Accrued but unpaid finance charges are included in the amount financed \nin the new obligation.\n\n5. Coverage. Section 226.20(a) applies only to refinancings undertaken by the original creditor or a holder or \nservicer of the original obligation. A \"refinancing\" by any other person is a new transaction under the regulation, not \na refinancing under this section.\n\n\n\nParagraph 20(a)(1).\n\n1. Renewal. This exception applies both to obligations with a single payment of principal and interest and to \nobligations with periodic payments of interest and a final payment of principal. In determining whether a new \nobligation replacing an old one is a renewal of the original terms or a refinancing, the creditor may consider it a \nrenewal even if:\n\ni. Accrued unpaid interest is added to the principal balance.\n\nii. Changes are made in the terms of renewal resulting from the factors listed in \u00a7 226.17(c)(3).\n\niii. The principal at renewal is reduced by a curtailment of the obligation.\n\nParagraph 20(a)(2).\n\n1. Annual percentage rate reduction. A reduction in the annual percentage rate with a corresponding change in the \npayment schedule is not a refinancing. If the annual percentage rate is subsequently increased (even though it \nremains below its original level) and the increase is effected in such a way that the old obligation is satisfied and \nreplaced, new disclosures must then be made.\n\n2. Corresponding change. A corresponding change in the payment schedule to implement a lower annual \npercentage rate would be a shortening of the maturity, or a reduction in the payment amount or the number of \npayments of an obligation. The exception in \u00a7 226.20(a)(2) does not apply if the maturity is lengthened, or if the \npayment amount or number of payments is increased beyond that remaining on the existing transaction.\n\nParagraph 20(a)(3).\n\n1. Court agreements. This exception includes, for example, agreements such as reaffirmations of debts discharged \nin bankruptcy, settlement agreements, and post-judgment agreements. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.2(a)(14) for a \ndiscussion of court-approved agreements that are not considered \"credit.\")\n\nParagraph 20(a)(4).\n\n1. Workout agreements. A workout agreement is not a refinancing unless the annual percentage rate is increased \nor additional credit is advanced beyond amounts already accrued plus insurance premiums.\n\nParagraph 20(a)(5).\n\n1. Insurance renewal. The renewal of optional insurance added to an existing credit transaction is not a refinancing, \nassuming that appropriate Truth in Lending disclosures were provided for the initial purchase of the insurance.\n\n20(b) Assumptions.\n\n1. General definition. An assumption as defined in \u00a7 226.20(b) is a new transaction and new disclosures must be \nmade to the subsequent consumer. An assumption under the regulation requires the following three elements:\n\ni. [A residential mortgage transaction.] A closed-end credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.\n\nii. An express acceptance of the subsequent consumer by the creditor.\n\niii. A written agreement.\n\nThe assumption of a nonexempt consumer credit obligation requires no disclosures unless all three elements are \npresent. For example, an automobile dealer need not provide Truth in Lending disclosures to a customer who \nassumes an existing obligation secured by an automobile. However, [a residential mortgage transaction] closed-end \ncredit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling with the elements described in \u00a7 226.20(b) is an \n\n\n\nassumption that calls for new disclosures; the disclosures must be given whether or not the assumption is \naccompanied by changes in the terms of the obligation. [(See comment 2(a)(24)-5 for a discussion of assumptions \nthat are not considered residential mortgage transactions.)]\n\n[2. Existing residential mortgage transaction. A transaction may be a residential mortgage transaction as to one \nconsumer and not to the other consumer. In that case, the creditor must look to the assuming consumer in \ndetermining whether a residential mortgage transaction exists. To illustrate:\n\ni. The original consumer obtained a mortgage to purchase a home for vacation purposes. The loan was not a \nresidential mortgage transaction as to that consumer. The mortgage is assumed by a consumer who will use the \nhome as a principal dwelling. As to that consumer, the loan is a residential mortgage transaction. For purposes of \u00a7 \n226.20(b), the assumed loan is an \"existing residential mortgage transaction\" requiring disclosures, if the other \ncriteria for an assumption are met.]\n\n[3.] 2. Express agreement. Expressly agrees means that the creditor's agreement must relate specifically to the new \ndebtor and must unequivocally accept that debtor as a primary obligor. The following events are not construed to be \nexpress agreements between the creditor and the subsequent consumer:\n\ni. Approval of creditworthiness.\n\nii. Notification of a change in records.\n\niii. Mailing of a coupon book to the subsequent consumer.\n\niv. Acceptance of payments from the new consumer.\n\n[4.] 3. Retention of original consumer. The retention of the original consumer as an obligor in some capacity does \nnot prevent the change from being an assumption, provided the new consumer becomes a primary obligor. But the \nmere addition of a guarantor to an obligation for which the original consumer remains primarily liable does not give \nrise to an assumption. However, if neither party is designated as the primary obligor but the creditor accepts \npayment from the subsequent consumer, an assumption exists for purposes of \u00a7 226.20(b).\n\n[5.] 4. Status of parties. Section 226.20(b) applies only if the previous debtor was a consumer and the obligation is \nassumed by another consumer. It does not apply, for example, when an individual takes over the obligation of a \ncorporation.\n\n[6.] 5. Disclosures. For transactions that are assumptions within this provision, the creditor must make disclosures \nbased on the \"remaining obligation.\" For example:\n\ni. The amount financed is the remaining principal balance plus any arrearages or other accrued charges from the \noriginal transaction.\n\nii. If the finance charge is computed from time to time by application of a percentage rate to an unpaid balance, in \ndetermining the amount of the finance charge and the annual percentage rate to be disclosed, the creditor should \ndisregard any prepaid finance charges paid by the original obligor, but must include in the finance charge any \nprepaid finance charge imposed in connection with the assumption.\n\niii. If the creditor requires the assuming consumer to pay any charges as a condition of the assumption, those sums \nare prepaid finance charges as to that consumer, unless exempt from the finance charge under \u00a7 226.4. If a \ntransaction involves add-on or discount finance charges, the creditor may make abbreviated disclosures, as \noutlined in section 226.20(b)(1) through (5). [Creditors providing disclosures pursuant to this section for \nassumptions of variable-rate transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term longer than one \nyear need not provide new disclosures under sections 226.18(f)(2)(ii) or. In such transactions, a creditor may \ndisclose the variable-rate feature solely in accordance with section 226.18(f)(1).\n\n\n\n7. Abbreviated disclosures. The abbreviated disclosures permitted for assumptions of transactions involving add-on \nor discount finance charges must be made clearly and conspicuously in writing in a form that the consumer may \nkeep. However, the creditor need not comply with the segregation requirement of \u00a7 226.17(a)(1). The terms annual \npercentage rate and total of payments, when disclosed according to \u00a7 226.20(b)(4) and (5), are not subject to the \ndescription requirements of \u00a7 226.18 (e) and (h). The term annual percentage rate disclosed under \u00a7 226.20(b)(4) \nneed not be more conspicuous than other disclosures.\n\nParagraph 20(c) Variable-rate adjustments] 20(c) Rate adjustments.\n\n1. [Timing of adjustment notices] General. This section requires a creditor (or a subsequent holder) to provide \ncertain disclosures in cases where an adjustment to the interest rate is made in an [variable-rate] adjustable-rate \nmortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 226.19(b). [There are two timing rules, depending on whether payment changes \naccompany interest rate changes. A creditor is required to provide at least one notice each year during which \ninterest-rate adjustments have occurred without accompanying payment adjustments. For payment adjustments, a \ncreditor must deliver or place in the mail notices to borrowers at least 25, but not more than 120, calendar days \nbefore a payment at a new level is due. The timing rules also apply to the notice required to be given in connection \nwith the adjustment to the rate and payment that follows conversion of a transaction subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) to a \nfixed-rate transaction.] This section also requires that notice be given where a transaction subject to \u00a7 226.19(b) is \nconverted to a fixed-rate transaction. (In cases where an open-end account is converted to a closed-end transaction \nsubject to \u00a7 226.19(b), the requirements of this section do not apply until adjustments are made following \nconversion.)\n\n2. [Exceptions.] Not applicable. Section 226.20(c) does not apply to [\"shared-equity,\" \"shared-appreciation,\" or] \n\"price level adjusted\" or similar mortgages, because such mortgages are not adjustable-rate mortgages subject to \nthe disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.19(b). See comment 19(b)-3.\n\n3. Basis of disclosures. The disclosures required under this section shall reflect the terms of the parties' legal \nobligation, as required under \u00a7 226.17(c)(1).\n\n20(c)(1) Timing of disclosures.\n\n1. When required. Payment changes due to changes in property tax obligations or mortgage-related insurance \npremiums do not trigger the requirement to make disclosures under \u00a7 226.20(c)(1)(i).\n\n[Paragraph 20(c)(1)] Paragraph 20(c)(2)(ii).\n\n1. Current and [prior] new interest rates. The requirements under this paragraph are satisfied by disclosing the \ninterest rate used to compute the new adjusted payment amount [(\"current rate\")] (\"new rate\") and the adjusted \ninterest rate that was disclosed in the last adjustment notice[, as well as all other interest rates applied to the \ntransaction in the period since the last notice (\"prior rates\")] (\"current rate\"). (If there has been no prior adjustment \nnotice, the [prior rates are] current rate is the interest rate applicable to the transaction at consummation.) [, as well \nas all other interest rates applied to the transaction in the period since consummation.) If no payment adjustment \nhas been made in a year, the current rate is the new adjusted interest rate for the transaction, and the prior rates \nare the adjusted interest rate applicable to the loan at the time of the last adjustment notice, and all other rates \napplied to the transaction in the period between the current and last adjustment notices. In disclosing all other rates \napplied to the transaction during the period between notices, a creditor may disclose a range of the highest and \nlowest rates applied during that period.]\n\n[Paragraph 20(c)(2).\n\n1. Current and prior index values. This section requires disclosure of the index or formula values used to compute \nthe current and prior interest rates disclosed in \u00a7 226.20(c)(1). The creditor need not disclose the margin used in \ncomputing the rates. If the prior interest rate was not based on an index or formula value, the creditor also need not \ndisclose the value of the index that would otherwise have been used to compute the prior interest rate.]\n\n\n\n[Paragraph 20(c)(3)] Paragraph 20(c)(2)(iv).\n\n1. Unapplied index increases. The requirement that the consumer receive information about the extent to which the \ncreditor has foregone any increase in the interest rate and the earliest date a creditor may apply foregone interest to \nfuture adjustments, subject to rate caps, is applicable only to those transactions permitting interest rate carryover. \nThe amount of increase that is foregone at an adjustment is the amount that, subject to rate caps, can be applied to \nfuture adjustments independently to increase, or offset decreases in, the rate that is determined according to the \nindex or formula.\n\n[Paragraph 20(c)(4).\n\n1. Contractual effects of the adjustment. The contractual effects of an interest rate adjustment must be disclosed \nincluding the payment due after the adjustment is made whether or not the payment has been adjusted. A \ncontractual effect of a rate adjustment would include, for example, disclosure of any change in the term or maturity \nof the loan if the change resulted from the rate adjustment. In transactions where paying the periodic payments will \nnot fully amortize the outstanding balance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equal the \nperiodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the amount of the adjusted payment must be disclosed if such \npayment has changed as a result of the rate adjustment. A statement of the loan balance also is required. The \nbalance required to be disclosed is the balance on which the new adjusted payment is based. If no payment \nadjustment is disclosed in the notice, the balance disclosed should be the loan balance on which the payment \ndisclosed under \u00a7 226.20(c)(5) is based, if applicable, or the balance at the time the disclosure is prepared.]\n\nParagraph 20(c)(5)] Paragraph 20(c)(2)(vi).\n\n1. Fully-amortizing payment. This paragraph requires a disclosure of the fully amortizing payment only when \nnegative amortization occurs as a result of the adjustment. A disclosure is not required simply because a loan calls \nfor non-amortizing or partially amortizing payments. For example, in a transaction with a five-year term and \npayments based on a longer amortization schedule, and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment \nplus the remaining unpaid balance, the creditor would not have to disclose the payment necessary to fully amortize \nthe loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is required, however, if the new payment disclosed \nunder [\u00a7 226.20(c)(4)]\n\n\u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(ii)(C) is not sufficient to prevent negative amortization in the loan. The adjustment notice must state \nthe payment required to prevent negative amortization. (This paragraph does not apply if the payment disclosed in \n[\u00a7 226.20(c)(4)]\n\n\u00a7 226.20(c)(2)(ii)(C) is sufficient to prevent negative amortization in the loan but the final payment will be a different \namount due to rounding.)\n\n2. Effect on loan term. The creditor must disclose any change in the term or maturity of the loan if the change \nresulted from the rate adjustment. The creditor need not make that disclosure if the loan term or maturity has not \nchanged.\n\n20(c)(2)(vii) Loan balance in payment change notice.\n\n1. Basis of disclosure. A statement of the loan balance must be disclosed. The balance required to be disclosed is \nthe balance on which the new adjusted payment is based.\n\nParagraph 20(c)(3)(iii).\n\n1. Unapplied index increases. Creditors may rely on comment 20(c)(2)(iv)--1 in determining which transactions the \nrequirement to disclose foregone interest increases applies to and how to disclose such increases. Although \ncreditors must disclose the earliest date the creditor may apply foregone interest to future adjustments under \u00a7 \n226.20(c)(2)(iv), creditors need not disclose this information in the disclosures required by \u00a7 226.20(c)(3)(iv), which \nare made when interest rate changes do not cause payment changes during a year.\n\n\n\nParagraph 20(c)(3)(v).\n\n1. Basis of disclosure. A statement of the loan balance must be disclosed. The balance required to be disclosed is \nthe balance on the last day of the period for which the creditor discloses the highest and lowest interest rates.\n\n20(d) Periodic statement.\n\n20(d)(1) Timing and content of disclosures.\n\n1. Timing and content. Creditors must provide payment summary tables under \u00a7 226.20(d) starting with the first \nperiod after consummation, even if the initial payments required do not negatively amortize the loan. However, \npayment summary tables need contain only those disclosures that apply to payment options actually available to a \nconsumer. For example, if a consumer has been making the minimum required payments but must begin making \nfully amortizing payments because the creditor has recast the loan, the payment summary table need not disclose \npayments other than the fully amortizing payment.\n\n2. Assumptions. Creditors may base all disclosures on the assumption that payments will be made on time and in \nthe amounts required by the terms of the legal obligation, disregarding any possible inaccuracies resulting from \nconsumers' payment patterns. See comment 17(c)(1)-1 and comment 17(c)(2)(i)--3. Creditors may not assume that \nconsumers make payments greater than the minimum payment required by the legal obligation. That is, creditors \nmay not base disclosures for loans with a payment option that results in negative amortization on the fully \namortizing, interest-only, or other payment unless that payment is the amount the consumer is required to pay \nunder the terms of the legal obligation.\n\n20(d)(1)(i) Payment.\n\n1. Payment type. Creditors may rely on comment 38(c)(5)-1 to determine whether a payment is a regular periodic \npayment or a balloon payment.\n\n20(d)(1)(ii) Effects.\n\n1. Legal obligation. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.20(d) must reflect the terms of the legal obligation. For \nexample, the disclosures may not state that making fully amortizing payments on an interest-only loan will reduce a \nconsumer's loan balance if the creditor will not apply payments that exceed the interest-only payment to principal.\n\n20(e) Creditor-placed property insurance.\n\n1. Notice period timing and charges. The notice period begins on the day that the creditor mails or delivers the \nnotice to the consumer and expires 45 days later. The creditor may begin to charge the consumer for creditor-\nplaced property insurance on the 46th calendar day after sending the notice if the creditor has fulfilled the \nrequirements of section 226.20(e)(1)-(3). For example, a creditor that mails the required notice on January 2, 2011, \nmay begin to charge the consumer for the cost of the creditor-placed property insurance on February 18, 2011. \nAfter expiration of the 45-day notice period, a creditor may retroactively charge a consumer for the cost of any \nrequired property insurance obtained during the 45-day notice period if such charge is not prohibited by applicable \nState or other law.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.24--Advertising.\n\n* * * *\n\n24(c) Advertisement of rate of finance charge.\n* * * *\n\n\n\n4.

For each transaction secured by real property or a dwelling subject to \nthe loan originator compensation provisions in \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), a creditor should maintain records of the \ncompensation it provided to the loan originator for the transaction as well as the compensation agreement in effect \non the date the interest rate was set for the transaction. See \u00a7 226.35(a) and comment 35(a)(2)-3 for additional \nguidance on when a transaction's rate is set. Where a loan originator is a mortgage broker, a copy of the HUD--1 \nsettlement statement required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) would be presumed to be a \nrecord of the amount actually paid to the loan originator in connection with the transaction.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.30--Limitation on Rates.\n\n1. Scope of coverage. i. The requirement of this section applies to consumer credit obligations secured by a \ndwelling (as dwelling is defined in \u00a7 226.2(a)(19)) in which the annual percentage rate may increase after \nconsummation (or during the term of the plan, in the case of open-end credit) as a result of an increase in the \ninterest rate component of the finance charge--whether those increases are tied to an index or formula or are within \na creditor's discretion. The section applies to credit sales as well as loans. Examples of credit obligations subject to \nthis section include:\n\n[.] A. Dwelling-secured credit obligations that require variable-rate disclosures under the regulation because the \ninterest rate may increase during the term of the obligation.\n\n[.] B. Dwelling-secured open-end credit plans entered into before November 7, 1989 (the effective date of the home \nequity rules) that are not considered variable-rate obligations for purposes of disclosure under the regulation but \nwhere the creditor reserves the contractual right to increase the interest rate--periodic rate and corresponding \nannual percentage rate--during the term of the plan.\n\nii. In contrast, credit obligations in which there is no contractual right to increase the interest rate during the term of \nthe obligation are not subject to this section. Examples include:\n\n[.] A. \"Shared-equity\" or \"shared-appreciation\" mortgage loans that have a fixed rate of interest and a shared-\nappreciation feature based on the consumer's equity in the mortgaged property. (The appreciation share is payable \nin a lump sum at a specified time.)\n\n\n\n[.] B. Dwelling-secured fixed-rate closed-end balloon-payment mortgage loans and dwelling-secured fixed-rate \nopen-end plans with a stated term that the creditor may renew at maturity. (Contrast with the renewable balloon-\npayment mortgage instrument described in comment [17(c)(1)-11.)] 17(c)(1)(iii)--4.\n\n[.] C. Dwelling-secured fixed rate closed-end multiple advance transactions in which each advance is disclosed as a \nseparate transaction.\n\n[.] D. \"Price level adjusted mortgages\" or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for \nperiodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation.\n\niii. The requirement of this section does not apply to credit obligations entered into prior to December 9, 1987. \nConsequently, new advances under open-end credit plans existing prior to December 9, 1987, are not subject to \nthis section.\n\n* * * *\n\nSubpart E--Special Rules for Certain Home Mortgage Transactions\n\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.32--Requirements for Certain Closed-End Home Mortgages.\n\n* * * *\n\n[32(b) Definitions.\n\nParagraph 32(b)(1)(i).\n\n1. General. Section 226.32(b)(1)(i) includes in the total \"points and fees\" items defined as finance charges under \u00a7\u00a7 \n226.4(a) and 226.4(b). Items excluded from the finance charge under other provisions of \u00a7 226.4 are not included in \nthe total \"points and fees\" under paragraph 32(b)(1)(i), but may be included in \"points and fees\" under paragraphs \n32(b)(1)(ii) and 32(b)(1)(iii). Interest, including per-diem interest, is excluded from \"points and fees\" under \u00a7 \n226.32(b)(1).\n\nParagraph 32(b)(1)(ii).\n\n1. Mortgage broker fees. In determining \"points and fees\" for purposes of this section, compensation paid by a \nconsumer to a mortgage broker (directly or through the creditor for delivery to the broker) is included in the \ncalculation whether or not the amount is disclosed as a finance charge. Mortgage broker fees that are not paid by \nthe consumer are not included. Mortgage broker fees already included in the calculation as finance charges under \u00a7 \n226.32(b)(1)(i) need not be counted again under \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(ii).\n\n2. Example. Section 226.32(b)(1)(iii) defines \"points and fees\" to include all items listed in \u00a7 226.4(c)(7), other than \namounts held for the future payment of taxes. An item listed in \u00a7 226.4(c)(7) may be excluded from the \"points and \nfees\" calculation, however, if the charge is reasonable, the creditor receives no direct or indirect compensation from \nthe charge, and the charge is not paid to an affiliate of the creditor. For example, a reasonable fee paid by the \nconsumer to an independent, third-party appraiser may be excluded from the \"points and fees\" calculation \n(assuming no compensation is paid to the creditor). A fee paid by the consumer for an appraisal performed by the \ncreditor must be included in the calculation, even though the fee may be excluded from the finance charge if it is \nbona fide and reasonable in amount.\n\nParagraph 32(b)(1)(iv).\n\n\n\n1. Premium amount. In determining \"points and fees\" for purposes of this section, premiums paid at or before \nclosing for credit insurance are included whether they are paid in cash or financed, and whether the amount \nrepresents the entire premium for the coverage or an initial payment.]\n\n32(c) Disclosures.\n\n[1.

See http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda. The Board calculates an annual percentage \nrate, consistent with Regulation Z (see \u00a7 226.22 and appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing terms \nare available from a survey. The Board estimates annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for which \ndirect survey data are not available based on the loan pricing terms available in the survey and other information. \nThe Board publishes on the FFIEC's Web site [Internet] the methodology it uses to arrive at these estimates.\n\n5. Additional guidance on determination of average prime offer rates. The average prime offer rate has the same \nmeaning in this section as under Regulation C, 12 CFR part 203. See 12 CFR 203.4(a)(12)(ii). Guidance on the \naverage prime offer rate under \u00a7 226.35(a)(2), such as when a transaction's rate is set and determination of the \ncomparable transaction, is provided in the staff commentary under Regulation C, the Board's A Guide to HMDA \nReporting: Getting it Right, and the relevant \"Frequently Asked Questions\" on HMDA compliance posted on the \nFFIEC's Web site at http://ffiec.gov/ hmda.\n* * * *\n\n\u00a7 226.36--Prohibited Acts or Practices in Connection with Credit Secured by Real Property or a Dwelling [a \nConsumer's Principal Dwelling].\n* * * *\n\n36(a) Loan originator and mortgage broker defined.\n\n1. Meaning of loan originator [mortgage broker]. Section 226.36(a) provides that a loan originator [mortgage broker] \nis any person who for compensation or other monetary gain arranges, negotiates, or otherwise obtains an extension \nof consumer credit for another person. The term \"loan originator\" includes employees of the creditor [but is not an \nemployee of a creditor]. In addition, this definition expressly includes any creditor [person] that satisfies this \n\n\n\ndefinition but makes use of \"table funding.\" Table funding occurs when a transaction is consummated with the debt \nobligation initially payable by its terms to one person, but another person provides the funds for the transaction at \nconsummation and receives an immediate assignment of the note, loan contract, or other evidence of the debt \nobligation. Although \u00a7 226.2(a)(17)(i)(B) provides that a person to whom a debt obligation is initially payable on its \nface generally is a creditor, \u00a7 226.36(a) provides that, solely for the purposes of \u00a7 226.36, such a person is also \nconsidered a loan originator [considered a mortgage broker]. The creditor is not considered a loan originator unless \ntable funding occurs. In addition, although consumers themselves often arrange, negotiate, or otherwise obtain \nextensions of consumer credit on their own behalf, they do not do so for compensation or other monetary gain or for \nanother person and, therefore, are not loan originators [mortgage brokers] under this section.\n\n2. Mortgage broker. For purposes of \u00a7 226.36, with respect to a particular transaction, the term \"mortgage broker\" \nrefers to a loan originator who is not an employee of the creditor. Accordingly, the term \"mortgage broker\" includes \ncompanies that engage in the activities described in \u00a7 226.36(a) and also includes employees of such companies \nthat engage in these activities. Section 226.36(d) prohibits certain payments to a loan originator. These prohibitions \napply to payments made to all loan originators, including payments made to mortgage brokers, and payments made \nby a company acting as a mortgage broker to its employees who are loan originators.\n\n36(b) Misrepresentation of value of consumer's [principal] dwelling.\n\n* * * *\n\n36(d) Prohibited payments to loan originators.\n\n1. Persons covered. Section 226.36(d) prohibits any person (including the creditor) from paying compensation to a \nloan originator in connection with a covered credit transaction, if the amount of the payment is based on any of the \ntransaction's terms or conditions. For example, a person that purchases a loan from the creditor may not \ncompensate the loan originator in a manner that violates this section.\n\n2. Mortgage brokers. The payments made by a company acting as a mortgage broker to its employees who are \nloan originators are subject to the section's prohibitions. For example, a mortgage broker may not pay its employee \nmore for a transaction with a 7 percent interest rate than for a transaction with a 6 percent interest rate.\n\n36(d)(1) Payments based on transaction terms and conditions.\n\n1. Compensation. For purposes of \u00a7 226.36(d)(1) and (e) the term \"compensation\" is not limited to commissions; it \nincludes salaries and any financial or similar incentive provided to a loan originator that is based on any of the terms \nand conditions of the loan originator's transactions. (See comment 36(d)(1)-2 for examples of types of \ncompensation that are not covered by \u00a7 226.36(d) and (e)). For example, the term \"compensation\" includes:\n\ni. An annual or other periodic bonus; or\n\nii. Awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes.\n\n2. Examples of compensation that is based on transaction terms or conditions. Section 226.36(d)(1) prohibits loan \noriginator compensation that is based on a transaction's terms or conditions. For example, the rule prohibits \ncompensation based on the transaction's interest rate, annual percentage rate, loan-to-value ratio, or the existence \nof a prepayment penalty. A consumer's credit score or similar representation of credit risk is not one of the \ntransaction's terms and conditions, but a creditor does not necessarily avoid having based a loan originator's \ncompensation on the interest rate or the annual percentage rate solely because the originator's compensation \nhappens to vary with the consumer's credit score as well.\n\n3. Examples of compensation not based on transaction terms or conditions. Compensation would not be based on \nthe transaction's terms or conditions if it were based on, for example:\n\ni. The loan originator's overall loan volume delivered to the creditor.\n\n\n\nii. The long-term performance of the originator's loans.\n\niii. A fixed hourly rate of pay to compensate the originator for the actual number of hours worked.\n\niv. Whether the consumer is an existing customer of the creditor or a new customer.\n\n4. Geographic differences. Section 226.36(d)(1) does not prohibit the payment of compensation to a loan originator \nthat differs by geographical area, provided such compensation is not based on the transaction's terms or conditions. \nAny such arrangement must comply with other applicable laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \n1691-1691f, and Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619.\n\n5. Creditor's flexibility in setting loan terms. Section 226.36(d)(1) does not limit the creditor's ability to offer a higher \ninterest rate in a transaction as a means for the consumer to finance the payment of the loan originator's \ncompensation or other costs that the consumer would otherwise be required to pay directly (either in cash or out of \nthe loan proceeds). Thus, a creditor may charge a higher interest rate to a consumer who will pay fewer of the costs \nof the transaction directly, or the creditor may offer the consumer a lower rate if the consumer pays more of the \ncosts directly. For example, if the consumer pays half of the transaction costs directly, the creditor may charge an \ninterest rate of 6% but, if the consumer pays none of the transaction costs directly, may charge an interest rate of \n6.5%. Section 226.36(d)(1) also does not limit a creditor from offering or providing different loan terms to the \nconsumer based on the creditor's assessment of the credit risk involved. A creditor also may set loan terms by \noffering varying interest rates to different consumers that include a constant interest rate premium to recoup the \nloan originator's compensation through increased interest paid by the consumer (such as by adding a constant 1/4 \nof one percent to the interest rate on each loan).\n\n6. Effect of modification of loan terms. Under \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), a loan originator's compensation may not vary based \non any of a credit transaction's terms and conditions. Thus, a creditor and originator could not agree to set the \noriginator's compensation at a higher level and then subsequently lower it in selective cases (such as where the \nconsumer is able to obtain a lower rate from another creditor). When the creditor offers to extend a loan with \nspecified terms and conditions (such as the rate and points) the amount of the originator's compensation for that \ntransaction is not subject to change (increase or decrease) based on whether different loan terms are negotiated. \nFor example, if the creditor agrees to lower the rate that was initially offered, the new offer may not be accompanied \nby a reduction in the loan originator's compensation.\n\n7. Periodic changes in loan originator compensation and transactions' terms and conditions. This section does not \nlimit a creditor from periodically revising the compensation it agrees to pay a loan originator. However, the revised \ncompensation arrangement must result in payments to the loan originator that do not vary based on the terms or \nconditions of a credit transaction. A creditor might periodically review factors such as loan performance, transaction \nvolume, as well as current market conditions for originator compensation, and prospectively revise the \ncompensation it agrees to pay to a loan originator. For example, assume that during the first 6 months of the year, a \ncreditor pays $ 3,000 to a particular loan originator for each loan delivered, regardless of the loan terms. After \nconsidering the volume of business produced by that originator, the creditor could decide that as of July 1, it will pay \n$ 3,250 for each loan delivered by that particular originator, regardless of the loan terms. No violation occurs even if \nthe loans made by the creditor after July 1 generally carry a higher interest rate than loans made before that date, \nto reflect the higher compensation.\n\n8. Compensation received directly from a consumer. The prohibition in \u00a7 226.36(d)(1) does not apply to \ntransactions in which the loan originator receives compensation directly from the consumer, in which case no other \nperson may provide any compensation to the loan originator, directly or indirectly, in connection with that particular \ntransaction pursuant to \u00a7 226.36(d)(2).\n\n9. Record retention. See comment 25(a)--5 for guidance on complying with the record retention requirements of \u00a7 \n226.25(a) as they apply to this section.\n\nALTERNATIVE COMMENT 36(d)(1)-10, TO ACCOMPANY ALTERNATIVE 2--PARAGRAPH (d):\n\n\n\n10. Principal loan amount. A loan originator's compensation may be based on the loan amount. Thus, an \narrangement that pays a loan originator a fixed percentage of the loan amount does not violate this section even \nthough the dollar amount received by the originator will vary from transaction to transaction and will be greater as \nthe loan amount increases. Section 226.36(d)(1) does not prohibit an arrangement under which a loan originator is \npaid a fixed percentage of the loan amount, subject to specified minimum or maximum dollar amount. For example, \na loan originator's compensation may be set at one percent of the principal loan amount but not less than $ 1,000 or \ngreater than $ 5,000.\n\n36(d)(2) Payments by persons other than consumer.\n\n1. Compensation in connection with a particular transaction. Under \u00a7 226.36(d)(2), if a loan originator receives \ncompensation directly from a consumer in a transaction, no other person may provide any compensation to the loan \noriginator, directly or indirectly, in connection with that particular credit transaction. The restrictions imposed under \u00a7 \n226.36(d)(2) relate only to payments, such as commissions, that are specific to, and paid solely in connection with, \nthe transaction in which the consumer has paid compensation directly to the loan originator. Thus, compensation \npaid by a mortgage broker company to an employee in the form of a salary or hourly wage, which is not tied \nspecifically to a single transaction, does not violate \u00a7 226.36(d)(2) even if the consumer directly pays a broker a fee \nin connection with a specific transaction.\n\n2. Compensation received directly from a consumer. Under Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate \nSettlement Procedures Act (RESPA), a yield spread premium paid by a creditor to the loan originator may be \ncharacterized on the RESPA disclosures as a \"credit\" that will be applied to reduce the consumer's settlement \ncharges, including origination fees. A yield spread premium disclosed in this manner is not considered to be \nreceived by the loan originator directly from the consumer for purposes of \u00a7 226.36(d)(2).\n\n36(d)(3) Affiliates.\n\n1. For purposes of \u00a7 226.36(d), affiliated entities are treated as a single \"person.\" For example, assume a parent \ncompany has two mortgage lending subsidiaries. Under \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), subsidiary \"A\" could not pay a loan \noriginator greater compensation for a loan with an interest rate of 8 percent than it would pay for a loan with an \ninterest rate of 7 percent. If the loan originator may deliver loans to both subsidiaries, they must compensate the \nloan originator in the same manner. Accordingly, if the loan originator delivers the loan to subsidiary \"B\" and the \ninterest rate is 8 percent, the originator must receive the same compensation that would have been paid by \nsubsidiary A for a loan with a rate of either 7 or 8 percent. COMMENTS 36(e)-1, 36(e)(1)-1 THROUGH 36(e)(1)-3, \n36(e)(2)-1 AND 36(e)(2)-2, and 36(e)(3)-1 THROUGH 36(e)(3)-4, TO ACCOMPANY OPTIONAL PROPOSAL--\nPARAGRAPH (e).\n\n36(e) Prohibition on steering.\n\n1. Compensation. See comment 36(d)(1)-1 for guidance on compensation that is subject to \u00a7 226.36(e).\n\nParagraph 36(e)(1).\n\n1. Steering. For purposes of \u00a7 226.36(e), directing or \"steering\" a consumer to a particular credit transaction means \nadvising, counseling, or otherwise influencing a consumer to accept that transaction. For such actions to constitute \nsteering, the consumer must actually consummate the transaction in question. Thus \u00a7 226.36(e)(1) does not \naddress the actions of a loan originator if the consumer does not actually obtain a loan through that originator.\n\n2. Prohibited conduct. Under \u00a7 226.36(e)(1), a loan originator may not direct or steer a consumer to a loan to \nincrease the amount of compensation that the originator will receive for the transaction unless the loan is in the \nconsumer's interest.\n\ni. In determining whether a consummated transaction is in the consumer's interest, that transaction must be \ncompared to other possible loan offers available through the originator, and for which the consumer was likely to \n\n\n\nqualify, at the time the consummated transaction was offered to the consumer. Possible loan offers are available \nthrough the loan originator if they could be obtained from a creditor with which the loan originator regularly does \nbusiness. Section 226.36(e)(1) does not require a loan originator to establish a business relationship with any \ncreditor with which the loan originator does not already do business. To be considered a \"possible loan offer,\" an \noffer need not be extended by the creditor; it need only be an offer that the creditor likely would extend upon \nreceiving an application from a qualified applicant, based on the creditor's current rate sheets or other, similar \nmeans of communicating its current credit terms to the loan originator. An originator need not inform the consumer \nabout a possible loan offer if the originator is able to make a good faith determination that the consumer is not likely \nto qualify for the loan.\n\nii. Section 226.36(e)(1) does not require a loan originator to direct a consumer to the transaction that will result in a \ncreditor paying the least amount of compensation to the originator. However, if the loan originator reviews possible \nloan offers available from a significant number of the creditors with which the originator regularly does business, \nand the originator directs the consumer to the transaction that will result in the least amount of creditor-paid \ncompensation for the loan originator, the requirements of \u00a7 226.36(e)(1) are deemed to be satisfied. A loan \noriginator who is an employee of the creditor may not obtain compensation that is based on the transaction's terms \nor conditions pursuant to \u00a7 226.36(d)(1), and compliance with that provision by such a loan originator also satisfies \nthe requirements of \u00a7 226.36(e)(1).\n\niii. See the commentary under \u00a7 226.36(e)(3) for additional guidance on what constitutes a \"significant number of \ncreditors with which a loan originator regularly does business\" and guidance on the determination about \ntransactions for which \"the consumer likely qualifies.\"\n\n3. Examples. Assume the originator determines that a consumer likely qualifies for a loan from Creditor A that has a \nfixed interest rate of 7.00 percent, but the loan originator directs the consumer to a loan from Creditor B having a \nrate of 7.50 percent. If the loan originator receives more in compensation from Creditor B than the amount that \nwould have been paid by Creditor A, the prohibition in \u00a7 226.36(e) is violated unless the higher-rate loan is in the \nconsumer's interest. For example, a higher rate loan might be in the consumer's interest if the lower rate loan has a \nprepayment penalty, or if the lower rate loan requires the consumer to pay more in up-front charges that the \nconsumer is unable or unwilling to pay or finance as part of the loan amount.\n\n36(e)(2) Permissible transactions.\n\n1. Safe harbors. A loan originator that complies with \u00a7 226.36(e)(2) is deemed to comply with \u00a7 226.36(e)(1). A loan \noriginator that does not comply with \u00a7 226.36(e)(2) is not subject to any presumption regarding the originator's \ncompliance or noncompliance with \u00a7 226.36(e)(1).\n\n2. Minimum number of loan options. To obtain the safe harbor, \u00a7 226.36(e)(2) requires that the loan originator \npresent at least three loan options for each type of transaction in which the consumer expressed an interest. As \nrequired by \u00a7 226.36(e)(3)(ii), the loan originator must have a good faith belief that the options presented are loans \nfor which the consumer likely qualifies. If the loan originator is not able to form such a good faith belief for at least \nthree options for a given type of transaction, the loan originator may satisfy the minimum number of loan options set \nforth in \u00a7 226.36(e)(2) by presenting all loan options for which the consumer likely qualifies and that meet the other \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.36(e)(3).\n\n36(e)(3) Loan options presented.\n\n1. Significant number of creditors. A significant number of the creditors with which a loan originator regularly does \nbusiness is three or more of those creditors. If the loan originator regularly does business with fewer than three \ncreditors, the originator is deemed to comply by obtaining loan options from all the creditors with which it regularly \ndoes business. Under \u00a7 226.36(e)(3)(i), the loan originator must obtain loan options from a significant number of \ncreditors with which the loan originator regularly does business, but the loan originator need not present loan \noptions from all such creditors to the consumer to satisfy \u00a7 226.36(e)(2). For example, if three loan options available \n\n\n\nfrom one of the creditors with which the loan originator regularly does business satisfy \u00a7 226.36(e)(3)(i), presenting \nthose and no options from any other creditor satisfies \u00a7 226.36(e)(2).\n\n2. Creditors with which loan originator regularly does business. To qualify for the safe harbor in \u00a7 226.36(e)(2), the \nloan originator must obtain and review loan options from a significant number of the creditors with which the loan \noriginator regularly does business. For this purpose, a loan originator regularly does business with a creditor if:\n\ni. There is a written agreement between the originator and the creditor governing the originator's submission of \nmortgage loan applications to the creditor;\n\nii. The creditor has extended credit secured by real property or a dwelling to one or more consumers during the \ncurrent or previous calendar month based on an application submitted by the loan originator; or\n\niii. The creditor has extended credit secured by real property or a dwelling 25 or more times during the previous \ntwelve calendar months based on applications submitted by the loan originator. For this purpose the previous \ntwelve calendar months begins with the calendar month that precedes the month in which the loan originator \naccepted the consumer's application.\n\n3. Lowest interest rate. To qualify under the safe harbor in \u00a7 226.36(e)(2), for each type of transaction in which the \nconsumer has expressed an interest, the loan originator must present the consumer with at least three loans that \ninclude the loan with the lowest interest rate, the loan with the second lowest rate, and the loan with the lowest total \ndollar amount for discount points and origination points. To determine the loan with the lowest interest rate, for any \nloan that has an initial rate that is fixed for at least five years, the loan originator shall use the initial rate that would \nbe in effect at consummation. For a loan with an initial rate that is not fixed for at least five years:\n\ni. If the interest rate varies based on changes to an index, the originator shall use the fully-indexed rate that would \nbe in effect at consummation without regard to any initial discount.\n\nii. For a step-rate loan the originator shall use the highest rate that would apply during the first five years.\n\n4. Transactions for which the consumer likely qualifies. To qualify under the safe harbor in \u00a7 226.36(e)(2), the loan \noriginator must have a good faith belief that the loan options presented to the consumer pursuant to \u00a7 226.36(e)(3) \nare transactions for which the consumer likely qualifies. The loan originator's belief that the consumer likely qualifies \nshould be based on all information reasonably available to the loan originator at the time the loan options are being \npresented. The loan originator may rely on information provided by the consumer, even if it subsequently is \ndetermined to be inaccurate. For purposes of \u00a7 226.36(e)(3), a loan originator is not expected to know all aspects of \neach creditor's underwriting criteria. But pricing or other information that is routinely communicated by creditors to \nloan originators is considered to be reasonably available to the loan originator, for example, rate sheets showing \ncreditors' current pricing and the required minimum credit score or other eligibility criteria.\n\nSection 226.37--Special Disclosure Requirements for Closed-End Mortgages 37(a) Form of disclosures.\n\n1. Controlling standard. Transactions subject to this part are also subject to the clear and conspicuous standard \nunder \u00a7 226.17(a)(1). In some instances, \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) provides creditors more flexibility in meeting the clear and \nconspicuous standard. For example, disclosures for transactions subject only to \u00a7 226.17(a)(1) may be grouped \ntogether and segregated in a variety of ways and need not be given in a particular type size. In contrast, disclosures \nrequired for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, and therefore, also subject to \u00a7 226.37, must be \nsegregated from all other material and be provided in a minimum 10-point font. For such disclosures, creditors must \nuse the standards set forth under \u00a7 226.37(a) through (d).\n\n37(a)(1) General.\n\n1. Clear and conspicuous standard. The clear and conspicuous standard generally requires that disclosures be in a \nreasonably understandable form and readily noticeable to the consumer.\n\n\n\n2. Clear and conspicuous standard--readily noticeable. To meet the readily noticeable standard, disclosures \nrequired by \u00a7\u00a7 226.19, 226.20(c), 226.20(d), and 226.38 must be given in a minimum 10-point font.\n\n3. Location. The disclosures required under \u00a7\u00a7 226.19 or 226.38 must appear on a document separate from all \nother material. The disclosures required under \u00a7\u00a7 226.19, 226.20(c), 226.20(d) or 226.38 may be made on more \nthan one page, continued from one page to another, and made on the front or back side of a page, except as \notherwise specifically required.\n\n37(a)(2) Grouped and Segregated.\n\n1. Segregation of disclosures. The disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.19, 226.20(c), 226.20(d) or 226.38 must be \nsegregated from other information. The disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 may be grouped together, in accordance with \nthe requirements under \u00a7 226.38(a)--(j), and segregated from other required disclosures under \u00a7 226.38\n\ni. By outlining them in a box.\n\nii. By bold print dividing lines.\n\niii. By a different color background.\n\niv. By a different type style.\n\n2. Content of segregated disclosures. Section 226.37(a)(2)(i)--(ii) contains exceptions to the requirement that the \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.38 be grouped together and segregated from material that is not directly related to \nthose disclosures. Section 226.37(a)(2)(i) lists the items that may be added to the segregated disclosures, even \nthough not directly related to those disclosures. Section 226.37(a)(2)(ii) lists the items required under \u00a7 226.38 that \nmay be deleted from the segregated disclosures and appear elsewhere. Any of these additions or deletions may be \ncombined and appear either together with or separate from the segregated disclosures.\n\n3. Directly related. The segregated disclosures may, at the creditor's option, include any information that is directly \nrelated to those disclosures. The following is directly related information:\n\ni. The basis for any estimates used in making disclosures. For example, if the maturity date of a loan depends \nsolely on the occurrence of a future event, the creditor may indicate that the disclosures assume that event will \noccur at a certain time.\n\nii. An explanation of the use of pronouns or other references to the parties to the transaction. For example, the \ndisclosures may state, \"'You' refers to the customer and 'we' refers to the creditor.\"\n\niii. A brief caption identifying the disclosures. For example, the disclosures may bear a general title such as \"Federal \nTruth in Lending Disclosures\" or a descriptive title such as \"Real Estate Loan Disclosures.\"\n\n4. Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics. See comment 17(a)(1)-7.\n\n37(c) Terminology.\n\n1. Consistent Terminology. Language used in disclosures required by \u00a7\u00a7 226.19, 226.20(c), 226.20(d), and 226.38 \nmust be close enough in meaning to enable the consumer to relate the different disclosures; however, the language \nneed not be identical, unless the use of specific terminology is required.\n\n2. Combining terminology. Where the amounts of several numerical disclosures are the same, creditors may \ncombine the terms, so long as it is done in a clear and conspicuous manner and in accordance with the \nrequirements under \u00a7 226.38. For example, in a transaction in which the amount financed equals the total \npayments, the creditor may disclose a single dollar amount together with the descriptive statement required for total \npayments under \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) and an explanation that the figure represents both the total payments and the \namount financed, and is used to calculate the annual percentage rate. However, if the terms are required to be \n\n\n\ndisclosed separately, both disclosures must be completed even though the same amount is entered into each \nspace.\n\n3. When disclosures must be more conspicuous. The following rules apply to the requirement that the annual \npercentage rate for the loan transaction, when disclosed with the term annual percentage rate, be shown more \nconspicuously:\n\ni. the annual percentage rate, expressed as a percentage, must be more conspicuous only in relation to other \nrequired disclosures under \u00a7 226.38.\n\nii. the annual percentage rate, expressed as a percentage, need not be more conspicuous except as part of the \nannual percentage rate disclosure required under \u00a7\u00a7 226.37(c)(2) and 226.38(b)(1).\n\niii. the term \"annual percentage rate\" must not be more conspicuous than the annual percentage rate, expressed as \na percentage and disclosed as required under \u00a7\u00a7 226.37(c)(2) and 226.38(b)(1).\n\niv. the creditor's identity under \u00a7 226.38(g)(1) may, but need not, be more prominently displayed than the annual \npercentage rate.\n\n4. Making disclosures more conspicuous. The annual percentage rate for the loan transaction, expressed as a \npercentage, may be made more conspicuous in any way that highlights it in relation to the other required \ndisclosures. For example, it may be:\n\ni. Printed in bold print or different type face; or\n\nii. Underlined.\n\n37(d) Specific Formats.\n\n1. Prominent Location. Disclosures meet the prominent location standard if located on the first page and on the \nfront side of the disclosure statement.\n\n2. Close Proximity. If the required disclosures are located immediately next to or directly above or below each other, \nwithout any intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures are deemed to be in close proximity.\n\nSection 226.38--Content of Disclosures for Closed-End Mortgages\n\n1. As applicable. The disclosures required by this section should be provided only as applicable. Any provision not \nrelevant to a particular transaction should not be disclosed, except as otherwise required under \u00a7 226.38(d)(1).\n\n2. Format. See the commentary to \u00a7\u00a7 226.17(a)(1) and 226.37 for a discussion of the format to be used in making \nthese disclosures, as well as acceptable modifications.\n\n38(a) Loan summary.\n\n38(a)(3) Loan type and features.\n\n1. General. The disclosure of loan type and features should reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the \nparties.\n\n38(a)(3)(i) Loan type.\n\n1. General. Creditors must identify the loan type as required in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i). Only one loan type may be \ndisclosed. The categories used in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i) are different from the categories in \u00a7 226.18(f) and commentary \nto \u00a7 226.17(c)(1).\n\n\n\n38(a)(3)(i)(A) Adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\n1. General. A transaction is an adjustable-rate mortgage for the purposes of this section if the annual percentage \nrate may increase after consummation. However, a transaction in which the annual percentage rate may change \nafter consummation solely because of a shared-equity or shared-appreciation feature is not an adjustable-rate \nmortgage for the purposes of this section. See \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(vi). Also, a step-rate mortgage is not an adjustable-\nrate mortgage for purposes of this section unless the interest rate or the applicable period for each interest rate can \nchange other than as specified in the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. See \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(i)(B). A \nfixed interest rate loan with a renewable balloon payment is not an adjustable-rate mortgage for purposes of this \nsection. See comment 38(a)(3)(i)(C)--1(v).\n\n2. Examples. The following transactions, for which the interest rate is variable, are examples of adjustable-rate \nmortgages for purposes of this section.\n\ni. the seller or a 3rd party pays an amount either to the creditor or to the consumer to buy down the interest rate for \nall or a portion of the credit term as described in comment 17(c)(1)(i)--1, regardless of whether the disclosures take \nthe buydown into account.\n\nii. the consumer pays an amount to the creditor to buy down the interest rate for all or a portion of the credit term as \ndescribed in comment 17(c)(1)(i)--2.\n\niii. a third party (such as a seller) and a consumer both pay an amount to the creditor to buy down the interest rate \nfor all or a portion of the credit term as described in comment 17(c)(1)(i)--4.\n\niv. a rate reduction option permits the consumer to adjust the existing variable interest rate to a lower variable \ninterest rate under certain conditions, in accordance with the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.\n\nv. the renewable balloon-payment option permits the consumer to renew the loan as described in comment \n17(c)(1)(iii)--4(i).\n\nvi. the terms of the legal obligation provide that the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as \nan employee leaving the employ of the creditor, as described in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--4(ii).\n\nvii. the terms of the legal obligation provide for periodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance, such as \n\"price-level-adjusted mortgages\" or other indexed mortgages that have a variable rate of interest and provide for \nperiodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation, \nas described in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--4(iii).\n\nviii. if the interest rate or the applicable period for each interest rate can change other than as specified in the terms \nof the legal obligation between the parties, such as certain step-rate mortgages, as described in comment \n38(a)(3)(i)(B)--1.\n\nix. the terms of the legal obligation provide for scheduled adjustments in payment amounts during the loan term, \nsuch as certain graduated-payment adjustable-rate mortgages, as described in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--6.\n\nx. the terms of the legal obligation give the consumer an option to convert the variable interest rate into a fixed \ninterest rate at a designated time or upon satisfaction of certain conditions.\n\n38(a)(3)(i)(B) Step-rate mortgages.\n\n1. General. A step-rate mortgage is a transaction for which the annual percentage rate will change after \nconsummation, and all of the interest rates that will apply throughout the term of the loan, including the applicable \nperiod for each interest rate, are specified in the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. As discussed in \ncomment 38(a)(3)(i)(A)--1, if the interest rate or the applicable period for each interest rate can change other than \n\n\n\nas specified in the terms of the legal obligation between the parties, such mortgage is considered an adjustable-rate \nmortgage and not a step-rate mortgage for purposes of this section.\n\n2. Exclusion. Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation provide that the initial interest rate is fixed \nbut will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the creditor, as \ndescribed in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--4, are considered fixed-rate mortgages and not step-rate mortgages for \npurposes of this section. See comment 38(a)(3)(i)(C)--1(vi).\n\n38(a)(3)(i)(C) Fixed-rate mortgages.\n\n1. Examples. The following transactions, for which the interest rate is fixed, are examples of fixed-rate mortgages \nfor purposes of this section.\n\ni. the seller or a third party pays an amount either to the creditor or to the consumer to buy down the interest rate for \nall or a portion of the credit term as described in comment 17(c)(1)(i)--1, regardless of whether the disclosures take \nthe buydown into account.\n\nii. the consumer pays an amount to the creditor to buy down the interest rate for all or a portion of the credit term as \ndescribed in comment 17(c)(1)(i)--2.\n\niii. a third party (such as a seller) and a consumer both pay an amount to the creditor to buy down the interest rate \nfor all or a portion of the credit term as described in comment 17(c)(1)(i)--4.\n\niv. a rate reduction option permits the consumer to adjust the existing fixed interest rate to a lower fixed interest rate \nunder certain conditions, in accordance with the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.\n\nv. the renewable balloon-payment option permits the consumer to renew the loan as described in comment \n17(c)(1)(iii)--4(i).\n\nvi. the terms of the legal obligation provide that the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as \nan employee leaving the employ of the creditor, as described in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--4(ii).\n\nvii. the terms of the legal obligation provide for periodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance, such as \n\"price-level-adjusted mortgages\" or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for \nperiodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation, \nas described in comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--4(iii).\n\n38(a)(3)(ii) Loan features.\n\n1. General. Creditors must indicate whether a loan has the features specified in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(ii). Under \u00a7 \n226.38(a)(3)(ii), a creditor should disclose no more than two features for a single loan. A loan may have both a \n\"step-payment\" feature in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(ii)(A) and one of the features in \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(ii)(B)--(D).\n\n38(a)(3)(ii)(A) Step-payments.\n\n1. General. If, under the terms of the legal obligation, a periodic monthly payment may increase by a set amount for \na specified amount of time, the creditor must disclose that the loan has a \"step-payment\" feature. For instance, if \nthe consumer is offered a fixed-rate mortgage with 24 monthly payments at $ 1,000 that will later increase to $ \n1,200 and remain at that level for a specified period of time, and the loan amortizes fully over the loan term, the \ncreditor would disclose \"Fixed-rate mortgage, step-payments\" for the loan type in the loan summary. See comment \n17(c)(1)(iii)--5 clarifying that graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without an adjustable-rate \nmortgage feature are not considered adjustable-rate mortgage transactions. However, if the consumer is offered an \nadjustable-rate mortgage loan with scheduled variations in payment amounts during the loan term, the creditor \nwould disclose \"Adjustable-rate mortgage, step-payments.\" See comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--6 for a discussion of \n\n\n\ngraduated-payment adjustable-rate mortgages. Also see comment 38(a)(3)(ii)--2 regarding loans with multiple \nfeatures.\n\nParagraphs 38(a)(3)(ii)(B) and (C)\n\n1. \"Payment option\" and \"negative amortization\" features--loans with negative amortization.\n\ni. Negative amortization occurs when one or more regular periodic payments is not sufficient to cover interest \naccrued and the unpaid interest is added to the loan balance. For purposes of the loan feature disclosure in \u00a7 \n226.38(a)(3)(ii), features that result in negative amortization are divided into two types:\n\nA. \"Payment option\" features, in which the terms of the legal obligation permit the consumer to make payments that \nresult in negative amortization and other types of payments; and\n\nB. \"Negative amortization\" features, in which the terms of the legal obligation require the consumer to make \npayments that result in negative amortization--that is, the legal obligation does not permit the consumer to make \npayments that would cover all interest accrued or all interest accrued and principal.\n\nii. Under \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(ii)(B) and (C), a creditor should disclose the loan feature as either \"payment option\" or \n\"negative amortization\" but not both. Under \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(ii)(A), however, a loan may have both a \"step-payment\" \nfeature and either a \"payment option\" or a \"negative amortization\" feature.\n\n2. Consumer's choice. For a loan to have a \"payment option\" feature, all periodic payment choices must be \nspecified in the legal obligation and must include a choice to make payments that may result in negative \namortization. For example, if the consumer is offered a loan with minimum monthly payments that will not reduce \nthe loan balance to remain the same (i.e., interest-only payments), but the terms of the legal obligation do not \nprevent the consumer from making payments that will decrease the loan balance, such a loan would be disclosed \nas having an \"interest-only\" feature and not a \"payment option\" feature for purposes of this section.\n\nParagraph 38(a)(3)(ii)(D)\n\n1. Interest-only feature. The creditor must disclose an \"interest-only\" feature if the terms of the legal obligation \npermit or require the consumer to make one or more regular periodic payments of interest accrued and no principal, \nand the legal obligation does not require or permit any payments that would result in negative amortization. Thus, a \ncreditor should not disclose both an \"interest-only\" feature and a \"payment option\" feature or \"negative \namortization\" feature in a single transaction. Under \u00a7 226.38(a)(3)(ii)(A), however, a loan may have both an \n\"interest-only\" feature and a \"step-payment\" feature.\n\n38(a)(4) Total settlement charges.\n\n1. Disclosure required. For the good faith estimate required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(1)(i), the creditor must disclose the \namount of the \"Total Estimated Settlement Charges\" as disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate under Regulation X, \n12 CFR part 3500, Appendix C. For the final disclosure required by \u00a7 226.19(a)(2)(ii), the creditor must disclose the \nsum of the final settlement charges. For the final disclosure, the creditor may use the sum of the \"Charges That \nCannot Increase,\" \"Charges That In Total Cannot Increase By More Than 10%,\" and \"Charges That Can Change\" \nas would be disclosed in the column entitled \"HUD--1\" on page three of the HUD--1 or on page two of the HUD--1A \nsettlement statement under Regulation X, 12 CFR part 3500, Appendix A. Alternatively, for the final disclosure, the \ncreditor may provide the consumer with the final HUD--1 or HUD--1A settlement statement. For transactions in \nwhich a Good Faith Estimate, HUD--1 or HUD--1A are not required, the creditor may look to such documents for \nguidance on how to comply with the requirements of this section.\n\n38(a)(5) Prepayment penalty.\n\n\n\n1. Coverage. Section 226.38 (a)(5) applies only to those transactions in which the interest calculation takes account \nof all scheduled reductions in principal, as well as transactions in which interest calculations are made daily.\n\n2. Penalty. The term \"penalty\" as used in \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) encompasses only those charges that are assessed solely \nbecause of the prepayment in full of a transaction in which the interest calculation takes account of all scheduled \nreductions in principal. Charges which are penalties include, for example:\n\ni. Charges determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period after prepayment in full and applying \nthe interest rate to such \"balance.\"\n\nii. A minimum finance charge in a simple-interest transaction.\n\niii. Fees, such as loan closing costs, that are waived unless the consumer prepays the obligation.\n\n3. Fees that are not prepayment penalties. Charges which are not penalties include, for example:\n\ni. Loan guarantee fees.\n\nii. Fees imposed for preparing and providing documents in connection with prepayment, such as a loan payoff \nstatement, a reconveyance, or other document releasing the creditor's security interest in the property securing the \nloan.\n\n4. As applicable. When the legal obligation includes a finance charge computed from time to time by application of a \nrate to the unpaid principal balance and no penalty may be imposed, disclosures made under \u00a7 226.38(a)(5) need \nnot be made. In such a case, however, \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(iii) requires the creditor to indicate whether or not the legal \nobligation permits the creditor to impose a prepayment penalty.\n\n5. Content of disclosure. Section 226.38(a)(5) requires creditors to disclose the amount of the maximum penalty, \nthe circumstances under which the creditor may impose the penalty, and the period during which the creditor may \nimpose the penalty. The creditor must state the maximum penalty as a dollar numerical amount. See \u00a7 226.2(b)(5) \nand comment 2(b)(5)-2.\n\n6. Basis of disclosure. The creditor should assume that the consumer prepays at a time when the prepayment \npenalty may be charged. For example, if the prepayment penalty on a negatively amortizing loan equals 2% of the \namount prepaid during the first two years after loan origination, the creditor should disclose the maximum penalty \nusing the maximum loan balance during those years even if the loan balance, and thus the amount prepaid, may \nincrease thereafter. If more than one type of prepayment penalty applies, the creditor should include the maximum \namount of each type of prepayment penalty in the maximum penalty disclosed.\n\ni. If the legal obligation permits the creditor to treat the loan balance as outstanding for a period after prepayment in \nfull and charge amounts determined by applying the interest rate to the \"balance\" deemed outstanding during that \nperiod, the maximum the creditor should include is the maximum such charges in calculating the maximum \nprepayment penalty.\n\nii. If a minimum finance charge applies, the creditor should include the minimum finance charge in calculating the \nmaximum prepayment penalty.\n\niii. If a prepayment penalty is determined by applying to the loan balance at the time of prepayment a rate that does \nnot change, the prepayment penalty amount should be calculated assuming the highest balance possible. For \namortizing loans and interest-only loans, the balance is highest at consummation, assuming the consumer makes \ntimely payments in full. However, for loans with negative amortization, the loan's balance may be higher after \nconsummation. For example, assume the principal balance of a negatively amortizing loan is $ 200,000 at \nconsummation. The terms of the legal obligation allow the creditor to impose a fee equal to 3% of the amount \nprepaid if the consumer prepays during the first three years after consummation. The legal obligation provides that \nthe interest rate for the loan is 1.50% for the first month, the maximum interest rate is 10.50%, and there are no \n\n\n\nlimitations on how much the interest rate can increase on any adjustment date. Initial minimum payment amounts \nare based on the 1.5% initial rate. Payment amounts are adjusted yearly, but payments may not increase by more \nthan 7.5% on any adjustment date, except that the consumer must make fully amortizing payments starting with the \nperiod in which the principal balance reaches 115% of the original principal balance. Assuming that the interest rate \nincreases to 10.50% in the second month and remains at that rate and that the consumer makes minimum \npayments, the highest principal balance is $ 229,243, reached in the twenty-eighth month following origination. For \npurposes of this disclosure, the creditor should assume the consumer prepays in the 28th month, and the maximum \nprepayment penalty is $ 6,877.29.\n\niv. In some cases, the legal obligation may allow the creditor to determine the penalty using a penalty rate that may \nchange over time (such as where a prepayment penalty on an adjustable-rate loan equals six months' interest \npayments.) In such cases, the creditor should disclose (1) the penalty charged when the penalty rate is the highest \npossible or (2) the penalty charged when the balance is the highest possible, whichever is greater. For example, \nassume that the interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage will remain fixed for the first 3 years after \nconsummation and will adjust annually thereafter. The principal balance will be $ 200,000 at consummation and the \nloan amortizes. The initial interest rate on the loan is 5.625% and the maximum amount the interest rate can \nincrease upon any rate adjustment is 2 percentage points. The terms of the legal obligation permit the creditor to \nimpose a fee equal to 6 months' interest if the consumer prepays within the first 4 years. To determine the \nmaximum prepayment penalty, the creditor must disclose (1) the penalty when the balance is highest or (2) the \npenalty when the penalty rate is highest, whichever is greater. The balance would be highest at consummation \nbecause the loan amortizes. The interest due the 1st month after consummation is $ 937.50. Six times the interest \ndue in the first month is $ 5,625.00. The penalty rate would be highest in the 37th month after consummation, the \nfirst time the interest rate may increase during the period in which a prepayment penalty may be charged. Assuming \nthe interest rate increased as much as possible, by 2 percentage points, the monthly interest due in the 37th month \nis $ 1,218.69. Six times the interest due in the 37th month is $ 7,312.14. The maximum penalty is the maximum \npenalty when the balance is highest, or $ 7,312.14, which is greater than the maximum penalty when the penalty \nrate is highest, or $ 5,625.00.\n\n7. Timely payment assumed. The creditor may assume that the consumer makes payments on time and in the \namount required by the terms of the legal obligation and may disregard any possible differences resulting from the \nconsumer's payment patterns. See comment 17(c)(2)(i)--3. Where the terms of the obligation require a periodic \npayment that is not a fully amortizing payment, such as an interest only payment or a minimum payment that \ncauses the loan balance to increase, the creditor must base disclosures on the required periodic payment and may \nnot assume that the consumer will make payments that exceed the required payment.\n\n8. Rebate-penalty disclosure. A single transaction may involve both a finance charge computed by application of a \nrate to the unpaid balance and a finance charge that is precomputed or otherwise does not take into account each \nreduction in the principal balance (for example, mortgages with mortgage-guarantee insurance for which premiums \nare calculated on an annual basis and do not take into account monthly declines in the principal balance). See \ncomment 36(j)(6)-1. In these cases, disclosures about both prepayment rebates and penalties are required. Sample \nform H--15 in appendix H illustrates a mortgage transaction in which both rebate and penalty disclosures are \nnecessary, and associated commentary explains the assumptions used in generating the sample.\n\n38(b) Annual percentage rate.\n\nParagraph 38(b)(1).\n\n1. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the cost of the credit as an annual rate, expressed as a \npercentage and using the term \"annual percentage rate,\" plus a brief descriptive phrase as required under \u00a7 \n226.38(b)(1). Under \u00a7 226.37(c)(2), the annual rate, expressed as a percentage, must be more conspicuous than \nthe other required disclosures and in at least 16 point font.\n\nParagraph 38(b)(3).\n\n\n\n1. Applicable average prime offer rate and higher-priced loan threshold. Creditors must disclose the APR on the \nloan offered, the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction, and the higher priced loan threshold, for the \nweek in which the creditor provides the disclosure. The higher-priced loan threshold is 1.5 percentage points above \nthe comparable average prime offer rate for first lien loans, and 3.5 percentage points above the comparable \naverage prime offer rate for subordinate lien loans. The Board publishes a table at least weekly with average prime \noffer rates by transaction type and loan term. Creditors should follow the guidance on how to determine the \naverage prime offer rate and the higher-priced loan threshold in \u00a7 226.35(a)(2) and comments 35(a)(2)-1 through --\n4.\n\nParagraph 38(b)(4).\n\n1. Average per-period saving for 1 percentage-point reduction in the APR. Section 226.38(b)(4) requires creditors to \ndisclose the average per-period savings of a 1 percentage-point reduction in the APR disclosed in paragraph (b)(1). \nThe creditor should base this disclosure on the terms of the legal obligation, except that the creditor must reduce \nthe interest rate by one percentage point. If the legal obligation requires monthly payments, the creditor should \nidentify the savings as the \"average per-month\" savings.\n\n2. Examples. In both examples, assume the loan amount is $ 200,000 and the loan has a 30 year term with a total \nof 360 payments due monthly.\n\ni. Fixed-rate interest-only mortgage. Assume that the loan is a fixed-rate mortgage with the option to make interest-\nonly payments for the first 10 years of the loan. The interest rate is 6.5 percent. The total of payments disclosed \nunder \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) is $ 588,313.89. To calculate the average per-month savings, the creditor would reduce the \ninterest rate to 5.5 percent for the full 30 year term of the loan and calculate a hypothetical total of payments of $ \n540,627.21. The difference between the total of payments disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) and the hypothetical \ntotal of payments is $ 47,686.68. The creditor would divide $ 47,686.68 by the number of periods (360) and disclose \nan average per-month savings of $ 132.\n\nii. Adjustable-rate mortgage. Assume the loan is an ARM with a three-year introductory rate of 5.625 percent; the \nfully-indexed rate is 7.75 percent. At the end of the three year period, the interest rate will adjust, subject to a 2 \npercent rate cap. Thus, the interest rate in effect for year 4 is 7.625 percent. In year 5 the rate adjusts to the fully-\nindexed rate of 7.75 percent. The creditor should assume that the rate does not increase after it reaches the fully-\nindexed rate. The total of payments disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) is $ 585,778.09. To calculate the average per-\nmonth savings, the creditor would assume interest rates of 4.625 percent for the first 3 years; 6.625 percent for year \n4; and 6.75 percent for the remainder of the loan. Thus, the rates are reduced by 1 percentage point, but the \nmargin, periodic caps and other loan terms remain the same. The hypothetical total of payments is $ 537,087.61. \nThe difference between the total of payments disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(i) and the hypothetical total of \npayments is $ 48,690.48. The creditor would divide $ 48,690.48 by the number of periods (360) and disclose an \naverage per-month savings of $ 135.\n\n38(c) Interest rate and payment summary.\n\n1. In general. Section 226.38(c) prescribes format and content for disclosure of interest rates and monthly \npayments. The information in paragraph (c)(2)-(4) is required to be in the form of a table, except as provided \notherwise. The required format and content of the table vary depending primarily on whether the loan has negative \namortization. In all cases, however, the table should have no more than five vertical columns, showing applicable \ninterest rates; payments would be shown in horizontal rows. Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes \nof \u00a7 226.38(c) in \u00a7 226.38(c)(7).\n\n2. Amortizing loans. Loans described as amortizing in \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i) and 226.38(c)(3) include loans with interest-\nonly features that do not also have negative amortization features. (For rules relating to loans with balloon \npayments, see \u00a7 226.38(c)(5)). If an amortizing loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory rate (less \nthan the fully-indexed rate), creditors must provide a special explanation of introductory rates. See \u00a7 \n226.38(c)(2)(iii).\n\n\n\n3. Negative amortization. For loans with negative amortization, creditors should follow the rules in \u00a7\u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii) \nand 226.38(c)(4) in disclosing interest rates and monthly payments. Loans with negative amortization also require \nspecial explanatory disclosures about rates and payments. See \u00a7 226.38(c)(6). Loans with negative amortization \ninclude \"payment option\" loans, in which the consumer is permitted to make minimum payments that will cover only \nsome of the interest accruing each month. See also comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--6, regarding graduated-payment \nadjustable-rate mortgages.\n\n38(c)(2) Interest rates.\n\n38(c)(2)(i) Amortizing loans.\n\nParagraph 38(c)(2)(i)(A).\n\n1. Fixed rate loans--payment increases. Although the interest rate will not change after consummation for a fixed-\nrate loan, some fixed-rate loans may have periodic payments that increase after consummation. For example, the \nterms of the legal obligation may permit the consumer to make interest-only payments for a specified period such \nas the first five years after consummation. In such cases, the creditor must include the increased payment under \u00a7 \n226.38(c)(4)(ii)(B) in the payment row, and must show the interest rate in the column for that payment, even though \nthe rate has not changed since consummation. See also comment 17(c)(1)(iii)--7, regarding growth equity \nmortgages.\n\nParagraph 38(c)(2)(i)(B).\n\n1. ARMs and step-rate mortgages. Creditors must disclose more than one interest rate for ARMs and step-rate \nmortgages, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B). Creditors must assume that interest rates rise after \nconsummation, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation.\n\n2. Maximum interest rate at first adjustment--adjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages. The creditor must \ndisclose the maximum possible rate that could apply at the first scheduled adjustment in the interest rate. If there \nare no interest rate caps other than the maximum possible rate required under \u00a7 226.30, then the creditor should \ndisclose only the rate at consummation and the maximum possible rate. Such a table would only have two columns.\n\ni. For an adjustable rate mortgage, the creditor must take into account any interest rate caps when disclosing the \nmaximum interest rate at the first adjustment. The creditor must also disclose the date on which the first scheduled \nadjustment occurs.\n\nii. If the transaction is a step-rate mortgage, the creditor should disclose the rate that will apply after consummation. \nFor example, the legal obligation may provide that the rate is 6 percent for the first two years following \nconsummation, and then increases to 7 percent. The creditor should disclose the rate at first adjustment as 7 \npercent and the date on which the rate is scheduled to increase to 7 percent.\n\n3. Maximum interest rate at any time. The creditor must disclose the maximum rate that could apply at any time \nduring the term of the loan and the earliest date on which the maximum interest rate could apply.\n\ni. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, the creditor must take into account any interest rate caps in disclosing the \nmaximum possible interest rate. For example, if the legal obligation provides that at each annual adjustment the \nrate may increase by no more than 2 percentage points, the creditor must take this limit into account in determining \nthe earliest date on which the maximum possible rate may be reached.\n\nii. For a step-rate loan, the creditor should disclose the highest rate that could apply under the terms of the legal \nobligation.\n\nParagraph 38(c)(2)(i)(C).\n\n\n\n1. Payment increases. For some loans, the payment may increase following consummation for reasons unrelated to \nan interest rate adjustment. For example, an adjustable-rate mortgage may have an introductory fixed-rate for the \nfirst five years following consummation, and permit the borrower to make interest-only payments for the first three \nyears. Under \u00a7 26.38(c)(3)(ii)(B), the creditor must disclose the first payment of principal and interest. In such a \ncase, the creditor must also disclose the interest rate that corresponds to the first payment of principal and interest, \neven though the interest rate will not adjust after consummation. The table would show, from left to right: the \ninterest rate and payment at consummation with the payment itemized to show that the payment is being applied to \ninterest only; the interest rate and payment when the interest-only option ends; the maximum interest rate and \npayment at first adjustment; and the maximum possible interest rate and payment.\n\n38(c)(2)(ii) Loans with negative amortization.\n\n1. Rate at consummation. In all cases the interest rate in effect at consummation must be disclosed, even if it will \napply only for a short period such as one month.\n\n2. Rates for adjustable rate mortgages. The creditor must assume that interest rates rise as quickly as possible \nafter consummation, in accordance with any interest rate caps under the legal obligation. For ARMs with no interest \nrate caps except a maximum possible rate cap, creditors must assume that the interest rate reaches the maximum \npossible interest rate at first adjustment. For example, assume that the legal obligation provides for an interest rate \nat consummation of 1.5 percent. One month after consummation, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly \nthereafter, according to changes in the index. The consumer may make payments that cover only part of the \ninterest accruing each month, until the date the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance, or until \nthe 5th year after consummation, whichever comes first. The maximum possible rate is 10.5 percent. No other limits \non interest rate changes apply. The minimum required payment adjusts each year, and may increase by no more \nthan 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The creditor should disclose the transaction as follows. The \ncreditor should disclose the following rates and the dates when they are scheduled to occur: a rate of 1.5 percent \nfor the first month following consummation and the minimum payment; a rate of 10.5 percent, and the \ncorresponding minimum payment taking into account the 7.5 percent limit, at the beginning of the second year; the \nrate of 10.5 percent and the corresponding minimum payment taking into account the 7.5 percent limit, at the \nbeginning of the third year. The creditor must also disclose the rate of 10.5 percent, the fully amortizing payment, \nand the date on which the consumer must first make such a payment under the terms of the legal obligation.\n\nParagraph 38(c)(2)(iii).\n\n1. Introductory rate. In some adjustable-rate mortgages, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is lower than \nthe fully-indexed rate at consummation. For amortizing loans with an introductory rate, creditors must disclose the \ninformation required in 226.38(c)(2)(iii) directly below the table.\n\n38(c)(3) Payments for amortizing loans.\n\n1. Payments corresponding to interest rates. Creditors must disclose a payment that corresponds to each interest \nrate disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i)(A)--(C). Balloon payments, however, must be disclosed as provided in \u00a7 \n226.38(c)(5).\n\n2. Principal and interest payment amounts; examples.\n\ni. For fixed-rate interest-only transactions, \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(ii)(B) requires scheduled increases in the regular periodic \npayment amounts to be disclosed along with the date of the increase. For example, in a fixed rate interest-only \nloan, a scheduled increase in the payment amount from an interest-only payment to a fully amortizing payment \nmust be disclosed. Similarly, in a fixed-rate balloon loan, the balloon payment must be disclosed in accordance with \n\u00a7 226.38(c)(5).\n\n\n\nii. For adjustable-rate mortgage transactions, \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(A) requires that for each interest rate required to be \ndisclosed under \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(i) (the interest rate at consummation, the maximum rate at the first adjustment, and \nthe maximum possible rate) a corresponding payment amount must be disclosed.\n\niii. The format of the payment disclosure varies depending on whether all regular periodic payment amounts will \ninclude principal and interest, and whether there will be an escrow account for taxes and insurance.\n\n38(c)(3)(i)(C) Estimated amounts for taxes and insurance.\n\n1. Taxes and insurance. An estimated payment amount for taxes and insurance must be disclosed if the creditor will \nestablish an escrow account for such amounts. The payment amount must include estimated amounts for property \ntaxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by the creditor, such as insurance against loss of or \ndamage to property, or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of the property, or insurance protecting \nthe creditor against the consumer's default or other credit loss.\n\n2. Mortgage insurance. Payment amounts under \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i) should reflect the consumer's mortgage \ninsurance payments until the date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable \nlaw, even though the consumer may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. The payment \namount must reflect the terms of the legal obligation, as determined by applicable State or other law. For example, \nassume that under applicable law, mortgage insurance must terminate after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, \nand the creditor collects at closing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal obligation, the \ncreditor will include mortgage insurance premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed payments when the \ninsurance is terminated, payment amounts disclosed up to the 130th payment should reflect premium payments. If, \nunder the legal obligation, the creditor will apply the amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments, \npayments disclosed up to the 128th payment should reflect premium payments.\n\nParagraph 38(c)(3)(i)(D).\n\n1. Total monthly payment. For amortizing loans, each column should add up to a total estimated payment. The total \nestimated payment amount should be labeled. If periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the \nappropriate term such as \"quarterly\" or \"annually.\"\n\n38(c)(4) Payments for negative amortization loans.\n\n1. Table. Section 226.38(c)(1) provides that tables shall include only the information required in paragraph (c)(2)-\n(4). Thus, a table for a negative amortization loan must contain no more than two horizontal rows of payments and \nno more than five vertical columns of interest rates.\n\nParagraph 38(c)(4)(i).\n\n1. Minimum required payments. In one row of the table, the creditor must show the minimum required payment in \neach column, for each interest rate or adjustment required in \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii), except that under the last column \nthe fully amortizing payment must be shown and must be identified as the \"full payment.\" The payments in this row \nmust be calculated based on an assumption that the consumer makes the minimum required payment for as long \nas possible under the terms of the legal obligation. This row should be identified as the minimum payment option, \nand the statement required by \u00a7 226.38(c)(4)(i)(C) should be included in the heading for the row.\n\nParagraph 38(c)(4)(iii).\n\n1. Fully amortizing payments. In one row of the table, the creditor must show the fully amortizing payment for every \ninterest rate required in \u00a7 226.38(c)(2)(ii). The creditor must assume, for purposes of calculating the amounts in this \nrow that the consumer makes only fully amortizing payments.\n\n38(c)(5) Balloon payment.\n\n\n\n1. General. A balloon payment is one that is more than two times the regular periodic payment. A balloon payment \nmust be disclosed in a row under the table, unless the balloon payment coincides with an interest rate adjustment \nor a scheduled payment increase. In those cases, the balloon payment must be disclosed in the table.\n\n38(d) Key Questions About Risk.\n\n38(d)(1) Required disclosures.\n\n1. Disclosure of first rate or payment increase. Under \u00a7 226.38(d)(1)(i) and (ii), the creditor must disclose the \ncalendar month and year in which the first interest rate or payment increase may occur.\n\n38(d)(1)(iii) Prepayment penalty.\n\n1. Coverage. See comment 38(a)(5)-1 to determine whether there is a prepayment penalty.\n\n2. Penalty. See comment 38(a)(5)-2 for examples of charges that are prepayment penalties.\n\n3. Not penalty. See comment 38(a)(5)-3 for examples of charges that are not prepayment penalties.\n\n4. Basis of disclosure. Creditors may rely on comment 38(a)(5)-6 in determining the maximum prepayment penalty.\n\n5. Timely payment assumed. In accordance with comment 38(a)(5)-7, creditors may disregard any possible \ndifferences resulting from the consumer's payment patterns and may base disclosures on the required payment and \nnot an amortizing payment, if the loan has a negative amortization feature.\n\n38(d)(2) Additional disclosures.\n\n1. As applicable. The disclosures required by \u00a7 226.38(d)(2) need only be made as applicable. Any disclosure not \nrelevant to the loan may be omitted.\n\n38(d)(2)(iii) Balloon payment.\n\n1. The creditor must make the balloon payment disclosure if the loan program includes a payment schedule with \nregular periodic payments that when aggregated do not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance.\n\n38(d)(2)(iv) Demand feature.\n\n1. Disclosure requirements. The disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.38(d)(2)(iv) apply not only to transactions payable \non demand from the outset, but also to transactions that convert to a demand status after a stated period.\n\n2. Covered demand features. See comment 18(i)--2 for examples of covered demand features.\n\n38(e) Information about payments.\n\n38(e)(1) Rate calculation.\n\n1. Calculation. If the interest rate will be calculated based on an index, an identification of the index to which the \nrate is tied, the amount of any margin that will be added to the index, and any conditions or events on which the \nincrease is contingent must be disclosed. When no specific index is used, the factors used to determine any rate \nincrease must be disclosed. When the increase in the rate is discretionary, the fact that any increase is within the \ncreditor's discretion must be disclosed. When the index is internally defined (for example, by that creditor's prime \nrate), the creditor may comply with this requirement by providing either a brief description of that index or a \nstatement that any increase is in the discretion of the creditor.\n\n38(e)(2) Rate and payment change limits.\n\n\n\n1. Limitations on interest rate increases. Limitations include any maximum imposed on the amount of an increase in \nthe rate at any time, as well as any maximum on the total increase over the loan's term to maturity.\n\n2. Limitations on payment increases; negatively amortizing loans. Limitations include any limit imposed on the \nchange of a minimum payment amount whether or not the change is accompanied by an adjustment to the interest \nrate. Any conditions on the limitation on payment increases must also be disclosed. For example, some loan \nprograms provide that the minimum payment will not increase by more than a certain percentage, regardless of the \ncorresponding increase in the interest rate. However, there may be exceptions to the limitation on the payment \nincrease, such as if the consumer's principal balance reaches a certain threshold, or if the legal obligation sets out a \nscheduled time when payment increases will not be limited.\n\n38(e)(5)(i) Total payments.\n\n1. Calculation of total payments scheduled. Creditors should use the rules under \u00a7 226.18(g) and associated \ncommentary, and comments 17(c)(1)(iii)--1 and --3 for adjustable-rate transactions, to calculate the total payments \namount, except that the calculation of the total payments amount must include any amount required to be disclosed \nunder \u00a7 226.38(c)(3)(i)(C).\n\n2. Number of payments. See comment 18(g)--3.\n\n3. Demand obligations. In demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the creditor must make disclosure of \ntotal payments scheduled described in \u00a7 226.17(c)(5).\n\n38(e)(5)(ii) Interest and settlement charges.\n\n1. Calculation of interest and settlement charges. The interest and settlement charges disclosure is identical to the \nfinance charge, as calculated under \u00a7 226.4.\n\n2. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the interest and settlement charges as a dollar amount, using the \nterm interest and settlement charges, together with a brief statement as required by \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(ii). The interest \nand settlement charges must be disclosed only as a total amount; the components of the interest and settlement \ncharges amount may not be itemized in the segregated disclosures, except as permitted under \u00a7 226.38(a)(4), \nalthough the regulation does not prohibit itemization elsewhere.\n\n38(e)(5)(iii) Amount financed.\n\n1. Principal loan amount. In a mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 226.38, the principal loan amount is the same as \nthe loan amount disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(a)(1). As provided in that section, the loan amount is the principal \namount the consumer will borrow reflected in the loan contract. Thus the principal loan amount includes all amounts \nfinanced as part of the transaction, whether they are finance charges or not.\n\n2. Loan premiums and buydowns. In a mortgage transaction, the creditor may offer a premium in the form of cash \nor merchandise to prospective borrowers. Similarly, a third party, such as a real estate developer or other seller, \nmay offer to pay some portion of the consumer's costs of the credit transaction or to pay the creditor to \"buy down\" \nthe consumer's interest rate. Such premiums and buydowns must be reflected in accordance with the terms of the \nlegal obligation between the creditor and consumer. See \u00a7 226.17(c)(1) and comments 17(c)(1)--1, --2 and \n17(c)(1)(i)--1 through --4. Thus, if the creditor is legally obligated by the terms of the credit obligation to charge a \nreduced interest rate or reduced costs as a consequence of the premium or buydown, regardless of its source, the \ndisclosures, including the amount financed, should reflect those credit terms. Otherwise, the disclosures should be \ncalculated without regard to any such premium or buydown.\n\n3. Disclosure required. The net amount of credit extended must be disclosed using the term \"amount financed\" \ntogether with a descriptive statement as required by \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(iii).\n\n38(f)(4) Tax deductibility.\n\n\n\n1. Example. The creditor can use the following language to satisfy the requirements of this section: \"If you borrow \nmore than your home is worth, the interest on the extra amount may not be deductible for federal income tax \npurposes. Consult a tax advisor to find out whether the interest you pay is deductible.\"\n\n2. Applicability. If the creditor is not certain at the time of application whether the credit extended may exceed the \nfair market value of the dwelling, the creditor may, at its discretion, provide the disclosure required by this section in \nconnection with all applications for closed-end credit secured by a dwelling or real property.\n\n38(g) Identification of loan originator and creditor.\n\n38(g)(1) Creditor.\n\n1. Identification of creditor. The creditor making the disclosures must be identified. Use of the creditor's name is \nsufficient, but the creditor may also include an address and/or telephone number. In transactions with multiple \ncreditors, any one of them may make the disclosures; the one doing so must be identified.\n\n38(g)(2) Loan originator.\n\n1. Multiple loan originators. In transactions with multiple loan originators, each loan originator's unique identifier \nmust be disclosed. For example, in a transaction where a mortgage broker meets the definition of a loan originator \nunder the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, Section 1503(3), 12 U.S.C. 5102(3), \nthe identifiers for the broker and for its employee originator meeting that definition must be disclosed.\n\n38(h) Credit insurance and debt cancellation and debt suspension coverage.\n\n1. Location. This disclosure may, at the creditor's option, appear apart from the other disclosures. It may appear \nwith any other information, including the amount financed itemization, any information prescribed by State law, or \nother information. When this information is disclosed with the other segregated disclosures, however, no additional \nexplanatory material may be included.\n\nParagraph 38(h)(5).\n\n1. Compliance. If, based on the creditor's review of the consumer's age and/or employment status at the time of \nenrollment in the product, the consumer would not be eligible to receive the benefits of the product, then providing \nthe disclosure required under \u00a7 226.38(h)(5) would not comply with this provision. That is, if the consumer does not \nmeet the age and/or employment eligibility criteria, then the creditor cannot state that the consumer may be eligible \nto receive benefits and cannot comply with this requirement. If the creditor offers a bundled product (such as credit \nlife insurance combined with credit involuntary unemployment insurance) and the consumer is not eligible for all of \nthe bundled products, then providing the disclosure required under \u00a7 226.38(h)(5) would not comply with this \nprovision. However, the disclosure still satisfies the requirements of this section if an event subsequent to \nenrollment, such as the consumer passing the age limit of the product, makes the consumer ineligible for the \nproduct based on the product's age or employment eligibility restrictions.\n\n2. Reasonably reliable evidence. A disclosure under \u00a7 226.38(h)(5) shall be deemed to comply with this section if \nthe creditor used reasonably reliable evidence to determine whether the consumer met the age or employment \neligibility criteria of the product. Reasonably reliable evidence of a consumer's age would include using the date of \nbirth on the consumer's credit application, on the driver's license or other government-issued identification, or on the \ncredit report. Reasonably reliable evidence of a consumer's employment status would include a consumer's \nstatement on a credit application form, an Internal Revenue Service Form W--2, tax returns, payroll receipts, or \nother written evidence such as a letter or e-mail from the consumer or the consumer's employer.\n\n38(i) Required deposit.\n\n1. Disclosure required. The creditor must inform the consumer of the existence of a required deposit. (Appendix H \nprovides a model clause that may be used in making that disclosure.) Section 226.38(i)(1) and (2) describe two \n\n\n\ntypes of deposits that need not be considered required deposits. Use of the phrase \"need not\" permits creditors to \ninclude the disclosure even in cases where there is doubt as to whether the deposit constitutes a required deposit.\n\n2. Pledged-account mortgages. In these transactions, a consumer pledges as collateral funds that the consumer \ndeposits in an account held by the creditor. The creditor withdraws sums from that account to supplement the \nconsumer's periodic payments. Creditors may treat these pledged accounts as required deposits or they may treat \nthem as consumer buydowns in accordance with the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(1).\n\n3. Escrow accounts. The escrow exception in \u00a7 226.38(i) applies, for example, to accounts for such items as \nmaintenance fees, repairs, or improvements. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.17(c)(1) regarding the use of escrow \naccounts in consumer buydown transactions.)\n\n4. Interest-bearing accounts. When a deposit earns at least 5 percent interest per year, no disclosure is required. \nThis exception applies whether the deposit is held by the creditor or by a third party.\n\n5. Examples of amounts excluded. The following are among the types of deposits that need not be treated as \nrequired deposits:\n\ni. Requirement that a borrower be a customer or a member even if that involves a fee or a minimum balance.\n\nii. Required property insurance escrow on a mobile home transaction.\n\niii. Refund of interest when the obligation is paid in full.\n\niv. Deposits that are immediately available to the consumer.\n\nv. Funds deposited with the creditor to be disbursed (for example, for construction) before the loan proceeds are \nadvanced.\n\nvi. Escrow of condominium fees.\n\nvii. Escrow of loan proceeds to be released when the repairs are completed.\n\n38(j) Separate disclosures.\n\n38(j)(1) Itemization of amount financed.\n\n1. Compliance alternatives. The creditor has three alternatives in complying with \u00a7 226.38(j)(1). Under all three \nalternatives, the itemization (or its substitute) must be provided at the same time as the other disclosures required \nby \u00a7 226.38, although separate from those disclosures. The three alternatives are as follows:\n\ni. The creditor may provide an itemization as a matter of course, without notifying the consumer of the right to \nreceive the itemization.\n\nii. The creditor may inform the consumer, as part of the segregated disclosures, that a written itemization of the \namount financed will be provided on request, furnishing the itemization only if the consumer in fact requests it.\n\niii. The creditor may substitute the GFE or HUD--1 settlement statement for the itemization. See comment \n38(j)(1)(iii)--1 for additional guidance on this alternative.\n\nParagraph 38(j)(1)(i).\n\n1. Additional information. Section 226.38(j)(1)(i) establishes a minimum standard for the information to be included \nin the itemization of the amount financed. Creditors have considerable flexibility in revising or supplementing the \ninformation listed in \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i). The creditor may, for example, do one or more of the following:\n\n\n\ni. Include amounts that reflect payments not part of the amount financed. For example, costs of the transaction that \nthe consumer pays directly, rather than out of loan proceeds, may be included.\n\nii. Organize the categories in any order. For example, the creditor may rearrange the terms in a mathematical \nprogression that depicts the arithmetic relationship of the terms.\n\niii. Further itemize each category. For example, the amount paid directly to the consumer may be subdivided into \nthe amount given by check and the amount credited to the consumer's savings account.\n\niv. Label categories with different language from that shown in \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i). For example, an amount paid on \nthe consumer's account may be revised to identify the account specifically as \"your existing mortgage loan with \nus.\"\n\nv. Delete, leave blank, mark \"N/A,\" or otherwise note inapplicable categories in the itemization. For example, in a \nmortgage transaction to finance the purchase of a dwelling with no proceeds distributed directly to the consumer or \namount credited to the consumer's account with the creditor, the amount financed may consist of only the amounts \npaid to others and the prepaid finance charge. In this case, the itemization may be composed of only those \ncategories, and the other categories may be eliminated.\n\n2. Amounts appropriate to more than one category. When an amount may appropriately be placed in any of several \ncategories and the creditor does not wish to revise the categories shown in \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i), the creditor has \nconsiderable flexibility in determining where to reflect the amount. For example, in a mortgage transaction to \nrefinance an existing mortgage held by the same creditor with additional proceeds paid to the consumer, the portion \nof the proceeds used to pay off the existing mortgage debt may be treated as either an amount paid to the \nconsumer or an amount paid on the consumer's account. If the existing mortgage is held by another creditor, the \nportion of the proceeds used to pay it off may be treated as either an amount paid to the consumer or an amount \npaid to others on the consumer's behalf.\n\nParagraph 38(j)(1)(i)(A).\n\n1. Amounts paid to consumer. This category encompasses funds given to the consumer in the form of cash or a \ncheck, including joint proceeds checks, as well as funds placed in an asset account. It may include money in an \ninterest-bearing account even if that amount is considered a required deposit under \u00a7 226.38(i). For example, in a \ntransaction with total loan proceeds of $ 50,000, assume the consumer receives a check for $ 30,000 and $ 20,000 \nis required by the creditor to be put into an interest-bearing account. Whether or not the $ 20,000 is a required \ndeposit, it is part of the amount financed. At the creditor's option, it may be broken out and labeled in the itemization \nof the amount financed.\n\nParagraph 38(j)(1)(i)(B).\n\n1. Amounts credited to consumer's account. The term consumer's account refers to an account in the nature of a \ndebt with that creditor. It may include, for example, an unpaid balance on a prior loan or other amounts owing to \nthat creditor. It does not include asset accounts of the consumer such as savings or checking accounts.\n\nParagraph 38(j)(1)(i)(C).\n\n1. Amounts paid to others. This category includes, for example, title fees; amounts paid to insurance companies for \ninsurance premiums; security interest fees; and amounts paid to credit bureaus, appraisers, and public officials. \nWhen several types of insurance premiums are financed, they may, at the creditor's option, be combined and listed \nin one sum, labeled \"insurance\" or similar term. This includes, but is not limited to, different types of insurance \npremiums paid to one company and different types of insurance premiums paid to different companies. Except for \ninsurance companies and other categories noted in \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i)(C), third parties must be identified by name.\n\nParagraph 38(j)(1)(i)(D).\n\n\n\n1. Prepaid finance charge. Prepaid finance charges that are subtracted from the loan amount to calculate the \namount financed, under \u00a7 226.38(e)(5)(iii), must be disclosed under \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i)(D). The prepaid finance \ncharges must be shown as a total amount but, at the creditor's option, also may be further itemized and described. \nAll amounts must be reflected in this total, even if portions of the prepaid finance charge are also reflected \nelsewhere. For example, if at consummation the creditor collects interim interest of $ 30 and an underwriting fee of \n$ 100, a total prepaid finance charge of $ 130 must be shown. At the creditor's option, the underwriting fee paid to \na third party also may be shown elsewhere as an amount included in \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i)(C). The creditor also may \nfurther describe the two components of the prepaid finance charge, although no itemization of this element is \nrequired by \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i)(D).\n\n2. Prepaid finance charges placed in escrow. RESPA requires creditors to give consumers a settlement statement \ndisclosing the costs associated with mortgage loan transactions. Included on the settlement statement are \npayments into an escrow account for items that are prepaid finance charges. In calculating the total amount of \nprepaid finance charges, creditors should use the amounts listed on the respective lines of the settlement statement \nfor each of those items, without adjustment, even if the actual amount collected at settlement may vary because of \nRESPA's escrow accounting rules. Figures for such items disclosed in conformance with RESPA shall be deemed \nto be accurate for purposes of Regulation Z.\n\nParagraph 38(j)(1)(iii).\n\n1. RESPA disclosures. RESPA requires creditors to provide a good faith estimate of closing costs and a settlement \nstatement listing the amounts paid by the consumer. For transactions subject to \u00a7 226.38, whether or not they are \nsubject to RESPA, the creditor can satisfy \u00a7 226.38(j)(1) if the creditor complies with RESPA's requirements for a \ngood faith estimate and settlement statement. The itemization of the amount financed need not be given, even \nthough the content of the good faith estimate and HUD--1 settlement statement under RESPA differs from the \nrequirements of \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(i). If a creditor chooses to substitute RESPA's settlement statement for the \nitemization when redisclosure is required under \u00a7 226.19(a)(2), however, the statement must be provided to the \nconsumer at the time required by that section.\n\n38(j)(2) Rebate.\n\n1. Disclosure required. The creditor must give a definitive statement of whether or not a rebate will be given. If a \nrefund is possible for one type of prepayment, even though not for all, a positive disclosure is required. This applies \nto any type of prepayment, whether voluntary or involuntary as in the case of prepayments resulting from \nacceleration.\n\n2. Rebate-penalty disclosure. Creditors may rely on comment 38(a)(5)--8 in determining how to disclose both a \nprepayment penalty and a rebate in a single transaction. Sample form H--15 in Appendix H illustrates a mortgage \ntransaction in which both rebate and penalty disclosures are necessary.\n\n3. Prepaid finance charge. The existence of a prepaid finance charge in a transaction does not, by itself, require a \ndisclosure under \u00a7 226.38(j)(2). A prepaid finance charge is not considered a rebate under \u00a7 226.38(j)(2). At its \noption, however, a creditor may consider a prepaid finance charge to be a rebate under \u00a7 226.38(j)(2). If a \ndisclosure is made under \u00a7 226.38(j)(2) with respect to a prepaid finance charge or other finance charge, the \ncreditor may further identify that finance charge. For example, the disclosure may state that the borrower \"will not \nbe entitled to a refund of the prepaid finance charge\" or some other term that describes the finance charge.\n\n4. Rebate of finance charge. This applies to any finance charges that do not take account of each reduction in the \nprincipal balance of an obligation.\n\ni. This category includes, for example:\n\nA. Precomputed finance charges such as add-on charges.\n\n\n\nB. Charges that take account of some but not all reductions in principal, such as mortgage guarantee insurance \nassessed on the basis of an annual declining balance, when the principal is reduced on a monthly basis.\n\nii. No description of the method of computing earned or unearned finance charges is required or permitted as part of \nthe segregated disclosures under this section.\n\n38(j)(3) Late payment.\n\n1. Definition. This paragraph requires a disclosure only if charges are added to individual delinquent installments by \na creditor who otherwise considers the transaction ongoing on its original terms. Late payment charges do not \ninclude:\n\ni. The right of acceleration.\n\nii. Fees imposed for actual collection costs, such as repossession charges or attorney's fees.\n\niii. Deferral and extension charges.\n\niv. The continued accrual of simple interest at the contract rate after the payment due date. However, an increase in \nthe interest rate is a late payment charge to the extent of the increase.\n\n2. Content of disclosure. Many State laws authorize the calculation of late charges on the basis of either a \npercentage or a specified dollar amount, and permit imposition of the lesser or greater of the 2 charges. The \ndisclosure made under \u00a7 226.38(j)(3) may reflect this alternative. For example, stating that the charge in the event \nof a late payment is 5% of the late amount, not to exceed $ 5.00, is sufficient.\n\n38(j)(5) Contract reference.\n\n1. Content. Creditors may substitute, for the phrase \"loan contract,\" a reference to specific transaction documents in \nwhich the additional information is found, such as \"promissory note.\" A creditor may, at its option, delete \ninapplicable items in the contract reference.\n\n38(j)(6) Assumption policy.\n\n1. Policy statement. In many mortgages, the creditor cannot determine, at the time disclosure must be made, \nwhether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause \ncommonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan \nMortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors such as the creditworthiness of the \nsubsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the lender's security, and execution of an assumption \nagreement by the subsequent borrower. In cases where uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a \nmortgage, the disclosure under \u00a7 226.38(j)(6) should reflect that fact. In making disclosures in such cases, the \ncreditor may use phrases such as \"subject to conditions,\" \"under certain circumstances,\" or \"depending on future \nconditions.\" The creditor may provide a brief reference to more specific criteria such as a due-on-sale clause, \nalthough a complete explanation of all conditions is not appropriate. For example, the disclosure may state, \"If you \nsell your home after you take out this loan, we may permit the new buyer to take over the payments on your \nmortgage, subject to certain conditions, such as payment of an assumption fee.\" See comment 17(a)(1)-5 for an \nexample of a reference to a due-on-sale clause.\n\n2. Original terms. The phrase \"original terms\" for purposes of section 226.38(j)(6) does not preclude the imposition \nof an assumption fee, but a modification of the basic credit agreement, such as a change in the contract interest \nrate, represents different terms.\n\n* * * *\n\n\n\nAppendices G and H--Open-End and Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses\n\n1. Permissible Changes. Although use of the model forms and clauses is not required, creditors using them properly \nwill be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to those disclosures. Creditors may make certain \nchanges in the format or content of the forms and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a \ntransaction or a plan without losing the act's protection from liability. [,except] However, formatting changes may not \nbe made to the following model forms, model clauses, and samples in Appendices G and H: G--2[(A)], G--3[(A)], G-\n-4[(A)], G--10(A)--(E), G--14(A)--(E), G--15(A)--(D), G--17(A)--(D), G--18(A) (except as permitted pursuant to \u00a7 \n226.7(b)(2)), G--18(B)--(C), G--19, G--20, [and]G--21, G--22(A)--(B), G--23(A)--(B), G--24(A) (except as permitted \npursuant to \u00a7 226.7(a)(2)), G--25, and G--26; and H--4(B) through H--4(L), H--17(A) through (D), H--19(A)--(I), and \nH--20 through H--22. The rearrangement of the model forms and clauses may not be so extensive as to affect the \nsubstance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses. Creditors making revisions with that effect will \nlose their protection from civil liability. Except as otherwise specifically required, acceptable changes include, for \nexample:\n\ni. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in referring to the borrower.\n\nii. Using \"borrower\" and \"creditor\" instead of pronouns.\n\niii. Rearranging the sequences of the disclosures.\n\niv. Not using bold type for headings.\n\nv. Incorporating certain state \"plain English\" requirements.\n\nvi. Deleting inapplicable disclosures by whiting out, blocking out, filling in \"N/A\" (not applicable) or \"0,\" crossing out, \nleaving blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable items. (This should permit use of \nmultipurpose standard forms for transactions not secured by real property or a dwelling.)\n\n[vii. Using a vertical, rather than a horizontal, format for the boxes in the closed-end disclosures.]\n\n2. Debt cancellation coverage. This regulation does not authorize creditors to characterize debt cancellation or debt \nsuspension fees as insurance premiums for purposes of this regulation. Creditors may provide a disclosure that \nrefers to debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage whether or not the coverage is considered insurance. \nCreditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage \nconstitutes insurance under State law.\n\n* * * *\n\nAppendix H--Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses\n\n1. Models H--1 and H--2. Creditors may make several types of changes to closed-end model forms H--1 (credit \nsale) and H--2 (loan) and still be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation, provided that the required \ndisclosures are made clearly and conspicuously. Permissible changes include the addition of the information \npermitted by [footnote 37 to] section 226.17 and \"directly related\" information as set forth in the commentary to \nsection 226.17(a).\n\nThe creditor may also delete, or on multi-purpose forms, indicate inapplicable disclosures, such as:\n\n. The itemization of the amount financed option (See sample[s] H--12 [through H--15].)\n\n. The credit [life and disability] insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage disclosures (See model \nclauses and samples H-[11] 17(A) and H--17(C) and H-[12] 17(B) and H--17(D).)\n\n\n\n. The property insurance disclosures (See model clause H--18, and samples H--10 through H--12[, and H--14].)\n\n. The \"filing fees\" and \"nonfiling insurance\" disclosures (See samples H--11 and H--12.)\n\n. The prepayment penalty or rebate disclosures (See sample[s] H--12 [and H--14].)\n\n. The total sale price (See samples H--11 through H-[15] 12.)\n\nOther permissible changes include:\n\n. Adding the creditor's address or telephone number. (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.18(a).)\n\n. Combining required terms where several numerical disclosures are the same, for instance, if the \"total of \npayments\" equals the \"total sale price.\" (See the commentary to \u00a7 226.18.)\n\n. Rearranging the sequence or location of the disclosures--for instance, by placing the descriptive phrases outside \nthe boxes containing the corresponding disclosures, or by grouping the descriptors together as a glossary of terms \nin a separate section of the segregated disclosures; by placing the payment schedule at the top of the form; or by \nchanging the order of the disclosures in the boxes, including the annual percentage rate and finance charge boxes.\n\n. Using brackets, instead of checkboxes, to indicate inapplicable disclosures.\n\n. Using a line for the consumer to initial, rather than a checkbox, to indicate an election to receive an itemization of \nthe amount financed.\n\n. Deleting captions for disclosures.\n\n. Using a symbol, such as an asterisk, for estimated disclosures, instead of an \"e.\"\n\n. Adding a signature line to the insurance disclosures to reflect joint policies.\n\n. Separately itemizing the filing fees.\n\n. Revising the late charge disclosure in accordance with the commentary to \u00a7 226.18(l).\n\n2. Model H--3. Except as otherwise specifically provided, [C] creditors have considerable flexibility in filling out \nmodel H--3 (itemization of the amount financed). Appropriate revisions, such as those set out in the commentary to \nsection 226.18(c), or section 226.38(j)(1) for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, may be made to \nthis form without loss of protection from civil liability for proper use of the model forms.\n\n3. Models H--4(A) [through], H--4(C), H--4(H), H--5, H--7, H--16, H--17(A), H--17(C), H--18, and H--20 through H--\n23. The model clauses are not included in the model forms although they are mandatory for certain transactions. \nCreditors using the model clauses when applicable to a transaction are deemed to be in compliance with the \nregulation with regard to that disclosure.\n\n4. Model H--4(A). This model contains the variable-rate model clauses applicable to transactions subject to section \n226.18(f)[(1)] and is intended to give creditors considerable flexibility in structuring variable-rate disclosures to fit \nindividual plans. The information about circumstances, limitations, and effects of an increase may be given in terms \nof the contract interest rate or the annual percentage rate. Clauses are shown for hypothetical examples based on \nthe specific amount of the transaction and based on a representative amount. Creditors may preprint the variable-\nrate disclosures based on a representative amount for similar types of transactions, instead of constructing an \nindividualized example for each transaction. In both representative examples and transaction-specific examples, \ncreditors may refer either to the incremental change in rate, payment amount, or number of payments, or to the \nresulting rate, payment amount, or number of payments. For example, creditors may state that the rate will increase \nby 2 percent, with a corresponding $ 150 increase in the payment, or creditors may state that the rate will increase \nto 16 percent, with a corresponding payment of $ 850.\n\n\n\n5. Model H--4(B) and Samples H--4(D) through (F). [This model clause illustrates the variable-rate disclosure \nrequired under section 226.18(f)(2), which would alert consumers to the fact that the transaction contains a \nvariable-rate feature and that disclosures were provided earlier] Model H--4(B) illustrates, in the tabular format, the \ndisclosures required under section 226.19(b) for adjustable-rate transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. \nThe model form alerts consumers to risky features of the specific adjustable-rate mortgage program, and includes \ninformation on how the interest rate is determined and how it can change over time. The model form also directs \nthe consumer to a Web site to obtain additional information on adjustable-rate programs or to find a list of licensed \nhousing counselors. Samples H--4(D) through (F) illustrate how to adapt the model form and clauses contained in \nappendix H--4(B) and H--4(C) to the creditor's own particular adjustable-rate program. Except as otherwise \npermitted, disclosures must be substantially similar in sequence and format to Model H--4(B). See comment app. H-\n-18 regarding formatting details for samples H--4(D) through H--4(F).\n\n6. Model H--4(C). Th[is] e model clauses illustrate[s] certain [the] early disclosures required generally under \n226.19(b). [It] They include[s] information on how the consumer's interest rate is determined and how it can change \nover the term of the loan when there is carryover interest, a conversion feature, or a preferred rate [, and explains \nchanges that may occur in the borrower's monthly payment. It contains an example of how to disclose historical \nchanges in the index or formula values used to compute interest rates for the preceding 15 years. The model clause \nalso illustrates the disclosure of the initial and maximum interest rates and payments based on an initial interest rate \n(index value plus margin, adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an identified month \nand year for the loan program disclosure and illustrates how to provide consumers with a method for calculating the \nmonthly payment for the loan amount to be borrowed].\n\n7. Models H--4[D](G), (H), and (K), and Samples H--4(I) and (J). [This model] Model H--4(G), and model clauses \ncontained in H--4(H), illustrate[s], in the tabular format, the disclosures [the adjustment notice] required under \nsection 226.20(c) [and provides] regarding interest rate adjustment notices for adjustable rate transactions secured \nby real property or a dwelling. Model H--4(K) illustrates an annual notice of interest rate change without any \ncorresponding change to payment. Samples H--4(I) and (J) provide examples of payment-change notices [and \nannual notices of interest-rate changes] for an interest-only, adjustable rate transaction and a hybrid adjustable rate \ntransaction, respectively. Except as otherwise permitted, disclosures must be substantially similar in sequence and \nformat to Models H--4(G) or H--4(K).\n\n8. Model H--5. This contains the demand feature clause.\n\n9. Model H--6. [This contains the assumption clause.] Reserved\n\n10. Model H--7. This contains the required deposit clause.\n\n11. Models H--8 and H--9. These models contain the rescission notices for a typical closed-end transaction and a \nrefinancing, respectively. The last paragraph of each model form contains a blank for the date by which the \nconsumer's notice of cancellation must be sent or delivered. A parenthetical is included to address the situation in \nwhich the consumer's right to rescind the transaction exists beyond 3 business days following the date of the \ntransaction, for example, where the notice or material disclosures are delivered late or where the date of the \ntransaction in paragraph 1 of the notice is an estimate. The language of the parenthetical is not optional. See the \ncommentary to section 226.2(a)(25) regarding the specificity of the security interest disclosure for model form H--9. \nThe prior version of model form H--9 is substantially similar to the current version and creditors may continue to use \nit, as appropriate. Creditors are encouraged, however, to use the current version when reordering or reprinting \nforms.\n\n12. Sample forms. [The sample forms] Samples [(]H--4(D) through H-(F), H4(I) and H--4(J), H--10 through H-[15] \n12, H--17(B) and H--17(D), and H--19(D) through (I)[)] serve a different purpose than the model forms and model \nclauses. The samples illustrate various ways of adapting the model forms to the individual transactions described in \nthe commentary to appendix H. The deletions and rearrangements shown relate only to the specific transactions \n\n\n\ndescribed. As a result, the samples do not provide the general protection from civil liability provided by the model \nforms and clauses.\n\n13. Sample H--10. This sample illustrates an automobile credit sale. The cash price is $ 7,500 with a downpayment \nof $ 1,500. There is an 8% add-on interest rate and a term of 3 years, with 36 equal monthly payments. The credit \nlife insurance premium and the filing fees are financed by the creditor. There is a $ 25 credit report fee paid by the \nconsumer before consummation, which is a prepaid finance charge.\n\n14. Sample H--11. This sample illustrates an installment loan. The amount of the loan is $ 5,000. There is a 12% \nsimple interest rate and a term of 2 years. The date of the transaction is expected to be April 15, 1981, with the first \npayment due on June 1, 1981. The first payment amount is labelled as an estimate since the transaction date is \nuncertain. The odd days' interest ($ 26.67) is collected with the first payment. The remaining 23 monthly payments \nare equal.\n\n15. Sample H--12. This sample illustrates a refinancing and consolidation loan. The amount of the loan is $ 5,000. \nThere is a 15% simple interest rate and a term of 3 years. The date of the transaction is April 1, 1981, with the first \npayment due on May 1, 1981. The first 35 monthly payments are equal, with an odd final payment. The credit \ndisability insurance premium is financed. In calculating the annual percentage rate, the U.S. Rule has been used. \nSince an itemization of the amount financed is included with the disclosures, the statement regarding the \nconsumer's option to receive an itemization is deleted.\n\n16. Samples H--[13] 19(D) through H--[15] 19(I). These samples illustrate various mortgage transactions. They \nassume that the mortgages are subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). As a result, no \noption regarding the itemization of the amount financed has been included in the samples, because providing the \ngood faith estimates of settlement costs required by RESPA satisfies Truth in Lending's amount financed \nitemization requirement. (See [footnote 39 to \u00a7 226.18(c)] \u00a7 226.38(j)(1)(iii).)\n\n17. Sample H--[13]16. This sample illustrates the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.32(c)(1) through (5). The sample \nillustrates notices, the amount borrowed, and the disclosures about optional insurance that are required for \nmortgage refinancings under \u00a7 226.32(c)(5). The sample also includes disclosures required under \u00a7 226.32(c)(3) \nwhen the legal obligation includes a balloon payment. [This sample illustrates a mortgage with a demand feature. \nThe loan amount is $ 44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. The 15 days \nof interim interest ($ 294.34) is collected as a prepaid finance charge at the time of consummation of the loan (April \n15, 1981). In calculating the disclosure amounts, the minor irregularities provision in \u00a7 226.17(c)(4) has been used. \nThe property insurance premiums are not included in the payment schedule. This disclosure statement could be \nused for notes with the 7-year call option required by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) in states \nwhere due-on-sale clauses are prohibited.]\n\n18. [Sample H--14] Models H--19(A) through H--19(C).i. These model forms illustrate, in the tabular format, the \ndisclosures required generally under \u00a7 226.38(a) through 226.38(j) for transactions secured by real property or a \ndwelling. Creditors can use model H--19(A) for fixed-rate mortgage loans subject to \u00a7 226.38; model H--19(B) for \nadjustable-rate mortgages subject to \u00a7 226.38; and model H--19(C) for mortgages that are negatively amortizing \nand subject to \u00a7 226.38.\n\nii. Except as otherwise permitted, disclosures must be substantially similar in sequence and format to model forms \nH--19(A) through (C), as applicable.\n\niii. Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the \u00a7\u00a7 226.19(b), 226.20(c), \n226.20(d) or 226.38 disclosures, samples H--4(D) through H--(F), and H--19(D) through H--19(I) are designed to be \nprinted on an 8 x 11 1/2 sheet of paper. In addition, the following formatting techniques were used in presenting the \ninformation in the sample forms to ensure that the information is readable:\n\nA. A readable font style and font size (10-point Arial font style, except for the annual percentage rate which is \nshown in 16-point type);\n\n\n\nB. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text;\n\nC. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words, the text was not compressed to appear smaller \nthan 10-point type, except the headings in the tabular format used to provide the interest rate and payment \ndisclosures required under \u00a7 226.38(c), which are shown in 9-point type;\n\nD. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each row, by providing sufficient margins above, \nbelow and to the sides of the text;\n\nE. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Generally, black text was used on white paper.\n\niv. The Board is not requiring creditors to use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the \ntabular format or scaled graph (except for the 10-point and 16-point minimum font requirements); however, the \nBoard encourages creditors to consider these techniques when disclosing information in the table or scaled graph \nto ensure that the information is presented in a readable format. [This sample disclosure form illustrates the \ndisclosures under \u00a7 226.19(b) for a variable-rate transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a \nterm greater than one year. The sample form shows a creditor how to adapt the model clauses in appendix H--\n4(C) to the creditor's own particular variable-rate program. The sample disclosure form describes the features of a \nspecific variable-rate mortgage program and alerts the consumer to the fact that information on the creditor's other \nclosed-end variable-rate programs is available upon request. It includes information on how the interest rate is \ndetermined and how it can change over time. Section 226.19(b)(2)(viii) permits creditors the option to provide either \na historical example or an initial and maximum interest rates and payments disclosure; both are illustrated in the \nsample disclosure. The historical example explains how the monthly payment can change based on a $ 10,000 \nloan amount, payable in 360 monthly installments, based on historical changes in the values for the weekly average \nyield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. Index values are measured for 15 \nyears, as of the first week ending in July. This reflects the requirement that the index history be based on values for \nthe same date or period each year in the example. The sample disclosure also illustrates the alternative disclosure \nunder \u00a7 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(B) that the initial and the maximum interest rates and payments be shown for a $ 10,000 \nloan originated at an initial interest rate of 12.41 percent (which was in effect July 1996) and to have 2 percentage \npoint annual (and 5 percentage point overall) interest rate limitations or caps. Thus, the maximum amount that the \ninterest rate could rise under this program is 5 percentage points higher than the 12.41 percent initial rate to 17.41 \npercent, and the monthly payment could rise from $ 106.03 to a maximum of $ 145.34. The loan would not reach \nthe maximum interest rate until its fourth year because of the 2 percentage point annual rate limitations, and the \nmaximum payment disclosed reflects the amortization of the loan during that period. The sample form also \nillustrates how to provide consumers with a method for calculating their actual monthly payment for a loan amount \nother than $ 10,000.]\n\n19. Sample H--[15] 19(D). This sample illustrates the disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 for a fixed rate mortgage with a \nshared-equity feature. The loan amount is $ 210,000, payable in 36 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of \n5.50%. The date of the transaction is March 26, 2009, and the sample assumes the average prime offer rate for the \nweek of March 23, 2009 is 5.66%. There is a balloon payment of $ 202,217.84 due in March 2012. The taxes and \nproperty insurance premiums are not escrowed, and therefore, are shown as not included in the interest rate and \npayment summary table required under \u00a7 226.38(c). [This sample illustrates a graduated payment mortgage with a \n5-year graduation period and a 7 1/2 percent yearly increase in payments. The loan amount is $ 44,900, payable in \n360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. Two points ($ 898), as well as an initial mortgage \nguarantee insurance premium of $ 225.00, are included in the prepaid finance charge. The mortgage guarantee \ninsurance premiums are calculated on the basis of 1/4 of 1% of the outstanding principal balance under an annual \nreduction plan. The abbreviated disclosure permitted under \u00a7 226.18(g)(2) is used for the payment schedule for \nyears 6 through 30. The prepayment disclosure refers to both penalties and rebates because information about \npenalties is required for the simple interest portion of the obligation and information about rebates is required for the \nmortgage insurance portion of the obligation.]\n\n\n\n20.

This sample illustrates the disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 for a step-payment mortgage with a \nseven-year step period and a 4 percent annual payment cap. This sample does not offer payment options. The \nconsumer is required to make minimum payments for the first seven years; the minimum payments cover no \nprincipal and only some interest for the first two years and therefore, the mortgage has a negative amortization \nfeature. Fully amortizing payments begin in year eight. The loan amount is $ 200,000, payable in 360 monthly \ninstallments at a simple interest rate of 6.50%. The date of the transaction is February 4, 2009, and the sample \nassumes the average prime offer rate for the week of February 2, 2009 is 5.75%. The taxes and property insurance \nare escrowed, and therefore, a statement of the amount of estimated taxes and insurance is included in the interest \nrate and payment summary disclosure required under \u00a7 226.38(c)(6)(i).\n\n22. Sample H--19(G). This sample illustrates the disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 for a hybrid adjustable rate mortgage \nwith a prepayment penalty that is in effect for the first 2 years.

The date of the \ntransaction is February 26, 2009, and the sample assumes the average prime offer rate for the week of February \n23, 2009 is 6.50%. The taxes and property insurance premiums are escrowed, and therefore, are shown as \nincluded in the total estimated monthly payment in interest rate and payment summary table required under \u00a7 \n226.38(c).\n\n23. Sample H--19(H). This sample illustrates the disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 for a hybrid adjustable rate mortgage. \nThe loan has an interest only payment option for the first 5 years, and a prepayment penalty that is in effect for the \nfirst 2 years. The loan amount is $ 200,000, payable in 360 monthly installments, with an initial discounted rate of \n6.875% that is fixed for the first 5 years.

Sample H--19(I). This sample illustrates the disclosures under \u00a7 226.38 for an adjustable-rate mortgage with \npayment options. The loan amount is $ 200,000 and payable in 360 monthly installments. The loan has an initial 1-\nmonth introductory rate of 1.5% that adjusts to the maximum of 10.5% in the second month of the loan. The date of \nthe transaction is February 4, 2009, and the sample assumes the average prime offer rate for the week of February \n2, 2009 is 4.75%. The minimum payment option has an annual payment cap of 7.5% and can be made until the \nloan recasts at 115% of the original loan amount. This sample assumes only minimum payments are made until the \nloan recasts in June 2011, when fully amortizing payments of $ 2,402.54 would be required. The taxes and property \ninsurance are escrowed, and therefore, a statement of the amount of estimated taxes and insurance is included in \nthe interest rate and payment summary disclosure required under \u00a7 226.38(c)(6)(i).\n\n25.

This \nmeans that your monthly payments could increase.\n\n2 Can my monthly payment increase?\n\nWith some loans, your monthly payment could increase after a period of time, often by hundreds of dollars. This \nincrease could be because you have a lower introductory interest rate, your property taxes or insurance premiums \nincrease, or because in the beginning your monthly payment only covers the interest on the loan, and not the \nprincipal owed.\n\n3 Will my monthly payments reduce my loan balance?\n\nSome loans let you pay only the interest on your loan each month.

This penalty fee could be thousands of dollars.\n\n6 Will I owe a balloon payment?\n\nSome loans require a very large payment at the end of the loan--sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. If interest \nrates go up or if the value of your property drops, you may not be able to refinance your loan before you have to \nmake this large payment.\n\n7 Will I have to document my employment, income, and assets to get this loan?\n\n\n\nSometimes a lender will make a loan without requiring you to show that you are employed and have the income or \nassets to repay the loan.

Congress assigned the Federal Reserve Board (the \n\"Board\") the responsibility of implementing TILA, and the Board currently does so through its Regulation Z.\n\nIn 2004, the Board began the process of reviewing Regulation Z to determine whether revisions were necessary. In \nJanuary 2009, the Board finalized amendments to Regulation Z's rules applicable to open-end (not home secured) \ncredit (e.g., general purpose credit cards, merchant-specific credit plans, and overdraft lines of credit). 1 The Board \nis currently in the process of reviewing disclosures under Regulation Z related to home-secured open-end credit--\nnamely, home equity lines of credit, and closed-end mortgage disclosures. This report is related to the Board's \nreview of disclosures for closed-end mortgage loans. (ICF Macro has prepared a separate report relating to home-\nequity lines of credit). 2 One of the goals of this review is to ensure that the amended regulations lead to improved \ndisclosures that consumers would most likely pay attention to, understand, and be able to use in their decision-\nmaking.\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires that potential borrowers be given three types of disclosures before consummation \nof a closed-end mortgage loan. The first is a Board publication titled \"Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate \nMortgages.\" This publication (referred to in this report as the \"CHARM booklet\") must be provided to potential \nborrowers who inquire about applying for an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) at the time they are provided with an \napplication form or are charged a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. The CHARM booklet provides general \ninformation about how ARMs work, but does not provide any transaction-or program-specific information.\n\n1 As of the writing of this report, the Board is in the process of reviewing these rules in light of legislation passed by Congress in \nMay 2009.\n\n2 Disclosures for reverse mortgages and rescission were not included in this stage of the review of Regulation Z mortgage \ndisclosures.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRegulation Z also requires every creditor to provide an ARM loan program disclosure under the same \ncircumstances and at the same time as the CHARM booklet for each ARM program in which the consumer \nexpresses an interest. The program disclosure gives details about a specific loan program, including the index used \nto determine adjustable rates, how often the index is adjusted, and any caps that apply to increases in the rate. It \nalso includes a table showing a historical example of how rates and payments would have varied over the past 15 \nyears for a hypothetical loan of $ 10,000. Regulation Z currently prescribes no mandatory format for the ARM \nprogram disclosure except that it must be \"clear and conspicuous,\" in writing, and in a form that the consumer may \nkeep.\n\nFinally, Regulation Z requires that consumers applying for a closed-end mortgage loan receive a TILA statement \nthat provides detailed transaction-specific information on the terms of their loan offer. This disclosure is provided to \nprospective borrowers within 3 days of application and typically again before loan closing. 3 Among other things, \nthis disclosure includes the annual percentage rate (APR), finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, and \na payment schedule that shows the number, timing and amounts of payments.In addition to these pre-\nconsummation disclosures, Regulation Z also requires creditors to give borrowers notice after consummation when \nthe interest rate on an ARM changes. Currently, the content of this notice is prescribed, but no mandatory \nformatting is required.\n\nIn December 2007, the Board contracted with ICF Macro, an ICF International company, to assist it with its review \nand revision of closed-end mortgage disclosures. ICF Macro is a research and evaluation company with expertise \nin the design and cognitive testing of effective consumer communication materials. ICF Macro worked with the \nBoard on its review of credit card disclosures and is also currently contributing to its review of TILA regulations \nrelated to home equity lines of credit.\n\nICF Macro's work thus far has consisted of two phases. In the background research phase, ICF Macro conducted \nfour focus groups and six rounds of cognitive interviews, which were primarily focused on gaining knowledge about \nhow consumers use the mortgage disclosures that they now receive, as well as revised disclosures that have been \npreviously proposed. Through the focus groups, which took place in Greenbelt, MD, and Los Angeles, CA, ICF \nMacro gathered information about mortgage shopping, the types of information that consumers currently use for \nfinancial decision-making, and their perceptions of disclosures that are currently in use. Through the in-depth \ncognitive interviews, ICF Macro gathered more detailed information about how participants read disclosures and \ntheir level of comprehension of the content.\n\nThe second phase of the project was devoted to the development and testing of revised forms. This phase \nconsisted of six additional rounds of cognitive interviews in different locations: Atlanta, GA; Bethesda, MD; Dallas, \nTX; Providence, RI; Denver, CO; and Bethesda, MD. For each round, ICF Macro developed a set of model \ndisclosure forms to be tested. Interview participants were asked to review these forms and provide their reactions, \nand were then asked a series of questions designed to test their understanding of the content. Data were collected \non which aspects of each form were most successful in providing information clearly and effectively. The findings \nfrom each round of interviews led to revisions to the models for the next round.\n\nThe findings from the consumer testing informed the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z rules for closed-\nend mortgages, which the Board will publish for public comment in July 2009. The revised disclosure forms that \nwere developed and refined through the testing will be included as model forms and clauses with the proposal.\n\n3 Currently, only applicants for home purchase loans would receive the disclosure within three days of application. Applicants for \nhome equity loans or refinancing would receive the disclosure at closing. Under the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act \namendments to TILA,all applicants must receive the disclosure within three business days of application, effective July 30, 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF METHODOLOGY\n\nResearch participants were recruited by telephone using a structured screening instrument. Almost all participants \nhad obtained a home mortgage in the past 2 years, either for the purposes of a home purchase or for refinancing. In \nlater rounds, several participants were also recruited who were actively shopping for a mortgage but had not yet \nobtained one. The purpose of this was to evaluate the extent to which the forms were clear and informative for \npeople who had not yet gone through the mortgage process.\n\nThe screening instrument included questions to ensure a range of participants in terms of gender, age, and \nethnicity. It also included questions about respondents' current interest rates, as well as whether they had \nexperienced a recent financial hardship or been denied credit or discouraged from applying. These criteria were \nused as proxies to ensure the inclusion of both prime and subprime borrowers as participants in the study. Since \nconsumers' understanding of ARMs was a particular focus for this project, over half of participants had experience \nwith an ARM, either as their current mortgage or a mortgage they had within the previous 5 years.\n\nSUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS\n\nThe following is a summary of key findings from the cognitive testing, as well as the most significant design \ndecisions. Some of the research focused on very specific aspects of the content or format of these forms, but this \nsummary focuses primarily on the broader issues that were addressed during the testing process.\n\nMortgage Shopping Behavior\n\n. Only about half of research participants consulted more than one lender or broker when looking for a mortgage \nloan. The two most common reasons that participants did not shop more actively were a) because they trusted a \nparticular lender or broker due to a personal relationship or prior business relationship; and b) because they were \nreferred to a particular lender (e.g., by a real estate agent or home builder) and did not think to consult others.\n\n. When participants were selecting lenders to contact, trust was one of their most important considerations. Most \nparticipants either began the mortgage shopping process by visiting their current lending institution to look at offers \nor going to a lender or broker recommended by friends, family members, or their realtors.\n\n. Even among participants who shopped for mortgages, the shopping process almost always ended at the point of \nloan application. In some cases this was because of the cost in time and money required to complete another \napplication; other participants who had found the shopping process tiring or frustrating seemed reluctant to revisit \nthe process once they had applied; and a few were concerned that their credit scores would decrease as a result of \nmultiple applications for credit. Whatever the reason, once a loan application was completed and accepted, very \nfew participants ever revisited the shopping process and talked to other lenders--even after they learned that the \nloan they had been offered had terms they did not like, or that the terms of the offer had changed.\n\n. Participants were most likely to select loans based on interest rate, monthly payment, and loan type (i.e., fixed rate \nvs. adjustable rate). Interest rate and monthly payment were by far the two most common terms that focus group \nand interview participants compared between lenders or brokers when shopping. The amount of closing costs and \nthe presence of a prepayment penalty were other terms participants frequently mentioned considering during the \nshopping process.\n\n. When participants were asked what was most difficult about their mortgage experience, the most frequent answer \nwas the amount of paperwork involved. Many commented that because they were shown so many papers at \nclosing they did not read any of them carefully--including their TILA and HUD-1 statements. 4 Some also \n\n4 Under HUD's regulations implementing the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), mortgage borrowers receive a \nGood Faith Estimate (GFE) of settlement costs after submitting a loan application and a HUD-1 statement of settlement costs at \nloan closing.\n\n\n\ncomplained about the amount of information lenders or brokers requested during the loan application process.. \nSome participants felt external pressure to find a loan quickly, which limited their ability to shop. These participants \nincluded those who had found a home they wanted to purchase and had a limited amount of time before closing, \nand those who needed to refinance an ARM before the interest rate adjusted.\n\n. A number of participants indicated that they were informed only at loan closing that the terms of their loan offer \nhad changed. In almost all cases, these participants still completed the loan transaction despite any reservations \nthey had. The most frequent reason mentioned was that they did not feel they had any options at that point in time--\nparticularly in the case of home purchase loans. In other cases, participants accepted loans because they believed, \nor were advised by lenders, that they could easily refinance to better terms in the near future. Finally, several \nparticipants said they felt intimidated and rushed during the closing process and as a result found it difficult to object \nor raise questions.\n\n. While most participants were satisfied with the loans they had received and said they would not have done \nanything differently when shopping for a loan, others said they wished they had spent more time shopping among \nlenders to obtain a better loan. Several had more serious concerns. For example, some had mortgage payments \nthey were struggling to afford. Others had ended up with mortgages that included terms they had originally not \nwanted, such as adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, private mortgage insurance, and points paid at closing, \nwhich increased the costs of their loans.\n\nTILA Statements\n\n. Almost all participants indicated that the interest rate was one of the most important terms they would consider \nwhen evaluating a loan offer. Several were confused by the fact that the interest rate was not included on the \ncurrent TILA statement, or incorrectly assumed that the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) was the interest rate. As a \nresult, the revised TILA statement displays the contract interest rate.\n\n. Participants were generally confused by the fact that their contract loan amount was not displayed on the current \nTILA statement, and many incorrectly assumed that the \"amount financed\" was the amount of money they were \nborrowing. As a result, the loan amount was added into the Loan Summary section of the revised TILA statement.\n\n. Participants consistently indicated they would want an estimate of their settlement charges as early as possible, \nand that it would be helpful to have these charges displayed in the context of their other loan terms (rather than on \na separate document, such as their HUD-1 statement). As a result, settlement charges were added into the Loan \nSummary section of the revised TILA statement.\n\n. Participants indicated that they would find the maximum interest rate and payment--two terms that are not \ndisclosed on the current TILA statement--to be very helpful in assessing the affordability and riskiness of a loan \noffer. As a result, these terms were included in the proposed model forms and clauses.\n\n. Three of the terms disclosed most prominently on the current TILA statement--the number of payments, total of \npayments, and finance charge--were not seen by participants as useful or important to their decision-making. In \naddition, almost all participants were confused by the \"amount financed\" and did not understand what the figure \nsignified. As a result, these four terms are disclosed less prominently on the second page of the revised TILA \nstatement.\n\n. The meaning of the APR was generally not understood by participants. Almost all either assumed that this rate \nwas the same as their interest rate, or understood that the two terms were different but could not explain how. \nParticipants believed a change in the APR would not make much of a difference in their payment. Throughout \nmultiple rounds of testing, ICF Macro designers attempted to clarify the meaning of the APR by using alternative \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nlabels and explanations, but were largely unsuccessful at improving participants' comprehension of the term or \nconcept. The TILA statement being proposed, therefore, focuses on providing context for consumers as to how the \nAPR on their loan compares to others being offered to borrowers with similar loans nationwide. This context is \nbased on the \"Average Prime Offer Rate\" (APOR) for mortgages of a comparable type (fixed or ARM) and maturity. \nThe APOR is calculated weekly and provided on the Federal Financial Institutions Examining Council (FFIEC) \nwebsite and is described on the form as \"the average APR on similar loans offered to borrowers with excellent \ncredit.\" The proposed statement uses both a graphic scale and a narrative description to describe both the APOR \nand a \"high cost zone,\" which begins at 1.5 percentage points above the APOR for first lien loans. 5. Participants \nwere generally confused by the payment schedule shown on the current TILA statement. For example, in \nexamining a TILA statement for a hybrid ARM, several participants incorrectly assumed that the fact that payments \nin the table varied over time meant that they already reflected future changes in interest rates. As a result, the \npayment table was revised to demonstrate more explicitly the relationship between interest rates and payments. \nThe table in the proposed model form and clauses for a hybrid ARM displays these terms at three points in time: the \nintroductory rate and payment, the maximum at first adjustment, and the maximum ever. 6. The revised TILA \nstatement includes a new section labeled \"Key Questions about Risk,\" which provides information about up to nine \npotentially risky or costly features of mortgage loans, such as: adjustable interest rates; potential changes to \npayments; prepayment penalties; interest-only payments; balloon payments; negative amortization; whether the \nproduct is a \"no-documentation\" or \"low-documentation\" loan; whether the loan has a demand feature; and equity \nsharing. For each of these features, the form lists a question (e.g., \"Can my interest rate increase?\") and the \nanswer (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"). 7 All affirmative answers are accompanied by further explanation. This section of the \nform was received very positively by participants, who found the format clear and easy to understand.. In the final \ntwo rounds of testing, ICF Macro tested a TILA statement that described a payment option mortgage. Because the \ndetails of payment option mortgages are so complex, ICF Macro and Board staff focused on developing a \nstatement that would communicate to consumers that a) if they made the minimum payment their loan balance \nwould increase; and b) their minimum payment can increase dramatically in the future. While interview participants \ndid not necessarily understand exactly how payment option ARMs worked based on their review of the form, the \nstatement was largely successful at meeting its two primary communication objectives.\n\n. The proposed TILA model forms and clauses incorporate some of the technical information that is currently \nprovided on ARM loan program disclosures--including information about the frequency of interest rate changes, \ncaps on interest rates, and how the interest rate is calculated. This decision was made in part because the Board \nstaff believes that this information was important for consumers to have when considering a specific loan offer, and \n\n5 For subordinate lien loans, the high cost zone would begin at 3.5 percentage points above the APOR. ICF Macro and Board \nstaff did not construct any tests involving subordinate lien loans.\n\n \n\n \n\n6 The payment tables that are being proposed for loans other than hybrid ARMs (e.g., fixed rate loans or payment option ARMS) \nhave a slightly different structure, reflecting the differences in the payment schedule for these products.\n\n \n\n \n\n7 Three of these features--adjustable interest rates, potential changes to payments, and prepayment penalties--are displayed on \nall TILA statements. The remaining six questions are included only the form only if they apply to the loan being described.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nin part because background research showed that consumers were unlikely to notice or use the information when it \nwas included on the program disclosure.\n\nOther Mortgage Disclosure\n\n. Participants who were shown the CHARM booklet generally indicated that they found the document useful and \nthought the information it contained was important -- particularly for consumers with Tittle experience with \nmortgages. However, a significant number of participants indicated that they would be unlikely to read the booklet \nbecause it was too long. Several participants indicated that they would be more likely to read a shorter and more \nconcise disclosure.\n\n. As a result, ICF Macro developed a new one-page early disclosure titled \"Key Questions to Ask About Your \nMortgage.\" The goal was to summarize the most important information in the CHARM booklet in a shorter, more \nconsumer-friendly format, and to warn consumers of certain risky loan features. This form lists seven questions \nrelated to potentially risky or costly features that prospective borrowers should ask their lenders about any loans \nthey are offered. These questions pertain to interest rate, monthly payment, loan balance reduction, loan balance \nincrease, prepayment penalty, balloon payment, and 'loan documentation. The questions on this disclosure are \nrepeated on the TILA statement along with loan-specific answers to each question, to ensure that borrowers have \ninformation they need to determine whether to get that loan before they are committed. The Key Questions \ndisclosure tested extremely well with participants; all indicated that they would find it useful, and almost all found it \nvery clear and easy-to-read. As a result, the Board is proposing to require that lenders provide the Key Questions \ndocument to prospective borrowers before they submit a loan application.\n\n. Participants who were shown a sample of a current ARM loan program disclosure found the document very \ndifficult to read and understand. They found the narrative format difficult to navigate and the terminology extremely \ncomplicated. A large number misinterpreted the historical example table in the disclosure; for example, some \nthought that the historical rates shown in the table would apply to their loan in the future. As a result, ICF Macro \ndeveloped a simpler revised program disclosure that focuses on four important distinguishing characteristics of an \nARM program: the length of introductory period, the frequency of rate change, the index used to calculate the \ninterest rate, and limits on rate changes. The revised program disclosure does not include a historical example \ntable, but does include product-specific answers that parallel the Key Questions provided at application on the TILA \nstatement.\n\n. Along with the Key Questions document, ICF Macro developed another new early disclosure titled \"Fixed vs. \nAdjustable Rate Mortgages.\" This publication, which the Board is proposing be provided to all prospective \nborrowers, describes the features of ARMs and their relative advantages and disadvantages in relation to fixed-rate \nloan products. Interview participants found the form easy to understand, and indicated that it would be useful to \nthem.\n\n. In addition to those disclosures described above, ICF Macro developed and tested two additional disclosure forms \nand clauses to be provided after loan closing that the Board will propose in July 2009. The first is an ARM \nadjustment notice that would be provided to consumers at least 60 days before terms of their ARM changed and \nwould explicitly describe the change to their interest rate and payment. The second is a disclosure to be included on \nperiodic statements for loans with negative amortization, such as payment option ARMs. This monthly disclosure \nhighlights the consequences that consumers' payment decisions will have on their loan balance. In both cases, \nthese disclosures tested extremely well--participants had little difficulty understanding their content, and indicated \nthat the information would be meaningful and important to them.\n\nCHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\nIn 1968, Congress enacted the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to protect consumers by requiring lenders to provide key \npieces of information to consumers at various points in time. Congress assigned the Federal Reserve Board (the \n\"Board\") the responsibility of implementing TILA, and the Board currently does so through its Regulation Z.\n\nIn 2004, the Board began the process of reviewing Regulation Z to determine whether revisions were necessary. In \nJanuary 2009, the Board finalized amendments to Regulation Z's rules applicable to open-end (not home secured) \ncredit (e.g., general purpose credit cards, merchant-specific credit plans, and overdraft lines of credit). 8 The Board \nis currently in the process of reviewing disclosures under Regulation Z related to home-secured open-end credit--\nnamely, home equity lines of credit and close-end mortgage disclosures. This report is related to the Board's review \nof disclosures for closed-end mortgage loans. 9 One of the goals of this review is to ensure that the amended \nregulations lead to improved disclosures that consumers would most likely pay attention to, understand, and be \nable to use in their decision-making.\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires that potential borrowers be given three types of disclosures before consummation \nof a closed-end mortgage loan. The first is a Board publication titled \"Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate \nMortgages.\" This publication (referred to in this report as the \"CHARM booklet\") must be provided to potential \nborrowers who inquire about applying for an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) at the time they are provided with an \napplication form or are charged a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. The CHARM booklet provides general \ninformation about how ARMs work, but does not provide any transaction-or program-specific information.\n\nRegulation Z also requires every creditor to provide an ARM loan program disclosure under the same \ncircumstances and at the same time as the CHARM booklet, for each ARM program in which the consumer \nexpresses an interest. The program disclosure gives details about a specific loan program, including the index used \nto determine adjustable rates, how often the index is adjusted, and any caps that apply to increases in the rate. It \nalso includes a table showing a historical example of how rates and payments would have varied over the past 15 \nyears for a hypothetical loan of $ 10,000. Regulation Z currently prescribes no mandatory format for the ARM \nprogram disclosure except that it must be \"clear and conspicuous,\" in writing, and in a form that the consumer may \nkeep.\n\nFinally, Regulation Z requires that consumers applying for a closed-end mortgage loan receive a TILA disclosure \nthat provides detailed transaction-specific information on the terms of their loan offer. This disclosure is provided to \nprospective borrowers within 3 days of application and typically again before loan closing. 10 Among other things, \nthis disclosure includes the annual percentage rate (APR), finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, and \na payment schedule that shows the number, timing and amounts of payments.In addition to these pre-\nconsummation disclosures, Regulation Z also requires creditors to give borrowers notice after consummation when \n\n8 As of the writing of this report, the Board is in the process of reviewing these rules in light of legislation passed by Congress in \nMay 2009.\n\n9 Disclosures for reverse mortgages and rescission were not included in this stage of the review of Regulation Z mortgage \ndisclosures.\n\n \n\n \n\n10 Currently, only applicants for home purchase loans would receive the disclosure within three days of application. Applicants for \nhome equity loans or refinancing would receive the disclosure at closing. Under the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act \namendments to TILA,all applicants must receive the disclosure within three business days of application, effective July 30, 2009.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nthe interest rate on an ARM changes. Currently, the content of this notice is prescribed, but no mandatory \nformatting is required.\n\nIn December 2007, the Board contracted with ICF Macro, an ICF International company, to assist it with its review \nand revision of closed-end mortgage disclosures. ICF Macro is a research and evaluation company with expertise \nin the design and cognitive testing of effective consumer communication materials. ICF Macro worked with the \nBoard on its review of credit card disclosures and is currently contributing to its review of TILA regulations related to \nhome equity lines of credit. 11The findings from ICF Macro's work informed the Board's proposed revisions to \nRegulation Z rules for closed-end mortgages, which the Board will publish for public comment in July 2009. The \nrevised disclosure forms that were developed and refined through the testing will be included as model forms with \nthe proposal.\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe project thus far has consisted of two phases. In the background research phase, ICF Macro conducted four \nfocus groups and six rounds of cognitive interviews, which were primarily focused on gaining knowledge about how \nconsumers use the mortgage disclosures that they now receive, as well as revised disclosures that have been \npreviously proposed. Through the focus groups, which took place in Greenbelt, MD, and Los Angeles, CA, ICF \nMacro gathered information about mortgage shopping, the types of information that consumers currently use for \nfinancial decision-making, and their perceptions of disclosures that are currently in use. Through the in-depth \ncognitive interviews, ICF Macro gathered more detailed information about how participants read disclosures and \ntheir level of comprehension of the content.\n\nThe second phase of the project was devoted to the development and testing of revised forms. This phase \nconsisted of six additional rounds of cognitive interviews in different locations: Atlanta, GA; Bethesda, MD; Dallas, \nTX; Providence, RI; Denver, CO; and Bethesda, MD. For each round, ICF Macro developed a set of model \ndisclosure forms to be tested. The model disclosures described loan transactions intended to be generally realistic \nfor participants. The terms of the transactions were often constructed to facilitate testing of specific form elements \nand did not necessarily reflect actual market terms and conditions. Interview participants were asked to review \nthese forms and provide their reactions, and were then asked a series of questions designed to test their \nunderstanding of the content. Data were collected on which aspects of each form were most successful in providing \ninformation clearly and effectively. The findings from each round of interviews led to revisions to the models for the \nnext round.\n\nAppendix A provides an overview of the rounds of focus groups and cognitive interviews that have been conducted \nas part of this project, as well as the topics addressed in each round.\n\nRECRUITMENT OF RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS\n\nInterview and focus group participants were recruited by telephone using a structured screening instrument \ndeveloped by ICF Macro and Board staff. Participation was limited to people who were the primary mortgage \ndecision-maker in their households, and who did not work for a bank or other financial institution or in the real estate \nor mortgage industry. Other questions ensured the recruitment of participants with a range of ethnicities, ages, \neducation levels, and mortgage behavior. Nearly all participants had obtained a mortgage (either for a home \npurchase or through refinancing) in the past 2 years. Since consumers' understanding of ARMs was a particular \n\n11 ICF Macro has submitted a separate report to the Board describing its findings related to home equity lines of credit, which will \nalso be published with its proposed rules.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nfocus for this project, over half of participants had experience with an ARM, either as their current mortgage or a \nmortgage they had within the previous 5 years.\n\nIn each of the last four rounds at least one participant was recruited who was actively shopping for a mortgage but \nhad not yet obtained one. The purpose of this was to evaluate the extent to which the forms were clear and \ninformative for people who had not yet gone through the mortgage process.\n\nThe recruiting screener used for interviews conducted in Providence, RI is provided as Appendix B; while the \nscreener for other rounds varied slightly, the intent of the screening questions was essentially the same. Information \nabout the demographic and background characteristics of the interview participants is provided as Appendix C.\n\nOne of the recruiting goals was to ensure that interviews were conducted with both prime and subprime borrowers. \nBecause many consumers do not know their credit scores or are reluctant to share them, it was determined that a \ncredit score could not be used as a screening variable for the purposes of recruiting. Therefore, participants were \ndefined as \"subprime\" if they had: a) suffered a \"financial hardship\" such as bankruptcy, foreclosure, repossession \nor a tax lien in the past 7 years; b) been denied credit or discouraged from applying for credit in the past 2 years; or \nc) received an interest rate higher than 8 percent on their most recent first mortgage (or 10 percent on their most \nrecent second mortgage). These cutoff points on the interest rate screening questions for borrowers with subprime \nloans were set to be roughly consistent with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) APR-based thresholds for \nreporting higher-priced loans over the 2006-2007 period. 12 Fifty-nine of the 134 research participants qualified as \n\"subprime\" using the three criteria related to creditworthiness.STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT\n\nThis report provides a summary of the work that has been carried out to date, the methodologies used, and the \nfindings that influenced the development of the proposed model forms and clauses that will be released for public \ncomment.\n\nChapters II and III describe the background research ICF Macro conducted with consumers prior to developing any \nnew forms. Chapter II details ICF Macro's findings about how consumers currently shop for mortgages, while \nChapter III presents research into the usability of several types of mortgage disclosures that are either currently \nprovided to consumers or have been previously proposed.\n\nChapters IV through VII describe the second phase of the project, during which new disclosure forms were \ndeveloped and tested. Chapter IV highlights the general design principles that ICF Macro form designers used \nduring the course of the form development. Chapter V details the development and testing of revised TILA \nstatements through six rounds of cognitive interviews, while Chapter VI describes the development and testing of \nseveral other types of disclosures related to mortgages that are provided at application or after closing. Finally, \nChapter VII provides a brief summary of the project outcomes.\n\nCHAPTER II: FINDINGS ABOUT MORTGAGE SHOPPING\n\nOne of the goals of ICF Macro's consumer research has been to obtain a better understanding of the extent to \nwhich consumers shop for mortgages (i.e., compare quotes from more than one lender or broker) and what kind of \ninformation they consider when doing so. Since one of the purposes of the Board's disclosures is to make \n\n12 \n\nIn January 2009, the cutoff points for this screening question were adjusted to 7.5 percent for first mortgages and 9.5 percent for \nsecond mortgages, to reflect the lower HMDA APR-based reporting thresholds over the 2007-08 period.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nconsumers more effective shoppers for mortgages, it is important that the development of these documents is \ninformed both by how consumers shop currently and by the obstacles that they encounter in trying to do so.\n\nAll rounds of focus groups and interviews conducted by ICF Macro included an introductory segment during which \nparticipants discussed their recent experiences shopping for mortgages. Participants were asked to describe how \nthey had previously shopped for mortgages, including how many lenders or brokers they spoke to, how they \nidentified potential lenders or brokers, and the factors they considered when choosing a mortgage. The following is \na summary of ICF Macro's key findings about mortgage shopping.\n\nSHOPPING FOR A MORTGAGE\n\n. Only about half of research participants consulted more than one lender or broker when looking for a \nmortgage loan. The two most common reasons that participants did not shop more actively were a) because they \ntrusted a particular lender or broker due to a personal relationship or prior business relationship; and b) because \nthey were referred to a particular lender (e.g., by a real estate agent or home builder) and did not think to consult \nothers. Other reasons participants cited for not shopping included time constraints, a reluctance to have multiple \nlenders perform a credit check because of the impact it would have on their credit scores, concern about the \namount of effort it would take to complete paperwork for multiple lenders, and in a few cases, a mistaken belief that \nall lenders would offer the same rates and terms.\n\n. When participants were selecting lenders to contact, trust was one of their most important considerations. \nMost participants either began the mortgage shopping process by visiting their current lending institution to look at \noffers or going to a lender or broker recommended by friends, family members, or their realtors. Others selected a \nlender based on its general reputation as a financial institution. Several participants used the internet to compare \nloan products, using web resources that gave them multiple quotes from different lenders. A few contacted lenders \nto inquire about offers they saw in newspaper, radio, or television advertisements.\n\n. Participants who actively shopped for mortgages used a variety of methods to compare loans. Some \nreported using internet tools to compare offers from different lenders. Others relied on offers that they received from \ndifferent lenders over the phone. A few met in person with representatives from different banks. In general, these \nparticipants were more certain about what type of loan they wanted and what terms were most important to them.\n\n. Participants with poor credit were more likely to indicate they had difficulty finding financing. Some \nparticipants indicated that because of poor credit or recent financial hardships, it was difficult for them to find a \nlender who would offer them a mortgage. These participants often indicated that in order to get a loan, they had to \naccept terms they felt were less than ideal, such as an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) or a mortgage with a pre-\npayment penalty.\n\n. Even among participants who shopped for mortgages, the shopping process almost always ended at the \npoint of loan application. Even participants who actively shopped for their mortgage and solicited information from \nseveral lenders usually only applied for one loan. In some cases this was because of the cost in time and money \nrequired to complete another application; other participants who had found the shopping process tiring or frustrating \nseemed reluctant to revisit the process once they had applied. Whatever the reason, once a loan application was \ncompleted and accepted, very few participants ever revisited the shopping process and talked to other lenders--\neven after they learned that the loan they had applied for had terms they did not like, or when the terms of the offer \nchanged.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSUMERS WHEN SHOPPING\n\n. Participants were most likely to shop based on interest rate, monthly payment, and loan type. Interest rate \nand monthly payment were by far the two most common terms that focus group and interview participants \ncompared between lenders or brokers when shopping. Most participants said they were primarily interested in fixed \nrate mortgages. While some indicated that they would consider an ARM if they were sure they could refinance or \nsell before the rate adjusted, others said they would never apply for an ARM. 13 Other terms some participants \nconsidered when shopping were closing costs, prepayment penalties, discount points, whether private mortgage \ninsurance was required, and balloon payments.\n\nEDUCATION ABOUT MORTGAGE PROCESS\n\n. Participants who educated themselves about the mortgage process primarily did so through an informal \nnetworking process with family, friends, and colleagues. New homebuyers were more likely to have gathered \ninformation about the mortgage process before starting their search; in most cases participants who were getting \ntheir second or third mortgage felt that they were already knowledgeable and did not seek out additional \ninformation.\n\n. Some participants indicated that prior to getting their first mortgage they sought out information about the \nprocess on the Internet. Fewer participants said they obtained information about the mortgage shopping process \nby reading magazines or newspapers or by attending workshops. A few also indicated they educated themselves \nby reviewing materials provided by their lending institution. Subprime participants were less likely to use the Internet \nand more likely to rely on information from family or friends.\n\nFRUSTRATIONS AND SURPRISES\n\n. Most participants felt overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork involved in obtaining a loan. When \nparticipants were asked what was most difficult about their mortgage experience, the most frequent answer was the \namount of paperwork involved. Many commented that because they were asked to sign so many papers at closing \nthey did not read any of them carefully--including their TILA and HUD-1 statements. Some also complained about \nthe amount of information lenders or brokers requested during the loan application process. A few participants said \nthey felt uncomfortable providing detailed financial information to a large number of lenders or brokers because of \nconcerns about privacy. While none explicitly said so, this may have been an additional reason that some \nparticipants did not shop for mortgages more widely.\n\n. Time pressure was a particular concern among borrowers who were purchasing a home and those who \nfelt a need to refinance before their mortgage rates adjusted. Once participants found a home they wanted to \npurchase, many felt pressured to find a loan quickly, which limited their ability to shop. As one participant explained, \n\"I found a house that I really loved in this neighborhood that I've been living in...Then a week later it was my \n\n13 \n\nIt is important to note that much of the consumer research described in this report took place during the \"mortgage crisis\" of \n2008-09. As a result, participants may have been more risk-averse and suspicious of ARMs and other alternative mortgage \nproducts than they would have been in previous years.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nhome...I didn't even know how to get a mortgage or anything so it all just happened really quickly.\" Some \nparticipants said they felt pressure because they had an ARM and needed to re-finance before the interest rate \nadjusted. As a result, they did not talk to as many potential lenders as they might have otherwise.\n\n. Participants had difficulty acting on information they were provided for the first time at loan closing. \nSeveral participants indicated they were surprised by important changes in their loan terms at the loan closing. In a \nfew cases, for example, participants said that they had originally been offered a fixed-rate loan, but were told at \nclosing their rate would be adjustable. In almost all of these cases, participants still completed the loan transaction \ndespite their reservations. The most frequent reason mentioned was that they did not feel they had any options at \nthat point in time--particularly in the case of home purchase loans. In other cases, participants accepted loans \nbecause they believed or were advised by lenders, that they could easily refinance to better terms in the near \nfuture. Finally, several participants said they felt intimidated and rushed during the closing process and as a result \nfound it difficult to object or raise questions.\n\n. Some participants did not believe they were given enough information during the mortgage process. For \nexample, one participant complained their broker did not show him all of the loan offers for which he was qualified. \nOther participants felt their lender or broker should have explained the terms of their loan more clearly--for example, \nhow and when rates and payments were going to vary. These complaints were more common among participants \nwho were purchasing their first home; participants who had previous mortgage experience were much less likely to \ncomplain about a lack of information.\n\n. Although most participants were satisfied with their loans, some had serious concerns about their \nmortgages. Most participants were satisfied with the loans they had received and said they would not have done \nanything differently when shopping for a loan. However, some said that, in retrospect, they wished they had spent \nmore time shopping among lenders to obtain a better loan. Several had more serious concerns. For example, some \nhad mortgages they were struggling to pay. Others had ended up with mortgages that included terms they had \noriginally not wanted, such as adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, private mortgage insurance, and points paid \nat closing.\n\nCHAPTER III: TESTING OF CURRENT AND PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED DISCLOSURE FORMS\n\nAs noted earlier in this report, the first phase of ICF Macro's consumer testing primarily focused on gaining \nknowledge about how consumers used the mortgage disclosures they now receive as well as testing selected \ndisclosures that were previously proposed by other organizations. In this early phase of testing, ICF Macro tested \nthree types of disclosures:\n\n. Transaction-Specific Disclosures: These disclosures provide information about a specific loan offer from a \nlender. The transaction-specific disclosure that is currently required is known as the \"TILA statement.\" It is currently \nprovided to consumers at two points in the mortgage process--an initial version is provided within 3 days of \napplication and a final document is generally provided before loan closing.\n\n. ARM Loan Program Disclosures: This disclosure is required when a consumer who has expressed interest in an \nARM received an application form. The form provides information about ARM loan programs offered by the lender \nbut not about specific loan terms based on the consumer's creditworthiness.\n\n. The Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages (the \"CHARM booklet\"): Like the program \ndisclosure, the CHARM booklet is required to be provided to consumers who have expressed interest in an ARM \nwhen they receive an application form. This booklet provides general information about ARMs and how they work \nas well as potential risks of getting an ARM.\n\n\n\nThe following chapter of the report describes ICF Macro's consumer research findings related to these disclosures. \nIt also includes the implications these findings had for subsequent disclosure design efforts.\n\nTRANSACTION-SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES\n\nIn addition to the TILA statement format that is currently in use, two other formats were tested during the \nbackground research phase of the project (Phase I). These included:\n\n. A form proposed in 1998 by staff from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Board \n(referred to in this report as the \"joint form\"); 14 and\n\n. A three-page form proposed by Alex Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute in 2007. This form, titled \"The \nBasic Facts About Your Mortgage Loan,\" is referred to in this report as the \"Pollock form.\" It contains one page of \ntransaction-specific information and a two-page glossary.\n\nICF Macro and Board staff opted to study these two specific forms for several reasons. The joint form shared a \nnumber of common elements with the current TILA and thus supplemented benchmark testing of the TILA \nstatement. In addition, this form reflected joint efforts by HUD and Board staff to combine informational elements \nfrom the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and TILA into a single disclosure. The Pollock form, on \nthe other hand, utilized a significantly different format than the existing TILA and joint forms. This form also \nspecifically addressed features of ARMs, which was a primary area of focus for this study. 15Usability information \non the current TILA statement was collected through focus groups in Greenbelt, MD and Los Angeles, CA (Rounds \n1 and 4), as well as through cognitive interviews in Baltimore, MD (Round 7). The Pollock and joint forms were \ntested through interviews in Washington, DC and Los Angeles, CA (Rounds 2 and 3). The forms that were shown \nto consumers during this background research phase are provided in Appendix D.\n\n14 \n\nUnder a 1996 Congressional directive, the Board and HUD studied ways to simplify and improve the disclosures required by \nTILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). In July 1998, the Board and HUD submitted a Joint Report to the \nCongress that provided a broad outline intended to be a starting point for consideration of legislative reform of the mortgage \ndisclosure requirements. The report included a proposed two-page disclosure that would largely include the information required \nby both laws. Information elements related to TILA were included on the first page; the second page included a breakout of \nsettlement costs to fulfill the requirements of RESPA. The first page of this combined form was used in the background research \nphase of this project. The 1998 report the agencies submitted to Congress is available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/tila.pdf.\n\n \n\n15 \n\nThis project focused primarily on disclosures related to ARMs and other more complex mortgage products. In 2007, the Federal \nTrade Commission (FTC) conducted research on consumer understanding of TILA and other disclosures in the context of fixed-\nrate mortgages.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSummary of Findings\n\nInitial Reactions to the TILA Statement\n\n. Only a few participants from the background research testing recognized the current TILA statement, or knew that \nthey had received this document previously. Those that did recognize the form usually commented on the four \nboxes at the top of the page containing the Annual Percentage Rate, Finance Charge, Amount Financed, and Total \nof Payments.\n\n. Participants who did recognize the TILA statement were asked whether they had found the document useful when \nthey received it previously. Most indicated that they had not, either because they had not understood it or because \nthey had not paid attention to it at loan closing.\n\nLoan Summary Information\n\nAmount Financed/Loan Amount\n\n. Most participants who reviewed the current TILA statement incorrectly assumed the \"amount financed\" was the \nsame as the loan amount or, as one participant said, \"the cost of the house.\"\n\n. The Pollock and joint forms listed the loan amount, rather than the amount financed. All but one participant who \nreviewed these forms were able to correctly identify the loan amount.\n\nTotal of Payments\n\n. When reviewing the current TILA, most participants assumed the \"total of payments\" was equal to the sum of the \nfinance charge and the amount financed.\n\nLoan Term\n\n. The current TILA and joint forms did not display the loan term. Most participants who were asked to identify the \nloan term added up the number of payments shown in the payment schedule to calculate their answer. However, a \nfew found it difficult to do so and as a result could not answer this question.\n\n. All but one of the participants who were shown the Pollock statement were able to correctly identify the loan term \n(30 years).\n\nSettlement Costs\n\n. When asked whether there was any information that did not appear on the current TILA statement that they \nthought should be displayed, several participants commented it would be helpful to see more detailed information \nabout closing costs and/or settlement charges.\n\n. All participants correctly identified the amount of the closing costs on both the Pollock and the joint forms. About \nhalf of the participants indicated they would want the closing costs to be itemized on the statement.\n\nAPR and Finance Charge\n\n\n\n. Most participants who reviewed the current TILA and joint forms indicated the \"finance charge\" was the cost one \nwould pay for getting the loan. It was unclear whether these participants understood that this figure was made up of \nboth interest and fees.\n\n. Almost all participants who were shown the current TILA statement or joint form did not understand what was \nmeant by the APR. 16 Many assumed it was synonymous with the interest rate while others understood that the two \nterms were different they were unable to articulate how they differed.. Some participants who saw the joint form \n(which provided an explanation of the APR) understood that this rate included both interest and fees. However, \nmost of these participants only realized this after looking at the form for several minutes and even then did not \nunderstand how the term might be useful to them.\n\n. Participants had various misinterpretations of the APR, such as that it reflected how the rate would adjust in the \nfuture, or that it was the maximum possible rate. These misinterpretations occurred even when participants were \nlooking at the joint form, which included an explanation of the term.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\nUnderstanding of Adjustable Rate\n\n. Over half of the participants who reviewed the current TILA statement understood the interest rate on the loan \nwould change. However, several arrived at this conclusion because the payment schedule showed different \nmonthly payments (which would not necessarily indicate that the loan had an adjustable rate) and not because the \nform was marked as having a \"variable rate feature.\" A few participants indicated they did not know whether the \nrate would change or not.\n\n. Some participants who saw the current TILA commented that although the form used the term \"variable rate,\" they \nwere more familiar with the term \"adjustable rate.\" In fact, a few did not realize that the fact that the \"variable rate\" \nbox on the form was checked meant the rate could change.\n\n. All participants who reviewed the joint form understood the loan had an adjustable rate. However, less than half \nunderstood the interest rate was fixed for the first 3 years. The remainder thought that the rate could vary within the \nfirst 3 years; several, in fact, thought that it could begin varying after only 1 month. Several others indicated the form \ndid not provide any information about when the interest rate could adjust. Moreover, most participants did not know \nhow often the interest rate could adjust; only a small number correctly indicated the interest rate could adjust \nannually after the first 3 years.\n\n. Almost all participants who saw the joint and Pollock forms were able to identify the initial interest rate and most \nwere able to also identify the maximum interest rate.\n\n. All but one participant who reviewed the Pollock form realized the loan had an adjustable rate. Most understood \nthe rate was fixed for 3 years and would begin to vary after that. However, only about half of participants were able \nto indicate the rate would change annually after the first 3 years. Moreover, a few participants incorrectly indicated \nthat after 3 years, the rate would change to the maximum possible rate.\n\n16 \n\nThe APR did not appear on the Pollock form.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. When participants in several rounds of testing were queried as to what would cause their interest rate to go up or \ndown, they gave a variety of responses, including \"the market\"; \"the economy\"; the \"prime rate\"; the \"Fed rate\"; and \nthe Consumer Price Index. All of these responses seemed to reflect a common belief that rates would change \nbased on external market forces over which they had no control. However, most participants did not understand the \ndetails of how this rate would be determined (i.e., that it would remain at a fixed margin above a given index rate).\n\nMonthly Payments\n\n. Several participants commented they liked the payment schedule shown on the current TILA and joint forms \nbecause it provided specific and detailed information about their future payments. However, most incorrectly \nassumed the monthly payments shown in the payment schedule were their future monthly payments, rather than \nestimates that could change based on the market. One participant explained, \"I like the [the joint] form because it \nshows...the payment could change, but it shouldn't be dramatically different.\" This misconception led to some \nconfusion among participants who questioned how the form could display their future monthly payments when the \ninterest rate was adjustable.\n\n. The joint and Pollock forms each disclosed the maximum rate and payment that could ever be charged on the \nloan, while the current TILA statement did not. Participants strongly supported the inclusion of this information on \nthe form, because they felt it would help them make more informed decisions regarding the affordability and \nriskiness of adjustable rate mortgages.\n\n. Almost all participants who saw the joint form were able to correctly identify the initial monthly payment and knew \nthis payment could vary over time. However, as with interest rates, participants were confused as to when the \npayment could begin adjusting. While some participants correctly stated the payments could change after 3 years, \nothers thought the payments could adjust as early as within 1 month.\n\n. Almost all participants who reviewed the Pollock form correctly identified the initial monthly payment on the Pollock \nform. When looking at the Pollock form, most participants understood the monthly payments would be fixed for the \nfirst 3 years of the loan and then could vary.\n\n. When asked if the Pollock form indicated what the payment would become after 3 years, about half of the \nparticipants identified the payment associated with the fully-indexed rate. However, it appeared that some \nparticipants correctly identified the fully-indexed rate because it was the only other payment displayed on the form, \nrather than because they understood the term. When asked to explain the meaning of \"fully-indexed rate,\" most \nparticipants were unable to do so (see the section \"Terms Unique to Pollock Form\" below).\n\nTaxes and Insurance (Escrow)\n\n. Most participants who saw the joint form incorrectly assumed that the payments shown in the payment schedule \nincluded escrow, even though there was a footnote stating otherwise. Some participants later saw the footnote and \nrealized their mistake while others did not.\n\n. The word \"escrow\" has different meanings in different parts of the country which led to confusion on the part of \nparticipants who reviewed the joint form. Most participants in Washington, DC. understood the term referred to \nadditional funds for taxes and insurance that are added to the monthly payment. In California, however, the word \n\"escrow\" is used to refer to the process of closing on a loan.\n\n. Some participants suggested the joint form provide an explanation of the word \"escrow,\" since they thought not \neveryone would be familiar with the term. Others suggested either adding another column in the payment schedule \nto include escrow or moving the information about escrow closer to the payment schedule.\n\n. When asked which of the monthly payments shown on the Pollock form would be their initial monthly payment, \nmost selected the payment that included taxes and insurance, while a few participants chose the payment with just \n\n\n\nprincipal and interest. 17 Participants who assumed that payments would not include escrow tended to be those \nwho were younger and had less experience with mortgages.Other Required Disclosure Text\n\nPrepayment Penalty\n\n. While most participants reviewing the current TILA understood the general meaning of the phrase \"prepayment \npenalty,\" about half thought the penalty would not apply if they sold the house or refinanced their loan. A few were \nconfused by the language that indicated they would \"not be entitled to a refund of part of their finance charge\"; \nthese participants thought if they paid off the loan they would still be responsible for paying the full finance charge \nshown on the top of the page.\n\n. When looking at the joint form, almost all participants realized there was a prepayment penalty associated with the \nloan. However, some incorrectly assumed this penalty would only apply if the loan was paid off or if the house was \nsold, not if the loan was refinanced. A number of participants also commented that they would like the form to \nprovide the amount of the penalty as well as the specific circumstances in which it would apply.\n\n. When reviewing the Pollock form, almost all participants understood that a prepayment penalty would be charged \nand they were able to correctly identify the amount of that penalty.\n\n. The version of the Pollock form used for testing in Washington, DC stated the prepayment penalty would be \ncharged \"if you refinance within the first three years.\" Several participants who saw this version of the form did not \nrealize that the penalty would also apply if they sold the house or otherwise paid off the loan. A version of the \nPollock form used in Los Angeles was revised to read that the fee must be paid \"if you pay off or refinance your \nloan.\" This led to fewer misconceptions among participants, although one participant still questioned whether he \nwould have to pay a penalty if he sold the house.\n\nOther Loan Terms\n\n. Very few of the participants who saw the current TILA understood the terms \"security interest\" and \"demand \nfeature.\" About half of the participants who read the description of loan assumption understood what it meant; \nothers were confused by this text. Several participants were surprised to learn that mortgages could be transferred \nin this way.\n\n. Participants generally indicated that the information on the bottom half of the current TILA statement and joint form \n(e.g., information about security interest, late charges, loan assumption, demand feature, and hazard insurance) \nwas much less important than that on the top half of the form (e.g., information about interest rates and payment). \nAt least half did not understand what was meant by \"security interest,\" \"assumption,\" or \"demand feature.\"\n\n. The two pieces of information on the bottom half of the current TILA statement that participants did indicate were \nimportant to them were whether or not the interest rate could change, and whether the loan included a pre-payment \npenalty.\n\nTerms Unique to Pollock Form\n\nThe Pollock form had several terms and features not found on the current TILA or joint forms. The findings specific \nto Pollock terminology and features are described below.\n\n17 The Pollock form did not indicate whether or not escrow was required, so none of these responses were correct or incorrect.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nType of Loan\n\n. The Pollock form used in testing listed the \"type of loan\" as a \"3/1 LIBOR ARM.\" Almost all participants were \nconfused by this term and did not understand what was meant by either \"3/1\" or \"LIBOR.\" 18 Only one participant \nunderstood that \"LIBOR\" referred to the index being used to determine the interest rate; another understood this \nafter seeing a reference to LIBOR in the glossary.Fully-Indexed Rate\n\n. Most participants did not understand that the fully-indexed rate was the level to which the interest rate would \neventually adjust assuming there was no market fluctuation (i.e., no variation in the LIBOR index). Several simply \nthought this was what the interest rate would change to in 3 years, rather than an estimate. Other participants had \neven more serious misconceptions; for example, one thought the fully-indexed rate represented the fee that the \nmortgage broker would receive for his or her services.\n\nPayment-to-Income (PTI) Ratio\n\n. All participants correctly interpreted the payment-to-income ratio shown on the Pollock form as the percentage of \ntheir income that would be required to make their loan payments.\n\n. Participants' reactions to the inclusion of the PTI ratio on the form were mixed. Some thought this information \nwould be useful to help them budget for their mortgage payments. Others, however, felt this ratio was not helpful \nbecause it did not account for other debts and bills. One participant commented that the PTI ratio was not a \nvaluable measure because it might change dramatically in the event of a career change.\n\n. Participants interpreted the income figure provided on the Pollock form differently; about half assumed the figures \nlisted would be pre-tax, while the other half thought they would be post-tax. Because of this confusion, several \nparticipants suggested this be clarified on the form. 19. When asked whether they would rather be shown pre- or \npost-tax income on this form, participants were again split. Some preferred to see post-tax income, since they felt \nthis would make the ratio more useful. Others preferred to see pre-tax income, because that is the figure with which \nthey are more familiar. The majority of participants also indicated it would be more useful to have monthly income \nlisted on the form, as opposed to annual income.\n\n. Participants had very different opinions of how high the PTI ratio would have to be before they would feel \nuncomfortable taking the loan. When asked what level would make them uncomfortable, participants gave \nresponses ranging from 20 to 50 percent. Only one participant looked in the glossary and found the reference to the \n\"industry standard\" of 28 percent.\n\nGlossary\n\n. Very few participants noticed the glossary when first reading the form and even fewer referred to the glossary \nwhen they came across terms they did not understand.\n\n18 \"LIBOR\" stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is used as an index for determining the rate on some ARM \nloans.\n\n \n\n \n\n19 The Pollock form does not indicate whether the income shown is pre- or post-tax.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. When asked by the interviewer to review the glossary, participants were very positive toward it; they found it to be \nuser-friendly and easy to understand.\n\n. Participants suggested that more consumers would use the glossary if it appeared before the form, rather than \nafter it.\n\nDesign cations\n\n. There were several items that do not appear on the current TILA that participants consistently indicated they would \nwant to see on a revised form. In some cases, these were terms that participants already use when shopping for a \nmortgage, and therefore including this information on the TILA statement would allow them to confirm that they \nreceived what they had been offered verbally. In other cases participants felt the information would be helpful for \nthem to make informed decisions between loans. Therefore, all revised TILA forms developed for this project \nincluded following new terms: the loan amount, loan term, interest rate, settlement charges, and maximum rate and \npayment.\n\n. Testing of the current TILA and joint forms showed that few participants understood the APR; many assumed it \nwas the same as the loan interest rate, while those who knew that it differed from the interest rate were unsure why. \nIn its subsequent revisions of the TILA statement, ICF Macro attempted to clarify the meaning of the APR by \nvarying the labels and explanations used, changing the prominence and placement of the term, and in later rounds, \nincluding a graphic showing how the APR compares to that of similar loan offers to provide context.\n\n. Testing clearly showed that the current TILA payment schedule is ineffective at communicating to consumers \nwhat could happen to their payments. One goal of the revised TILA was to portray more clearly what could happen \nto payments over time--while making it clear to consumers that in the case of an ARM, their actual payment could \nnot be accurately predicted.\n\n. Because participants indicated they were more familiar with the phrase \"adjustable rate\" rather than \"variable rate\" \nas it related to mortgages, and because a few did not realize that the fact that a loan had a \"variable rate\" meant \nthat the interest rate could change, the phrase \"adjustable rate\" was used on all revised TILA forms.\n\n. Because participants who saw the joint and Pollock forms were unsure whether escrow would be included in their \nmonthly payments, the portion of the payment that went toward escrow was disclosed prominently in the payment \ntable on the revised TILA forms.\n\n. Because participants generally indicated that the bottom half of the TILA statement was significantly less useful to \nthem, ICF Macro reformatted this section of the form significantly. The presence of an adjustable rate or \nprepayment penalty, both of which participants indicated were important, were disclosed prominently on all revised \nTILA forms. However, other information that was considered less important (such as the need for hazard insurance \nor the amount of a late payment fee), or that was confusing to consumers (such as information about loan \nassumption, a demand feature, or security interest) was reworded and removed from the TILA statement.\n\nARM LOAN PROGRAM DISCLOSURE\n\nICF Macro tested an ARM loan program disclosure form through the two rounds of focus groups held in Greenbelt, \nMD and Los Angeles, CA (Rounds 1 and 4). This form, which is provided in Appendix D, was designed to be \nrepresentative of forms that are currently in use. The following is a summary of findings related to this initial \nprogram disclosure.\n\nSummary of Findings\n\n. None of the participants, including those who had recently shopped for an ARM, remembered ever receiving \nanything similar to the ARM loan program disclosure they were shown.\n\n\n\n. Participants overwhelmingly indicated they would not find the program disclosure useful and that if given the form, \nthey probably would not read it.\n\n. Upon looking at the form, the first reaction of many participants was one of confusion. Several complained it was \nvery difficult to read due to the terminology that was used. One commented, \"You've got to be a financial expert to \nunderstand that That's ridiculous. That's like the fine print on the credit card.\" Another said that in order to \nunderstand the disclosure \"you'd have to take a semester [course] in this.\"\n\n. Several focus group participants were concerned they could not find any information about what their actual \ninterest rate would be They indicated that in the absence of this rate, most of the other information provided was not \nimportant to them.\n\n. The second page of the disclosure included a chart showing a historical example of how payments would have \nvaried for a $ 10,000 loan over the previous 15 years. Several participants did not realize this was only an historical \nexample and assumed that the numbers related to a loan they were actually being offered. Some participants who \ndid understand the purpose of the chart commented that because the size of the loan was so low the information \nwas not helpful. Others assumed that because the chart showed 15 years, it was showing a loan with a 15-year \namortization period (in fact, the chart was for a 30-year loan).\n\n. Several participants commented that the ARM loan program disclosure should show the best and worst case \nscenarios with regard to the interest rate and payment adjustments over the life of the loan. Other changes \nsuggested by at least one participant included simplifying the terminology used on the form; enlarging the font size \nused in the disclosure; replacing the historical table with a line graph; and bolding or highlighting key terms from the \nfirst page for emphasis.\n\nDesign Implications\n\n. Because participant reactions to the current program disclosure were so negative, this disclosure was redesigned \nand tested again with consumers in Providence, RI (Round 11). The goal of this redesign was to use plainer \nlanguage to simplify the form and to focus the disclosure more specifically on potentially risky features of ARMs. \nResearch findings related to the revised program disclosure are provided in Chapter VI of this report.\n\n. Based on the results of the focus groups, ICF Macro and Board staff felt that borrowers would be much more likely \nto pay attention to and use information that is provided in the context of an actual offer. Therefore, some specific \ninformation about how interest rates would adjust, such as the index and margin used to determine the rate and \ncaps on rate change, were included in the revised TILA.\n\nCHARM BOOKLET\n\nICF Macro collected usability information about the CHARM booklet 20 through the two rounds of focus groups held \nin Greenbelt, MD and Los Angeles, CA (Rounds 1 and 4). This booklet was also shown to interview participants in \nWashington, DC and Kansas City, KS (Rounds 2 and 6). The following is a summary of findings related to this \ndisclosure.Summary of Findings\n\nConsumer Familiarity with CHARM Booklet\n\n20 A PDF version of the CHARM booklet may be found at www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/arms/armsbrochure.pdf. A web summary \nis also available at www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/arms/arms_english.htm\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. Almost none of the participants had seen the CHARM booklet before testing. Even among participants who had \nrecently obtained an ARM, very few indicated they had been given the booklet. A few thought they might have seen \nthe booklet when they were shopping for loans, but did not have a clear memory of its contents or whether they had \nfound the resource useful. Therefore, the majority of the reactions described in this report are based on participants' \nbrief review of the booklet during testing.\n\nInitial Reactions to the CHARM Booklet\n\n. The majority of participants liked the information contained in the CHARM booklet because it was informative and \neducational. Several participants commented the booklet answered questions that some consumers might be \nreluctant to ask; as one said, \"People don't like to ask questions, so this is good.\"\n\n. Several participants noted that despite their risks, ARMs can be a useful tool for some consumers who need a low \nintroductory rate or who plan to sell or refinance their loan before the interest rate adjusts. These participants felt \nthe booklet would be particularly beneficial to this type of consumer because it would help them successfully \nimplement their plan.\n\n. There were specific aspects of the booklet that participants particularly liked:\n. One of the most frequently mentioned sections of interest to participants was the description of payment \nshock on page 20. A few participants thought the section was so important that it should have been moved to \nthe front of the booklet. One participant was concerned that people would not read the section in its current \nlocation because it is \"buried in the middle--you get bored after the 5th page, [and] you don't get that far.\" A few \nparticipants also liked the graph that gave an example of payment shock because it visually showed how \nmuch your payment could increase.\n\n. The cautionary bullets on the first page were cited as being particularly useful by several participants. They \nthought it was a good idea to mention the most important topics early in the booklet. Some participants also \ncommented it was helpful that the bulleted items included page numbers so readers could easily find more \ninformation on the subject.\n\n. A large number of participants also identified the sections about prepayment penalties and negative \namortization, the Mortgage Shopping Worksheet, and the glossary as being particularly important.\n\n. Fewer participants found other parts of the booklet important. Those parts cited included the definitions of \n\"lenders\" and \"brokers\" on page 5, the description of payment caps on page 13, and the explanation of different \ntypes of ARMs beginning on page 15.Length of the CHARM Booklet\n\n. Although all participants thought the booklet contained useful information and would be beneficial to consumers \nwho are considering ARMs, most thought the booklet was too long. Many participants said they would be more \nlikely to read the booklet if it was shorter. A smaller number of participants disagreed and indicated that if the \nbooklet were shortened it would actually be less useful because it would not include as much important information. \nThere were even a few participants who thought the booklet was too short and should include more detail--for \nexample, information about other loan products other than ARMs.\n\n. Several participants suggested that multiple versions of the booklet could be developed--a shorter version, for \npeople who were unlikely to read a longer document, and a longer version for those who wanted more detailed \ninformation. They felt this might be the best way to make sure everyone saw at least some information about ARMs.\n\nReactions to the Mortgage Shopping Worksheet (CHARM Booklet pages 2 and 3)\n\n\n\n. Nearly all participants thought this worksheet would be a useful tool for someone who was shopping for a \nmortgage. Several commented that the worksheet would remind them of what loan terms and conditions might be \nimportant and that it could act as a guide to help them ask the necessary questions. Others focused on the fact that \nthe worksheet would help them compare terms between loans.\n\n. There was some disagreement among participants about whether the Mortgage Shopping Worksheet should be in \nelectronic or paper format. Some participants preferred a paper format because they would be able to carry the \nworksheet to different banks and either complete it themselves or have the lender or broker complete it. However, \nother participants liked the electronic format because it would allow them to enter the data and complete \ncalculations. Several participants felt it would be best to have both formats available.\n\n. Participants provided only two concrete suggestions for improving the worksheet. The first was to define the \nacronym \"ARM,\" since consumers might use the worksheet independently of the rest of the booklet. A few \nparticipants also thought the worksheet should include a numerical example to illustrate how to complete the form.\n\nReactions to the Glossary (CHARM Booklet pages 30 through 34)\n\n. Participants were specifically asked to comment on the usefulness of the glossary. All participants thought the \nglossary was a valuable part of the booklet because it included definitions and explanations of important terms that \nare sometimes difficult for consumers to find.\n\n. Several participants gave suggestions for how the glossary could be made more effective, including bolding the \nwords in the text that appear in the glossary, adding references to the glossary earlier in the booklet, including the \ndefinitions in the text as footnotes, or embedding definitions in the text itself.\n\nParticipants' Suggested Revisions to the CHARM Booklet\n\n. Several participants said that including more explicit warnings about the risks of ARMs might make consumers \nread the information more carefully. Some of the suggested phrases included, \"It's really important for you to read \nthis because your life depends on it,\" or \"Foreclosure is inevitable if you don't understand what's in this book.\"\n\n. A few participants suggested that including information on how mortgage rates are determined might help \nconsumers forecast their future rates.\n\n. Other content participants suggested adding to the booklet included:\n. Differences between fixed-rate versus ARM products;\n\n. Additional detail about late charges and prepayment penalties;\n\n. More emphasis on the need to refinance before the interest rate adjusts; and\n\n. A description of how taxes change as the interest rate changes.. Some participants suggested improving the \nformat of the booklet to make it clearer and easier to read. Specific ideas included adding a table of contents and \nbolding or highlighting specific sections to emphasize their importance.\n\nDissemination of CHARM Information\n\n. To improve the likelihood of consumers seeing and understanding the information in the booklet, participants \nsuggested providing it in alternative formats such as audiotapes or DVDs. One participant pointed out an added \nadvantage of doing this would be that illiterate or semi-illiterate consumers would also be able to obtain the \n\n\n\ninformation. A large number of participants commented that the booklet should also be available online (as it \ncurrently is).\n\n. One participant suggested that the Board should require lenders and brokers to review this information with their \ncustomers and then have them sign a document saying they received and understood the information. Another felt \nthe Board should increase the amount of time consumers have before closing a loan so they will be able to read the \nbooklet and other information. 21. A large number of participants said that in addition to creating resources like the \nCHARM booklet, the government should also take other steps to educate consumers. Suggestions included \ncreating a \"Real Estate 101\" class for new home buyers, teaching high school students about loan products and \nhome ownership, offering free seminars, and providing loan counselors who would be required to act in consumers' \nbest interest.\n\nDesign Implications\n\n. Because most participants indicated that the CHARM booklet was too long and many said that as a result they \nwere unlikely to read it, the Board will propose in July 2009 that lenders no longer be required to provide this \ndocument to potential borrowers. However, the Board intends to continue to make this publication available for the \npurposes of consumer education, and plans to review it in the future to determine how it could be made more \nuseful for consumers.\n\n. Despite the fact that they felt it was too long, participants found a number of aspects of the CHARM booklet to be \nvaluable and informative, such as explanations of negative amortization, payment shock and other potentially risky \naspects of ARMs, and prepayment penalties. ICF Macro and Board staff incorporated this information into two new \none-page mandatory disclosures that were developed through this project and will be included in the Board's \nproposed rules, titled \"Key Questions to Ask About Your Mortgage\" and \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages.\" \nFor more information about the development of these new disclosures, see Chapter VI.\n\nCHAPTER IV: GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR DISCLOSURE DESIGN\n\nMuch of ICF Macro's design of revised disclosures was based directly on findings from cognitive testing. This \nreliance on direct consumer research is an important strategy for ensuring that disclosure forms are useful and \nunderstandable to their intended audiences. At the same time, there are a number of general principles to which \nICF Macro's designers try to adhere whenever engaged in this or similar projects. These principals include:\n\n. Use plain language. Jargon and technical language should be avoided whenever possible, and replaced with \nwords that are more easily understood by consumers. The use of simple language is particularly important in the \ncontext of disclosures, because consumers that are at the greatest risk of being taken advantage of are often those \nwith lower literacy levels. While readability metrics (such as the \"grade level\" of the writing) can be useful in this \nrespect, the best way to determine whether language is truly understandable is through direct consumer testing.\n\n. Prioritize information, and structure disclosures so that the most important information for consumers is \neasiest for them to find. Consumers frequently do not read disclosures carefully; those who look at them often \nonly skim them quickly to look for a few key pieces of information. If consumers cannot quickly find the information \nthey are looking for, they are likely to become frustrated and give up. Therefore, before, any design work can begin \n\n21 This participant may not have understood that the CHARM booklet should be given to consumers when they first inquire about \nan adjustable rate loan, before they even apply.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nthere must be some discussion to identify the most important pieces of information on the form. Those should be \nlocated most prominently on the disclosure, to increase the likelihood that even consumers who skim the form \nquickly can find and understand that information.\n\n. Provide information in a format that makes it easy to compare terms between disclosures. One purpose of \nmortgage disclosures is to serve as a tool to help consumers compare products from different lenders. Narrative \ntext is often difficult to compare in this way, because consumers cannot always identify the equivalent information \nbetween forms. Providing information in more structured formats, such as tables with consistent labels and \nheadings, facilitates this kind of shopping comparison.\n\n. Keep language and design elements consistent between forms so that information can be tracked over \ntime. In a disclosure regime like that currently in place for mortgages, consumers get information about the product \nfor which they are applying at multiple points in time. One goal of these disclosures is to help consumers track the \nterms of their loan at each stage in the process to make sure nothing changes without their knowledge. To facilitate \nthis, the structure and formatting of disclosure elements, as well as the language that is used to describe various \naspects of the product, should be made consistent between disclosures whenever possible. For example, several \naspects of the revised TILA statements were integrated into the initial program disclosures as well, to make it easy \nfor consumers to confirm that the loan they were considering accepting matched what they had originally discussed \nwith their lender.\n\n. Use headings and titles to make documents more navigable, and to help consumers find the information \nthey are looking for. When large amounts of text are included, plain language headings should be used to \ndistinguish sections on different topics. In tables, rows and columns should have short, easy-to-read titles that \naccurately describe the information that is provided. This allows consumers to find information that they are looking \nfor quickly and efficiently, and decreases the likelihood that they will become distracted by unrelated text.\n\n. Group related concepts and figures. Mortgage disclosures, particularly TILA statements, contain a great deal of \ndisparate information about a loan. Consumers are likely to find it easier to absorb and make sense of the \ninformation if it is grouped in a logical way so they do not have to constantly shift their mindset as they read. For \nexample, the revised TILA statement groups all information about potentially risky features of the loan into a single \nsection of the form.\n\n. When possible, provide information in multiple formats to accommodate different learning styles. Current \ndisclosures provide information in a mostly narrative format, accompanied by tables of figures. While this structure \nmay be very appropriate for some consumers, others might benefit from an alternative presentation using graphics \nor other heuristics. While this strategy must be balanced with the desire to make efficient use of space, it can often \nhave significant benefits for consumer comprehension. This approach was implemented in the APR section of the \nrevised TILA statement, which uses a graphic scale to provide context for the loan's APR.\n\n. Build off of prior research whenever possible. While each type of disclosure is different, findings from cognitive \ntesting can often translate between different documents. The applicability of a disclosure format in a new context \nshould always be confirmed through cognitive testing, but it often provides a useful starting point. For example, \nsome of the revisions to the way the APR is described on the TILA statement were inspired by findings from ICF \n\n\n\nMacro's earlier testing of credit card disclosures for the Board. ICF Macro's design work was also informed by \nfindings from its testing of disclosures related to broker compensation. 22\n\nCHAPTER V: DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF REVISED TILA STATEMENTS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAfter completing the background testing phase of the project, ICF Macro project staff met with Board staff to discuss \nkey findings from consumer testing. Following this meeting, ICF Macro's design team developed several revised \ndisclosures which were intended to address the weaknesses of the current forms. These forms were then tested \nthrough six rounds of cognitive interviews from November 2008 through May 2009. The specific forms that were \ntested changed in each round, but in each case the findings from one round informed revisions that were made to \nthe forms for the next round. A more detailed description of each round of testing, as well as the topics that were \ncovered, can be found in Appendix A.\n\nThe remainder of this report is focused on describing these iterative rounds of testing and form design. This chapter \n(Chapter V) focuses exclusively on the development and testing of revised TILA statements, which was the primary \nfocus of these interviews. Chapter VI describes work that ICF Macro conducted on other types of mortgage \ndisclosures provided at application or after closing.\n\nFor each round of testing that is presented in this chapter, the report begins by describing the objectives and \nmethodology used in that set of interviews, including the different forms tested and the structure of the interview \nprotocol. This is followed by an overview of key interview findings and a description of significant design decisions \nmade following that round.\n\nROUND 8: ATLANTA, GEORGIA (NOVEMBER 2008)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nIn November 2008, ICF Macro conducted nine cognitive interviews in Atlanta, GA. These interviews focused \nprimarily on testing two proposed formats for a revised TILA statement and gathering data on how consumers \nmight shop between loans using these forms. The interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Participants in the interviews were first asked to review a TILA statement in one of two formats (version A or B) \nthat described a 3/1 ARM product. They were then asked a series of questions designed to test their \ncomprehension of the content on the form.\n\n22 Research on disclosures related to broker compensation was conducted during Rounds 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the background \nresearch phase of this project. ICF Macro submitted findings on this topic to the Board under separate cover; this report is \navailable at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714regzconstest.pdf. ICF Macro's final reports related \nto its design and testing of credit card reports are available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20081218a.htm.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. Next, participants were given a second form in the same format describing a different 3/1 ARM. They were asked \nto compare the two loans and decide which loan they would choose. The purpose of this exercise was to gather \ninformation on which terms participants considered when comparing two loans.\n\n. After this shopping simulation, participants were shown the alternative version of the TILA statement and asked \nto compare several aspects of the two forms in terms of their clarity and usefulness.\n\n. Finally, participants were shown a table and graph that explained in more detail what could happen to their \nmonthly payments, and were then asked questions to test their comprehension of the information. This table and \ngraph showed what would happen to monthly payments under two scenarios: if market rates stayed the same \n(Scenario A) and if rates increased to the maximum allowed each year (Scenario B).\n\nThis first round of developmental testing focused on key terms that would likely be most prominent on a revised \nTILA. Additional content was added to the TILA in subsequent rounds. Six forms were used during the interviews; \nall are provided in Appendix D:\n\n. TILA statements A1 and A2 (both have the same format, but different loan terms);\n\n. TILA statements B1 and B2 (same loan terms as their respective A forms, but with an alternative format); and\n\n. A payment scenario graph and table showing how payments could change over the life of the loan.\n\nKey Interview Findings\n\nInitial Reactions to the Form\n\n. Each interview participant was asked to \"think aloud\" when reading through the TILA statement. In general, \nparticipants immediately noticed the interest rate, maximum interest rate, and the prepayment penalty. Most also \nnoticed the finance charges, although they did not express as much interest in this information. Two participants \ncommented they liked to know in advance what their payments would be.\n\nLoan Obligation\n\n. Most participants did not notice the text in the \"Your Rights as a Borrower\" section that indicated they were not \nobligated to accept the loan shown. However, even those who did not notice this text still understood they were \nunder no obligation to accept the loan.\n\nGeneral Loan Information\n\n. All participants correctly identified the term of the loan (30 years) and understood that it was an adjustable rate \nmortgage.\n\n\n\n. Participants were confused about the difference between the \"loan amount\" and the \"amount financed.\" When \nasked to identify the amount of money they were borrowing, five participants indicated it was $ 200,000 (the \"loan \namount\") while four stated it was $ 195,250 (the \"amount financed\"). Two participants indicated the difference \nbetween the two was due to the amount of \"prepaid finance charges\" listed on the form, but it was unclear whether \neither understood what this meant.\n\nSettlement Charges\n\n. Participants were asked about their understanding of settlement charges as illustrated on the sample form. Four \nparticipants indicated they did not know what \"total estimated settlement charges\" were. Others indicated that \nsettlement charges included a variety of costs associated with the loan, such as the appraisal fee, legal fees, \nprepaid items, loan fees, taxes, documents, escrow, loan origination fee, processing fee, and title charges.\n\n. Three participants were asked to describe the difference between settlement charges and \"closing costs\"; all said \nthat the two terms were interchangeable.\n\n. Participants all understood that \"cash to closing\" was related to the amount of money they would be expected to \nbring to the closing. However, two participants thought they would also have to pay the settlement costs shown at \nclosing--that is, they believed the two figures were distinct and did not overlap.\n\n. Interview participants were asked why the \"cash to closing\" amount might be less than the total estimated \nsettlement charges (as it was in the model form used in this round of testing). Three participants indicated that \nsome settlement charges could have been rolled into the cost of the loan, while one said that the seller might be \npaying some of the settlement charges. The remaining participants did not understand why the \"cash to closing\" \nfigure might be lower.\n\n. Version B displayed the settlement charges and cash to closing at the top of the form, while version A showed \nthese terms in a separate section at the bottom. All but one participant indicated that they preferred to have this \ninformation near the top of the page.\n\nAPR and Finance Charge\n\n. When asked to explain what \"finance charges\" are, participants were generally unsure. Most thought the finance \ncharges were equal to the amount of interest that the borrower would pay over time; only a few understood the \nfinance charges shown on the form included fees as well as interest. At least one participant was unsure whether \nprincipal was also included in the figure for finance charges shown.\n\n. When asked to explain what the \"APR\" was, most participants indicated they did not know. Several indicated that \nthe APR was the same as their interest rate. Others knew the APR was different from the interest rate but were \nunable to articulate how. A few participants commented that they primarily thought of this term as relating to credit \ncards.\n\n\n\n. Most participants did not read the definitions of finance charge and APR during their first review of the form. After \nbeing directed to read these definitions, some participants realized that the finance charge included fees. Even after \nreading the definition of the APR, however, participants were unable to explain in their own words what it was.\n\n. Because the APR and finance charge are more useful shopping tools when they are calculated over the specific \nlength of time the borrower expects to hold the loan, the forms used in this round showed these terms over three \ndifferent time horizons: 3 years, 5 years, and 30 years. Most of the participants, however, expressed confusion as \nto why the APR would vary over time. A few said the APR would increase over time because the interest rate would \nincrease at the end of the introductory period, but most had no explanation. Participants' confusion in this respect \nwas generally due to the fact that they did not understand what the APR signified.\n\n. When asked how they would use the finance charges or APR in their decision-making, most participants indicated \nthat they would not. Almost all participants indicated they would be much more likely to compare loans based on the \ninterest rate than on the APR. One commented that he thought the APR would be useful if they expected to be in a \nhome for 15 to 30 years, but not in the shorter term. Two specifically stated that the APR was too confusing for it to \nbe useful to them.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\n. All interview participants were able to correctly identify the initial interest rate (5.625%) and the period for which \nthe rate would apply (3 years, or until 2011). However, participants were unsure what would happen after that point. \nA few participants said that the interest rate would definitely go up after 3 years, but this was usually based on a \ngeneral assumption that interest rates for ARMs tend to increase. The remaining participants thought the rate could \ngo up or down depending on the market. None of the participants understood that the loan described in the form \noffered a discounted introductory rate.\n\n. When the interview participants were asked what would cause their interest rate to go up or down, they gave a \nvariety of responses, including \"the market\"; \"the economy\"; the prime rate; the \"Fed rate,\" and the Consumer Price \nIndex. All of these responses seemed to reflect a common belief that rates would change based on external market \nforces over which they had no control.\n\n. All interview participants were able to correctly identify the maximum highest payment ($ 2,165.97), the maximum \ninterest rate (11.625%), and the year in which it could reach this amount (2013). Participants generally understood \nthat the highest possible payment and rate were only maximums, and would not definitely be reached.\n\n. Most participants understood the interest rates and respective payments shown on the form as initial and \n\"maximum ever\" terms. They were much less clear as to the meaning of the middle interest rate and payment, \nwhich represented the maximum at the first adjustment.\n\n. Most participants indicated that the amount shown on the forms for \"estimated taxes and insurance\" included \nproperty taxes, county taxes, and local taxes. Most participants thought the term \"insurance\" related to \nhomeowner's insurance, while a few thought it might also include private mortgage insurance (PMI). All participants \nrecognized that while this was shown as a fixed amount on the form, both taxes and insurance could also vary over \ntime--although some commented that they would not expect this amount to vary much.\n\n\n\n. Versions A and B of the TILA statement both included a table of interest rates and monthly payments, but these \ntables were formatted very differently. This difference did not have a noticeable effect on participants' \ncomprehension of the information. However, most interview participants indicated that they preferred the payment \ntable shown in version B because a) it allowed them add the different pieces of their monthly payment from top to \nbottom, rather than left to right; and b) it presented changes over time from left to right, rather than from top to \nbottom. Two participants also noted that version B used the term \"introductory rate,\" which they found more \ndescriptive than \"initial rate,\" the term used in version A.\n\nRisk Factors/Key Questions\n\nVersions A and B both included a section labeled Risk Factors, but the sections were formatted very differently. \nVersion A listed two potentially risky features of the loan--the fact that the interest rate was adjustable and the fact \nthat the loan included a prepayment penalty. Version B, on the other hand, listed six \"key questions\" related to \npotential risks, such as \"Can my interest rate increase?\" \"Could I owe a balloon payment?\" and \"Will I owe a balloon \npayment?\" Each question was answered \"Yes\" or \"No,\" with additional explanation provided with \"Yes\" answers.\n\n. Regardless of which version they were shown, all but one interview participant understood that the loan they were \nshown included a prepayment penalty.\n\n. The four interview participants who reviewed version B were asked about their understanding of the six key \nquestions listed on the form.\n\n. All of the participants understood the questions related to changing interest rates, changing monthly \npayments, and prepayment penalties.\n\n. While most participants understood what was meant by a \"balloon payment\" when they read the questions \nand answers, one thought it pertained to paying down principal on the loan.\n\n. Most participants were confused by the questions \"Will my monthly payments cover only interest and no \nprincipal?\" and \"Can my loan balance increase?\" While these questions refer to interest-only payments and \nnegative amortization, respectively, very few participants understood what they meant. For example, one \nparticipant thought that his/her loan balance would increase if the interest rate increased, while another thought \nthe question referred to whether or not the borrower would be able to refinance in the future for more money.\n\n. Participants were asked to directly compare versions A and B and indicate which format they preferred. All \nparticipants indicated that they preferred the \"key questions\" format of version B because they found it easier to \nread and more informative. Several also liked the fact that version B showed which risk factors did not apply to the \nloan, as well as those that did.\n\nMortgage Shopping Simulation\n\nIn one portion of the interview, participants were asked to review two TILA statements that showed loans with \ndifferent terms and indicate which they would choose and why. Loan 1 had lower settlement costs and slightly \nhigher interest rates and monthly payments, while Loan 2 had higher settlement costs and lower interest rates and \npayments.\n\n\n\n. Participants focused almost exclusively on the interest rate, monthly payment, and settlement charges, and cash \ndue at closing when making their decisions. Very few compared the finance charges or APRs of the two loans.\n\n. Participants were split as to which of the loans they would choose. Three participants stated they would choose \nLoan 1, while four said they would choose Loan 2. The remainder did not express a clear opinion or indicated they \nwould choose the loan based on the period they planned to retain the loan. Most indicated they would have difficulty \ndeciding between the two loans, because the differences between them were so small.\n\n. Some participants indicated their choice between the two loans would depend on their situation--for example, \nwhether they could afford to pay higher settlement charges, or whether they specifically needed lower monthly \npayments.\n\n. When asked whether it would make a difference if they knew that they were going to hold the loan for either 3 \nyears or 30 years, most participants said that it would not. A few participants, however, revised their selection \nbased on the concept that trading higher settlement charges for lower payments makes more sense in the long \nterm, while accepting higher payments in return for lower settlement charges would make more sense in the short \nterm.\n\n. Participants were generally confused to find that the APR and finance charges for one of the loans were lower \nthan the other for a 3-year term but higher for a 30-year term. Most participants did not understand why this would \nbe the case.\n\nPayment Change Scenario Table and Graph\n\nAfter they completed their first review of the TILA, participants were shown a graph and corresponding table \nshowing more detail about how their monthly mortgage payment would change over time under two different \nscenarios. The terms shown in the graph and table matched those in the first TILA statement that participants were \nshown.\n\n. All participants understood the distinction between the two scenarios shown in the table and graph (\"market rates \nstay the same\" vs. \"maximum possible rate and payment\").\n\n. All participants understood the \"Year of Loan,\" \"Period Beginning,\" and \"# of Payments\" columns in the table, \nalthough one commented that the number of payments was redundant and unnecessary.\n\n. Almost all participants understood from both the table and graph that even if market rates stayed the same, their \npayment would increase after three years. Several indicated that this surprised them, because this was not \napparent from the first page of the TILA. However, the table did not improve understanding of why rates would \nincrease if market rates stayed the same; even after seeing both the table and graph none of the participants \nunderstood that the loan in question had a discounted introductory rate.\n\n. When looking at the graph and table, all participants understood that their rate and payment would never be higher \nthan the maximum shown. Some, however, incorrectly thought that the rate and payment could never go below \nthan the amounts shown for Scenario A (the scenario under which market rates stayed constant). This \nmisconception was particularly prevalent when participants were looking at the graph; several incorrectly assumed \nthat their payment would always fall between the two lines shown.\n\n\n\n. Most participants indicated that they found the table easier to understand than the graph; one said that he 23 \nwould not look at information presented in graphical format because he would assume it was difficult to understand.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. Because all but one participant in this round preferred to have information about settlement charges provided near \nthe top of the form, all forms developed for subsequent rounds of testing included these charges in the Loan \nSummary section at the top of the page.\n\n. Several participants did not understand the relationship between \"cash to close\" and settlement charges. To \naddress this confusion, forms developed for the next round showed the arithmetic relationship between total \nsettlement charges, cash to close, pre-paid fees, and fees that were rolled into the loan amount.\n\nAPR and Finance Charge\n\n. Participants in Atlanta had a great deal of difficulty interpreting the table showing APRs and finance charges for \nmultiple time horizons; most, in fact, had no understanding of why APRs over different time periods would vary. \nTherefore, the decision was made to highlight only a single APR and finance charge.\n\n. Some participants connected the term \"APR\" with its meaning in a credit card context, and as a result assumed \nthat the APR was the same as their interest rate. To address this potential confusion, forms used in the next round \nused two different labels for the Annual Percentage Rate: \"This Loan's Price Tag\" and \"Total Cost.\"\n\n. Most participants in Atlanta found the lengthy description of the APR that was provided to be confusing. The forms \ntested in the next round used a simpler, shorter phrase to describe this term (\"the interest rate when some closing \ncosts are factored in\"). Variations of this shorter description were used in forms for all subsequent rounds.\n\nDespite the explanation provided on the forms, some participants in Atlanta did not understand that the APR \nrepresented a combination of both interest and fees. Therefore, one of the forms tested in the following round tried \nto display this relationship more explicitly as an \"equation\" (interest rate + fees = APR).\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\n. Participants found the rate and payment table used in version B (which showed payment components vertically \nand time periods and payment changes horizontally) significantly easier to understand. Therefore, all forms for \nsubsequent rounds included a table with this format.\n\n. Because several participants indicated they preferred the label \"introductory rate\" to \"initial rate,\" all subsequent \nforms used this phrasing.\n\n. Several participants in this round had difficulty understanding how their rate could change over time, therefore, \nexplanatory text was added under the heading \"Rate Change.\" This text disclosed the length of the introductory \nperiod, the index and margin that would be used to determine the rate after the introductory period ended, and the \n\n23 To protect participants' confidentiality, this report will refer to individual participants as \"he\" regardless of the actual gender of \nthe participant.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nperiodic and lifetime rate change caps. The new text also stated that the loan had a discounted introductory rate, \nsince none of the participants in this round realized that this was the case. This \"Rate Change\" information was \nadded below the Payment Summary table.\n\n. Because several participants indicated they would not use the payment change scenario graph, and because it \nwould take up a great deal of space on the form, this graph was not included in any subsequent forms.\n\n. While several participants had difficulty understanding the payment change scenario table that was tested this \nround, there was some evidence that others did benefit from more specific information about how their rates and \npayments would change over time. Therefore, this table was included in one of the versions tested in the following \nround (version D).\n\nRisk Factors/Key Questions\n\n. Participants in this round responded positively to the question and answer format used in the Risk Factors section \nof version B. Therefore, this format was used in all subsequent forms.\n\n. Participants also liked the fact that version B indicated which risk factors were not associated with the loan being \ndescribed, as well as those that were. Therefore, the forms developed for the next round included all Key \nQuestions, even those to which the answer was \"No.\" This issue was revisited in the Dallas round of testing (Round \n10).\n\n. Most participants who were shown version B had difficulty understanding the Key Questions related to interest-\nonly payments and negative amortization. As a result, the wording of these questions was revised for the forms \ntested in the following round.\n\nROUND 9: BETHESDA, MARYLAND (JANUARY 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nIn January 2009, ICF Macro conducted nine cognitive interviews in Bethesda, MD. As with the previous round of \ninterviews, the Bethesda round focused primarily on testing two proposed formats for a revised TILA statement and \ngathering data on how consumers might shop between loans using these forms. The interview protocol included \nthe following sections:\n\n. Participants in the interviews were first asked to review a TILA statement in one of these two formats (versions C \nor D) that described a 3/1 or 5/1 ARM product. They were then asked a series of questions designed to test their \ncomprehension of the content on the form.\n\n. Next, participants were given a set of two TILA forms in the same format that described two fixed-rate loans. They \nwere asked to compare the two loans and decide which they would choose. As in the previous round, the purpose \nof this exercise was to gather information about which terms participants consider when selecting between loans. \nThe decision was made in this round to use fixed-rate loans rather than ARMs to simplify the comparison for \nparticipants.\n\n. After this shopping simulation, participants were shown the alternative TILA statement and asked to compare \nseveral aspects of the two forms in terms of clarity and usefulness.\n\n. After reviewing the TILA statements, participants were asked to review some text for additional required \ndisclosures about possible lender actions, loan assumption, property insurance, demand features, and refund of \nfinance charges. The goal of this section of the interview was to assess the extent to which participants understood \nthis language.\n\nVersion D included some information that was not on version C, including a table providing more detail about future \nchanges in rates and payments (the payment change scenario table tested in the previous round) and a table \n\n\n\nshowing APRs and finance charges for three different time horizons. As a result, version D was printed on two \nletter-sized pages. Version C was printed on one legal-sized page, as were the forms used in the previous round.\n\nAll TILA statements for this round (Round 9) included a section labeled \"Optional Features,\" which contained \ninformation on credit life insurance, reduced documentation loans, and owner's title insurance.\n\nSeven forms were used in these sections of the interview; all are provided in Appendix D:\n\n. TILA statements C1, C2, and C3 (all forms had the same format, but C1 was a 3/1 ARM while C2 and C3 were \nfixed-rate loans);\n\n. TILA statements D1, D2, and D3 (same terms as C1, C1, and C3, but with an alternative format); and\n\n. A separate page of additional required disclosures. 24Key Interview Findings\n\nInitial Reactions to the Form\n\n. When asked what information was most important to them on the TILA statement, participants most frequently \nmentioned the interest rate (3 participants), monthly payment (2), Key Questions About Your Loan (2), the loan \ntype (2), and the loan amount (2). Other items mentioned as most important included the timing of the interest rate \nadjustments, the fact that taxes and insurance were included in the monthly payments, and the boldface language \nat the bottom of the form indicating not to sign the form if you do not understand the terms.\n\n. When asked whether there was any information that was not on the form that they would want to know, some \nparticipants commented that they would want a more detailed breakdown of their settlement charges.\n\nLoan Obligation\n\n. Most participants did not notice the text at the top of the form that indicated they were not obligated to accept the \nloan shown. However, most interview participants who did not notice this text still understood they were under no \nobligation to accept the loan.\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. Eight of nine participants correctly identified the term of the loan (30 years). All participants understood that the \nloan being described was an adjustable rate mortgage.\n\n. When asked to identify the amount of money they were borrowing, five of nine participants correctly identified the \nloan amount shown on the form. Two participants incorrectly subtracted from the loan amount the down payment \nshown on the form, while one thought he was borrowing the \"amount financed.\" The remaining participant thought \nhe was borrowing the amount financed plus the finance charge.\n\n. When asked if they could identify the price of the home they were purchasing, most participants added the loan \namount and down payment together to obtain the price of the home. None answered this question correctly, which \nwould have required subtracting the closing costs that were included in the loan amount.\n\n. Generally, interview participants did not understand the concept of the \"amount financed.\" The two participants \nwho came closest to correctly explaining this term said that it was the loan amount less the closing costs--although \n\n24 For the second day of testing, these disclosures were integrated into the TILA statements rather than being shown on a \nseparate page.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nboth noticed that based on the numbers shown on the form, this was not true. Others gave a variety of incorrect \nexplanations for the amount financed, including that it was \"how much escrow they would have,\" the amount they \nwould have to pay back, or the amount that they borrowed.\n\n. Both versions of the TILA tested in this round broke closing costs into three categories: \"paid before closing,\" \n\"included in loan amount,\" and \"due at closing.\" In general, most participants did not understand the significance of \nthese categories. For example, only four of the nine participants understood that the \"due at closing\" figure was \nwhat they would have to pay at settlement, and only three understood that they were effectively borrowing the costs \n\"included in loan amount.\"\n\n. At least four participants confused the phrase \"closing costs\" with the amount that they would have to pay at \nclosing when in fact some would be paid before closing. This misunderstanding persisted despite the fact that the \ncosts \"due at closing\" were listed on the form.\n\n. When asked whether they preferred the use of the term \"settlement charges\" or \"closing costs,\" most participants \nthought the two phrases had identical meanings. One thought settlement charges were a subset of closing costs, \nwhile another suggested \"loan fees\" as an alternative term.\n\nAPR and Finance Charge\n\n. Only one of the nine participants understood that the APR included both interest and fees. About half thought that \nthe terms APR and interest rate were identical in meaning, while others knew the APR was different but could not \narticulate how.\n\n. When participants were asked how they would use the APR, all but two indicated they would not use the term. Of \nthe two that indicated they would use it for shopping and comparing loans, one misinterpreted the APR as the \n\"average interest rate\" over time.\n\n. Comprehension of the finance charge was higher than that of the APR; all but one participant was able to correctly \ndescribe what the finance charges signified. However, only one of the nine participants indicated that he would find \nthis information useful.\n\n. Versions C and D displayed the APR and finance charge in two very different formats. On version C, the APR and \nfinance charge were provided in a box labeled \"This Loan's Price Tag.\" Version D included a horizontal box across \nthe page labeled \"Total Cost\" that presented the initial interest rate, settlement charges, APR and finance charge in \nthe form of an equation. 25 Participants were split when asked which format they preferred; four preferred this \naspect of version D while three preferred version C. However, regardless of which form participants were shown \ncomprehension of the APR was minimal.. As in the previous round, participants were generally confused by the \ntable on the second page of version D that showed the APR and finance charge over 3, 5, and 30 years. Few could \nexplain why the APR would vary based on the time horizon used. Almost all participants ignored this table, except \nwhen specifically asked questions about it.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\nUnderstanding of Adjustable Rate\n\n25 The equation was stated as follows: interest rate + estimated closing costs = APR & finance charge.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n. All but one participant were able to correctly identify both the initial interest rate and when the first rate adjustment \ncould take place. Six of the nine were able to indicate how often the interest rate would change.\n\n. All participants understood that the loan described by the versions C 1 and D1 had an adjustable rate. However, \nonly two understood that their initial rate was discounted, so a rate increase after the introductory period was very \nlikely.\n\n. Most participants believed that it was much more likely that their rate would increase than that it would decrease. \nHowever, this was based on a general distrust of adjustable rate products, rather than anything they saw on the \nform.\n\n. When participants were asked why their interest rate would fluctuate, most correctly stated it was the \"market\" or \n\"market rate.\" As in previous rounds of testing, participants had a variety of explanations for what this \"market rate\" \nwas based on, including the housing market, the \"average going rate\" for mortgages, and \"the economy.\" One \nparticipant correctly stated that the \"market rate\" was based on the rate the banks paid to borrow their money.\n\n. All interview participants were able to correctly identify the maximum interest rate, and eight of nine were able to \nidentify the year in which it could first reach this amount. However, most participants did not recognize the \nrelationship between the year the maximum could be hit and the periodic caps described on the form.\n\nPayment Summary Table\n\n. The Payment Summary tables used in versions C and D both showed the introductory and \"maximum ever\" rate \nand payment for the loan. Version C also included a third column that showed the maximum rate and payment at \nfirst adjustment. Two participants were confused by the difference between the \"maximum at first adjustment\" and \n\"maximum ever\" columns in the table. However, several other participants commented that the information about \nwhat could happen at the first adjustment was very important to them.\n\n. Most participants indicated that when evaluating a loan, the maximum payment would be more important to them \nthan the initial payment because they would want to make sure they could afford the highest possible payment. \nTwo, however, said that the initial payment was more important because they would expect to refinance out of the \nloan before it hit the maximum.\n\n. When specifically asked to read the information under the heading \"Rate Change,\" participants generally \nunderstood the text about rate caps. Most also seemed to understand the concept of an index and margin, although \nnone understood the term \"LIBOR.\" n26Taxes and Insurance (Escrow)\n\n. All participants understood that they would be required to pay taxes and insurance as part of their monthly \npayment. All but two recognized that the cost of taxes and insurance could change over time and that the amount \non the form was only an estimate.\n\n. When asked what was included in the amount shown for taxes and insurance, most indicated that it included \nproperty taxes and homeowner's insurance. Two participants thought it might include costs shown elsewhere in the \nform, such as title insurance or credit life insurance. Another thought it included private mortgage insurance (PMI).\n\n. The term \"escrow\" was shown on the form next to the itemization of taxes and insurance. All but two participants \nunderstood what this term meant. In almost all cases, however, this understanding was based on prior knowledge \nrather than the description provided on the form.\n\nPayment Change Scenario Table (Version D1)\n\n. The payment change scenario table on version Dl did not significantly improve participants' understanding of what \nwould happen to their rate and payment. Even after reviewing this table most participants did not understand that \ntheir introductory rate was discounted and would likely increase at the end of the introductory period.\n\n\n\n. When reviewing the payment change scenario table, most participants understood that over time their rate and \npayment could be between the figures shown for Scenarios A and B, and also that they could not be above the \namount shown for Scenario B. As in the previous round, however, some incorrectly thought that the rate and \npayment could not go below the amount shown for Scenario A (the scenario under which market rates stayed \nconstant).\n\n. When asked to assess the importance of the payment change scenario table, most participants indicated that it \nwas not important because it largely repeated information provided elsewhere on the form. A few, however, \ncommented that this table provided useful detail and showed more clearly that the interest rate could increase even \nif the market rates stayed the same.\n\nKey Questions Section\n\n. All participants understood they would be charged a pre-payment penalty if they paid off the loan, refinanced, or \nsold the property within 3 years. All also understood the questions related to rate and payment change and late \npayment fees.\n\n. Participants' understanding of the term \"balloon payment\" was inconsistent. Five were able to accurately define a \nballoon payment, while four gave a variety of incorrect definitions of the term, such as a higher payment due to a \nrate increase or a final loan payment that is lower than previous payments. One person confused a balloon \npayment with a jumbo loan.\n\n. All participants understood the meaning of the question related to interest-only mortgages. However, several who \nwere unfamiliar with this type of loan were confused as to why payments would ever be interest-only.\n\n. Only two of the nine participants understood the question \"Can my balance increase even after I've made \npayments?\" Others had a variety of misinterpretations; some, for example, thought that the question referred to \nwhether the lender could add a late fee to the loan principal or whether the borrower could borrow more money in \nthe future, such as with a line of credit. Others thought this question was redundant with the question related to \ninterest-only payments.\n\n. When asked about the relative importance of the questions shown, several participants commented that the \ninformation about late payment fees would be less valuable to them because they would already expect to be \ncharged a fee for making a late payment.\n\nCredit Life Insurance and Other Optional Features\n\n. About half of participants did not understand that this section showed features that were already included in their \nhypothetical loan. Instead, they thought these features were being offered to them at this point.\n\n. When specifically asked what they could do to lower the cost of the loan, most participants did not understand that \nthe credit insurance product was optional and could be declined in order to lower the cost of the loan.\n\n. None of the participants understood what was meant by a \"No Doc or Low Doc\" loan. About half understood the \nmeaning of \"credit life insurance\" and \"owner's title insurance,\" although several thought that title insurance was a \nrequired, not optional, feature.\n\nMortgage Shopping Simulation\n\nIn one portion of the interview, participants were asked to review two TILA statements that showed loans with \ndifferent terms and indicate which they would choose and why. Loan 3 had a higher interest rate (6.5% vs. 6.25%), \nand a slightly higher monthly payment. Loan 2, however, included a large amount of closing costs that were \nincluded in the loan amount. As a result, Loan 2 had a higher APR than Loan 3. Both were fixed-rate loans and did \nnot require the borrower to pay anything at closing.\n\n\n\n. Seven of the nine participants selected Loan 3, while two selected Loan 2.\n\n. The two participants selecting Loan 2 stated they chose this loan because of the lower monthly payment and lower \ninterest rate. Neither noticed the $ 15,470 in closing costs that were rolled into the loan amount.\n\n. Most of the participants who selected Loan 3 based their decision at least in part on the fact the APR for that loan \nwas lower. However, as they discussed their decision it was clear that most of these participants did not understand \nwhat the APR represented. For example, two pointed to the APR and indicated that the \"interest rate\" was lower for \nLoan 3, when in fact this was not the case.\n\n. When it was pointed out to participants that Loan 2 had a higher APR but a lower interest rate, almost none of the \nparticipants were able to explain how this could be.\n\n. When asked if the length of time they planned to hold the loan would make a difference in their selection of the \nloan, almost all indicated that it would not. Only one participant who was comparing version D forms looked at the \ntable on the second page that showed APRs and finance charges for different time horizons.\n\nOther Required Disclosure Text\n\nIn addition to testing revised TILA statements, another goal of this round was to assess participants' understanding \nof text related to other required disclosures. On the first day of interviews, participants were shown these \nstatements on a separate sheet of paper. On the second day, the statements were integrated into the TILA \nstatements used in the shopping simulation.\n\n. Seven of the nine participants understood language indicating that the lender could demand the borrower pay off \nthe loan at any time All of those who understood the statement indicated it was an important piece of information.\n\n. Seven of the nine participants understood a statement that early payoff of the loan could result in a refund of \ninterest or fees. Participants who understood this text indicated that it was important information to them, although \nmost indicated it would likely not have an impact on whether or not they accepted the loan.\n\n. Seven of the nine participants understood a sentence indicating that the borrower \"can obtain insurance from \nanyone that is also acceptable to the lender.\" One of the two who misunderstood this sentence thought it meant \nthat he was being charged PMI. Among those who understood the meaning of this text, most indicated it was not \nimportant because they already knew this information.\n\n. Only four of nine participants understood language indicating that the loan could be assumed. One thought the \ntext referred to the lender \"selling\" the mortgage to another lender, while another thought assumption could only \ntake place if the original borrower defaulted. Two thought that the fact that a buyer could assume the loan would be \na negative feature for the original borrower.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. Some participants were confused by the fact that the down payment was shown on the TILA statement, and \nincorrectly thought that the amount they would be borrowing would be the \"loan amount\" shown on the page less \ntheir down payment. Therefore, the down payment was removed to simplify the form and improve comprehension.\n\n. The description of \"Loan Type\" on the forms used in Bethesda included information about rate changes, including \nthe length of the introductory period and the frequency with which the rate would adjust. This information was \nredundant with other sections of the form; therefore, the TILA statements used in the next round of testing did not \ninclude these details. Instead, they simply described the sample loan as a \"3/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM).\"\n\n\n\n. The mathematical relationship that was shown between total settlement charges, cash to close, pre-paid fees, \nand fees rolled into the loan amount did not improve consumer understanding of how these terms were related. \nTherefore, this section of the statement was eliminated from forms tested in the next round (Dallas). Instead, the \nLoan Amount section of these forms displayed the portion of the loan amount that was applied to settlement \ncharges.\n\n. Participants in the first two rounds (Rounds 8 and 9) generally did not understand the meaning of the amount \nfinanced. In addition, several participants in the first two rounds mistakenly thought the amount financed was the \namount of money they would be borrowing. Therefore, for the next round the amount financed was removed from \nthe Loan Summary section and the prepaid finance charge (the figure that is subtracted from the loan amount to \ndetermine the amount financed on the form) was placed in a footnote on the bottom of the page.\n\n. Some participants expressed a desire to see a more detailed breakdown of their settlement charges. Therefore, all \nTILA statements used in subsequent rounds included a reference to \"See your Good Faith Estimate for details.\"\n\nAPR and Finance Charge\n\n. As in the previous round, participants were generally confused by a table that showed APRs and finance charges \nfor three different time periods. In addition, only one of nine participants referred to this table when choosing \nbetween two loans. As a result, this table was not included in any forms for subsequent rounds.\n\n. Neither label used for information about the APR and finance charge (\"This Loan's Price Tag\" or \"Total Cost\") led \nto improved comprehension of these terms by participants. As a result, the forms used in the next round of testing \n(Dallas) used different labels for the APR: \"True Cost Factor\" and \"Overall Rate of Fees and Interest.\"\n\n. Explicitly displaying the relationship between interest rates, settlement charges, APR and finance charge, as was \ndone on version D, did not have a discernable impact on consumer understanding of the APR. Because of this, as \nwell as concerns that this format gave too much prominence to the initial interest rate, this \"equation format\" was \nnot used in subsequent TILA versions.\n\n. Participants in this and previous rounds generally disregarded the finance charge when reading their TILA \nstatements, other than commenting that the number was very large. Several commented that this information was \nnot useful, since they had no choice but to pay a large finance charge if they wanted to purchase a home. \nTherefore, on subsequent versions of the form the finance charge was deemphasized and moved from the top of \nthe first page to the \"More Information About Your Payments\" section under the heading \"Total Payments.\"\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\n. When asked to compare the Payment Summary tables on versions C and D, several participants commented that \nthe columns providing information about the maximum rate and payment at first adjustment was important to them. \nTherefore, all versions for subsequent rounds included this column in the Payment Summary table.\n\n. The presence of the more detailed Payment Change Scenario table on the second page of version D did not \nnoticeably improve most participants' understanding of what would happen to their rate and payment over time \nMost participants indicated that this table was not important to them, because it was largely redundant with other \nparts of the form. For this reason, this table was not included in any subsequent forms.\n\nKey Questions Section\n\n. As in previous rounds, participants continued to respond positively to the question and answer format used in the \nKey Questions section of the TILA statement. As a result, this format was retained in the forms for all subsequent \nrounds of testing.\n\n\n\n. Some participants did not realize that the Key Questions shown on the form were describing potentially risky loan \nfeatures. Therefore, on forms for all subsequent rounds the title of this section was changed from \"Key Questions \nAbout Your Loan\" to \"Key Questions About Risks.\"\n\n. For Round 9, an additional question about late payment fees had been added to the forms being tested. However, \nseveral participants indicated that this information was less important to them. Based on these results, all \nsubsequent forms did not include this question.\n\n. As in Atlanta, some participants in this round had difficulty understanding the difference between the questions \nrelated to interest-only payments and negative amortization. As a result, the wording of these questions was revised \nagain for the following round.\n\nCredit Life Insurance and Other Optional Features\n\n. Because participants generally did not understand the Optional Features section of the forms used in this round, \nthis section of the TILA was significantly restructured for the next round of testing. References to reduced \ndocumentation and owner's title insurance were dropped, and the credit life insurance disclosure was revised to \nclarify that the product is optional and could be declined.\n\nOther Required Disclosure Text\n\n. Participants indicated that information about loan demand features was particularly important to them, so the \ndecision was made to include this information on the TILA statement in the Key Questions section.\n\nROUND 10: DALLAS, TEXAS (FEBRUARY 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nIn February 2009, ICF Macro conducted 10 cognitive interviews in Dallas, TX. As in previous rounds, this round of \ninterviews focused primarily on testing two proposed formats for a revised TILA statement and gathering data on \nhow consumers might shop between loans using these forms.\n\nAs part of the interview, participants were shown several alternatives for how the APR could displayed. All of these \nalternatives provided context for how the loan's APR compared to that of other similar loans. All disclosed the \nboundary between prime and higher-priced loans; that boundary is 1.5 percentage points over the \"average prime \noffer rate\" (APOR) calculated by the Board for first lien loans and published each week. 27 Some of the APR \npresentations also disclosed the APOR itself, which was described as the average rate \"on comparable loans \nrecently offered to borrowers with excellent credit.\"The interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Participants in the interviews were first asked to review a TILA statement in one of two formats (versions E or F) \nthat described a 3/1 ARM product. They were then asked a series of questions designed to test their \ncomprehension of the content on the form.\n\n. Next, participants were given a second form describing a different 3/1 ARM in the same format, but with different \nterms. They were asked to compare the two loans and decide which they would choose. As in previous rounds, the \npurpose of this section of the interview was to gather information about which terms participants consider when \nselecting between two loans.\n\n27 The boundary is 3.5 percentage points for subordinate lien loans.\n\n \n\n\n\n. After this shopping simulation, participants were shown the alternative TILA statement and asked to compare \nseveral aspects of the two forms in terms of their clarity and usefulness.\n\n. After completing their review of the TILA statements, participants were then shown the alternative APR \npresentations and asked a series of questions designed to measure their comprehension of the information.\n\n. As in the previous round, after reviewing the TILA statements participants were asked to review some additional \ntext for required disclosures about possible lender actions, loan assumption, property insurance, refund of finance \ncharges, and late payment fees.\n\nThe TILA statements tested in this round included two new items in the Key Questions section. These questions \nrelated to loan demand features (\"Can my lender demand full repayment at anytime?\") and equity sharing features \n(\"Do I have to share any equity I gain?\").\n\nSix forms were used in these sections of the interview; all are provided in Appendix D:\n\n. TILA statements E1 and E2 (both have the same format, but different terms);\n\n. TILA statements F1 and F2 (same terms as El and E2, but with an alternative format);\n\n. A variety of alternate approaches to displaying the APR; and\n\n. Additional text for required disclosures.\n\nAll TILA statements used in this round of testing were printed on one legal-sized page.\n\nKey Interview Fin\n\nInitial Reactions to the Form\n\n. After participants first reviewed the TILA statement, they were asked what pieces of information on the form were \nmost important. Participants most often mentioned the monthly payment (5 participants), loan type (4), interest rate \n(4), key questions (3), loan amount (3), and term of loan (3).\n\nLoan Obligation\n\n. Most participants did not notice the text that indicated they were not obligated to accept the loan shown. However, \nall but one participant still understood they were under no obligation.\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. All participants correctly identified the term of the loan (30 years) and the amount borrowed.\n\n. When asked how much of the $ 200,000 loan they could apply to the price of the home they were purchasing, \nonly three participants understood that $ 198,000 would go toward the home purchase and the remaining $ 2,000 \nwould be used to pay for closing costs.\n\n. When asked if the Total Settlement Charges listed on the form included their down payment, half of the \nparticipants incorrectly stated that it did, while three more indicated they did not know.\n\nAPR\n\n. Two different labels were used for the APR in this round of testing; on version E the term was labeled \"True Cost \nFactor,\" while version F used the phrase \"Overall Rate of Fees + Interest.\" When asked to explain in their own \nwords the definition of this term, only two participants provided an, explanation related to its actual meaning. All \n\n\n\nother participants were confused by the term; for example, several thought the APR represented an \"average\" or \n\"overall\" interest rate. None of the participants were able to successfully explain how the \"True Cost Factor\" or \n\"Overall Rate of Fees plus Interest\" differed from the interest rate.\n\n . Version E displayed the APR (called the \"True Cost Factor\") without a percentage sign. This variation was an \nattempt to decrease the extent to which participants confused this term with their interest rate. However, this had no \nnoticeable impact on participant understanding; in fact, even participants who saw version E discussed the True \nCost Factor as if it was a percentage and confused it with their interest rate.\n\n. When asked to indicate whether they preferred the treatment of the APR on version E or F, about half of \nparticipants selected each form. As in the previous round, however, participant comprehension of the APR was \nextremely low regardless of which version participants were shown.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\nUnderstanding of Adjustable Rate\n\n. All interview participants were able to correctly identify the initial interest rate. All participants also understood that \nthe loan had an adjustable rate and that the rate and payment would be fixed for the first three years. Participants \nalso were able to correctly identify the size of their payment during that time.\n\n. Most participants understood that the rate could change annually after the third year, but two did not know how \noften the rate could change.\n\n. Almost all participants were able to correctly identify the maximum interest rate of the loan. One participant was \nconfused by the text below the table that indicated the rate could increase by 2% each year, and mistakenly thought \nthis meant there was no maximum rate.\n\nPayment Summary Table\n\n. Several participants mistakenly thought the different columns in the payment table represented what would \nhappen to their rate and payment, rather than what could happen. For example, at least two thought that in 2012 \nand 2014 their rate and payment would increase to the amount shown in those columns of the table, and did not \nunderstand that their rates and payments might actually be lower than those shown.\n\n. When asked whether the initial or maximum payment would be more important to them when considering an \nadjustable-rate loan, eight of the ten participants indicated that the maximum payment would be more important.\n\n. Underneath the Payment Summary table, both versions of the TILA statement used in this round included some \nexplanatory text. Version E included an additional sentence that did not appear on version F: \"If the market rate \ndoes not change, at the end of this period your interest rate will increase by 2.00%, adding approximately $ 250.00 \nto your monthly payment.\" The inclusion of this statement did not have any noticeable effect on participant \nunderstanding.\n\n . Almost all participants understood that the interest rate would change based on the \"market rate\" (the term used \nin the statement). When asked to explain what is meant by the \"market rate,\" participants gave a variety of \nanswers, including the stock market, the price of homes in a community, and \"how the economy is doing.\" One \nparticipant understood the term \"LIBOR.\"\n\n. Most participants had difficulty connecting the rates shown in the payment table with the information about \nperiodic and lifetime caps below the table. In fact, for a few participants the presence of this explanatory text \nseemed to decrease comprehension of the table; these participants initially understood what was shown in the \ntable, but then became confused when reading the text.\n\n\n\n. Almost all participants understood the information provided under the heading \"Total Payments,\" including the \nnumber of payments, total of payments, and finance charge. When asked how they would use this information, \nmost participants indicated that they would not.\n\n. No participants commented on the footnote providing the prepaid finance charge during their first reading of the \nform. When the interviewer pointed out this footnote and asked participants to explain what the \"prepaid finance \ncharges\" signified, none were able to do so.\n\nTaxes and Insurance (Escrow)\n\n. All but one participant indicated they had heard the term \"escrow\" previously. Most seemed to have a thorough \nunderstanding of the term before reading the form.\n\n. All participants understood the amount they would pay for taxes and insurance could change over time. However, \nthree participants did not realize that the amount shown in the table was estimated, and would not necessarily be \naccurate when they closed on the mortgage.\n\n. All but two participants assumed that the \"insurance\" referred to in the payment table was homeowner's insurance. \nOne thought this figure might include private mortgage insurance (PMI), while another thought it could include other \ntypes of insurance but did not specify which kinds.\n\nKey Questions Section\n\n. Eight of ten participants understood from the Key Questions section that the lender could demand repayment of \nthe loan at any time. However, two of the eight mistakenly thought that the lender could only do so if they became \ndelinquent.\n\n. Half of the participants misunderstood the question related to equity-sharing. Several were confused by the last \nsentence of this section (\"In exchange, we are giving you a lower interest rate\") and mistakenly thought the form \nwas indicating they would receive a lower interest rate at the point when they sold their home. Regardless of \nwhether they fully understood the information provided, all participants stated that an equity-sharing feature would \nbe a negative feature for the borrower.\n\n . Version F showed eight key questions in this section, each with an answer of \"Yes\" or \"No.\" Version E only \nshowed those questions whose answers reflected risky features of the loan, and then provided a concise statement \nlisting other features not present in the loan terms. All but two participants indicated they preferred to be shown all \neight key questions, even when the answer showed that a given feature did not apply to the loan. Two participants \npreferred to be shown only those questions whose answers implied risk.\n\n. Version E included \"interest-only payments\" in a list of features that did not apply to the loan, while version F listed \nthe question \"Will my monthly payments reduce my loan balance?\" and indicated that the answer was \"Yes.\" In \nboth forms, the intent was to indicate that this loan did not include interest-only payments. However, participants' \ncomprehension of this fact was slightly higher when viewing version F.\n\n. A few participants commented they did not like the fact that the answers to the Key Questions related to rate and \npayment change were simply \"Yes.\" They indicated that more explanation should be provided to help borrowers \nunderstand their loan more completely.\n\nCredit Life insurance\n\n. Almost all participants were somewhat familiar with credit life insurance before seeing the form; only one indicated \nthat he had never heard of this feature before.\n\n\n\n. Almost all interview participants understood from their reading of this section of the form that credit life insurance is \nnot required. All understood that this insurance would have a monthly cost associated with it and that this cost was \nnot included in the monthly payments shown elsewhere on the form.\n\n. After reading this section of the form, several participants commented that credit life insurance sounded like an \nimportant loan feature and indicated that they would want to enroll.\n\nMortgage Shopping Simulation\n\nParticipants were asked to review two TILA statements that described different 3/1 ARMs. Loan 1 had a higher \ninterest rate and monthly payment, while Loan 2 had higher settlement charges and a slightly higher APR. \nParticipants were asked to select one of the loans and provide reasons for why they chose it.\n\n. Eight of the ten participants selected Loan 2 (i.e., TILA version E2 or F2). These participants generally realized the \nloan had higher settlement charges, but felt that the lower interest rate and monthly payments outweighed the \nhigher up-front costs.\n\n. Two participants selected Loan 1 (version El or F1). They did so primarily because of its lower settlement charges, \nalthough one also considered the APR (see below).\n\n . Only one person considered the APR when choosing between the two loans. This participant chose F1, because \nit had a lower \"Overall Rate of Fees + Interest\" (APR) and lower settlement charges. When other participants were \nasked why they had not used the APR, most indicated they did not understand what the term meant.\n\n. When asked if the length of time they planned to hold the loan (3 vs. 30 years) would make a difference in which \nloan they selected, just over half indicated that it would not. Four participants, however, indicated that the first loan \nwould be the better choice over 3 years while the second loan would be preferable over 30 years. Their reasoning \nwas that over a longer period of time it made sense to pay a larger up-front charge in exchange for a lower interest \nrate, which was what the second loan offered.\n\nAlternative APR Presentations\n\n. As part of the interview, each individual was shown two alternative presentations of the APR that provided context \nfor how the loan compared to others in the market. One version included a graphic that placed the APR on a scale, \nalong with a line distinguishing \"prime\" and \"subprime\" loans. The second version did not include a graphic, but \nincluded text that listed both the cut-off between \"prime\" and \"subprime\" loans and the average APR received by \npeople with \"excellent credit.\"\n\n. When looking at either the graphic or text-based versions, participants generally understood that a lower APR was \nbetter for them and that people with better credit would be offered loans with a lower APR. However, it was not \nclear to what extent this understanding was based on the material presented to them or on prior knowledge.\n\n. Both versions used the word \"subprime\" in their descriptions. While almost all thought the word had a negative \nconnotation and indicated they would not want a \"subprime loan,\" several did not understanding the meaning of this \nterm.\n\n. In general, participants found the text-based presentation of the APR easier to understand. The primary reason for \nthis was that the text-based presentation listed the average APR received by people with excellent credit, while the \ngraphic presentation did not.\n\n. A few participants suggested the graphic and text be used in combination to explain the information more fully.\n\nOther Required Disclosure Text\n\n\n\n. All or almost all participants understood the disclosure text related to possible lender actions, property insurance, \nrefunds of interest and fees, and late payment fees.\n\n. As in previous rounds, several participants had difficulty understanding the text about loan assumption. In some \ncases this confusion was due to the fact that the phrase \"take over your mortgage\" was seen as threatening or a \nnegative feature of the loan.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. Some participants in this round of testing were confused as to whether the amount shown for \"settlement \ncharges\" included their down payment, so a statement was added to the TILA statement indicating that the down \npayment was not included in the settlement charges.\n\n. Most participants did not understand after reading the forms that a portion of the loan amount would go toward \nsettlement charges. Therefore, the forms developed for the next round more explicitly broke the loan amount into \ntwo portions: the amount applied toward fees and the amount available for the borrower's own use.\n\nAPR\n\n. Neither of the labels used for the APR (\"True Cost Factor\" and \"Overall Rate of Fees and Interest\") led to \nimproved comprehension of the term. As a result, forms used in subsequent testing used the original label \"Annual \nPercentage Rate\" for this term. Rather than varying the label used, the form designers focused on improving the \npresentation this term.\n\n. Displaying the APR without a percentage sign had no discernable effect on consumer understanding, so the \npercentage sign was used in subsequent versions of the TILA statement.\n\n. Participants in Dallas generally reacted positively to the new alternative presentations of the APR they were \nshown. Therefore, the forms used in the following round of testing included both text-based and graphic context for \nhow the APR compared to that of other loans.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\n. Some participants in this and previous rounds had difficulty relating the rate caps to the maximum rates shown in \nthe payment table. Therefore, one of the versions designed for the next round (version G1) included text that \nexplicitly connected the lifetime cap to the maximum interest rate.\n\nKey Questions Section\n\n. Most participants in this round preferred to have all Key Questions shown, even those to which the answer was \n\"No.\" However, ICF Macro and Board staff were concerned that listing all eight Key Questions might not be an \nefficient use of space, since affirmative answers to some of the questions (such as that related to a demand \nfeature) would be rare. Therefore, the decision was made to require that Key Questions related to rate and payment \nchanges, pre-payment penalties, interest-only payments and balloon payments would be required on the form, \nwhether the answer to the question was affirmative or negative. Key Questions related to negative amortization, \nequity-sharing, and a demand feature would only be required if the answer was affirmative. This policy was \nimplemented in all forms designed for subsequent rounds of testing.\n\n . Due to continued lack of participant understanding of the Key Question related to interest-only payments, the \nwording of this question was revised slightly on forms for the following round.\n\n\n\n. Because some participants commented they did not like the fact that the responses for the first two Key Questions \nstated simply \"Yes\" with no explanation, in subsequent forms a short explanation accompanied all affirmative \nanswers.\n\nCredit Life Insurance\n\n. Based on the findings from this round, the Board staff was concerned that the presence of information about credit \nlife insurance on the first page of the TILA statement increased awareness of the product, but did not make \nconsumers aware that they might not qualify for the product's benefits. Therefore, the decision was made to remove \nthis information from the TILA statement and to add language to alert consumers that they might not be eligible for \nbenefits from the insurance.\n\nOther Required Disclosure Text\n\n. Because participants had difficulty understanding the disclosure text describing loan assumption, this text was \nrevised and tested again in the next round of interviews.\n\nROUND 11: PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND (MARCH/APRIL 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nOn March 30 and April 1, 2009, ICF Macro conducted 10 cognitive interviews in Providence, RI. Unlike previous \nrounds of interviews, which focused primarily on hybrid ARMs, the TILA statements tested in this round described \nmore complex mortgage products. Loan G was an interest-only 5/1 ARM that included PMI. Loan H was a 3-year \nfixed-rate mortgage with a balloon payment. Loan H also had an equity-sharing feature, which was disclosed in the \nKey Questions section. Loan G had a subprime APR, while Loan H had an APR just under the cutoff for subprime. \nTwo different versions of the TILA statement were developed and tested for each of these two loan products.\n\nTo avoid having the statements appear cramped or dense, forms for this round were laid out on two letter-sized \npages rather than one legal-sized page. The \"Key Questions\" section was moved to the second page, as was some \ndescriptive text about rate and payment changes (under the heading \"More Information About Your Payments\").\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Participants in the interviews were first asked to review one of the TILA statements that described an interest-only \nARM product (version G1 or G2). They were then asked a series of questions designed to test their comprehension \nof the content on the form.\n\n. Next, participants were given a TILA statement that described the second loan product (version H1 or H2). They \nwere asked to review this loan and asked several questions about its content.\n\n. After reviewing the TILA statements, participants were asked to review some additional text for required \ndisclosures about assumption, negative amortization, and reduced documentation loans.\n\nFor the Providence round of testing and all subsequent rounds, the footnote for prepaid finance charges was \ndeleted. Instead, the amount financed was shown under the heading \"Total Payments,\" in the \"More Information \nabout Your Payments\" section on the second page of the statement.\n\nFive forms were used in these sections of the interview; all are provided in Appendix D:\n\n. TILA statements G1 and G2 (both have the same terms, but a different format);\n\n. TILA statements H1 and H2 (both have the same terms, but a different format); and\n\n. A separate page with additional text for required disclosures.\n\n\n\nKey Interview Findings\n\nLoan Obligation (Loan G)\n\n. All but one participant understood that when they received this form they would not be obligated to accept it. As in \nprevious rounds, this understanding was based more on prior knowledge than on the fact it was stated on the form.\n\n. Three participants incorrectly believed that by signing the TILA statement they would be committing themselves to \nthe loan. Another participant commented that even thought the form specifically states that a signature only \nindicates receipt of the form, the cautionary language above the signature line makes it appear binding.\n\nLoan Summary Section (Loan G)\n\n. All participants correctly identified the term of the loan (30 years) and the amount borrowed.\n\n. When asked if they could identify how much of the $ 200,000 loan they could apply to the price of the home they \nwere purchasing, about half of participants correctly indicated that $ 198,000 would go toward the home purchase. \nThe remaining participants were not able to answer this question correctly.\n\n. Only three participants understood that the $ 2,000 that had been rolled into the loan amount for Loan G was \nincluded in the amount shown for Total Settlement Charges. Others thought this $ 2,000 would be an additional \ncharge or were not sure.\n\n. Almost all participants understood from the form the down payment was not included in settlement charges.\n\nAPR (Loans G and H)\n\n. Several participants initially confused the APR with their interest rate. When asked to explain the difference \nbetween the interest rate and APR, only two participants were able to explain that the APR included settlement \ncharges--even though the APR was described on the page as \"Your interest rate with settlement charges included.\"\n\n. Despite the fact that participants did not generally understand what the APR was, most realized from the graphic \nthat the APR for Loan G fell in the \"subprime\" category, and that this meant their loan was more costly than a prime \nloan. These participants indicated this made them feel more negatively about the loan.\n\n. All participants were shown Loan H and asked how they would react to the loan if they had excellent credit. \nAbout half indicated that if they had excellent credit they would expect to get a lower APR closer to the average \nprime offer rate (APOR). The other half did not seem concerned that their APR was different from the APOR, and \ndid not indicate that this fact would affect their decision whether to accept the loan\n\n . Five participants were asked to explain the graphic on Version G-1 or H-1--in particular, the significance of the \ntwo dotted lines on the graph. Four of the five participants understood that one dotted line represented the APOR, \nwhile the other represented the lower end of the range labeled \"subprime.\" Two of the five, however, thought the \ngraphic divided the range of possible APRs into three categories--one for people with excellent credit (below the \nAPOR), one for people with \"average\" credit (between the APOR and \"subprime\" cutoff), and one for people with \npoor credit (the area labeled \"subprime\"). This was not the intent of the graphic, since this interpretation \nmisrepresents the significance of the APOR.\n\n. Although the word \"subprime\" had a negative connotation for them, only a few participants understood that a \nsubprime loan was a higher-priced loan usually G1ven to borrowers with poor credit. Two participants thought the \nterm \"subprime\" meant the loan had a rate lower than the prime rate.\n\n. The APR graphic in versions G1 and H1 was slightly different than that on versions G2 and H2. In G1 and H1, the \nAPOR was represented by a dotted line, while the APR for the loan being described was represented by a \n\n\n\ndiamond. In G2 and H2, the APOR was represented by a star, and the loan being described was represented by an \ninverted triangle and labeled \"this loan.\" About three quarters of participants indicated they preferred the latter \nformat. Some commented that a star was an appropriate symbol for the APOR, since it represented a very good \nrate.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\nUnderstanding of Adjustable Rate (Loan G)\n\n. When asked to identify the initial interest rate of the loans, several participants mistakenly pointed to the APR. \nThis seemed to be largely due to the prominence of this figure on the form.\n\n. All participants understood the rate would change, and all but one understood that the first rate adjustment would \noccur after 5 years (2014). However, most did not realize their initial rate was discounted.\n\n. Only three of the ten participants understood that the rate would change annually after the first 5 years.\n\n. When participants were asked what determined how the rate would change over time, three participants \nunderstood the rate was based on an index. Most other participants indicated the rate change was based on the \n\"market rate\" or the \"national rate.\"\n\nPayment Summary Table (Loan G)\n\n. The maximum interest rate was correctly identified by eight of ten participants. Four of five participants who saw \nversion G1 understood that the interest rate could increase no more than 2 percentage points each year. 28. All \nparticipants were able to identify the amount of the first monthly payment and all knew the payment would be same \nfor the first 5 years.\n\n. When asked what was more important to them in terms of the payments, six participants indicated the \"maximum \never\" payment was more important than the initial or first adjustment payments.\n\n. As in previous rounds, several participants were unsure what would happen to their payment after the introductory \nperiod ended. Some assumed the payment would definitely increase to the amount shown in the \"maximum at first \nadjustment\" column, while others understood that their payment could be lower than that shown.\n\nInterest-Only Payments (Loan G)\n\n. Only two of the ten participants realized during their first review of Loan G that their payments would be interest-\nonly during the first 5 years. All participants eventually understood this feature of the loan, but in most cases only \nafter being prompted by the interviewer to re-read portions of the form.\n\nTaxes and Insurance (Escrow) (Loans G and H)\n\n28 \n\nForm G2 did not include information about the periodic cap on rate change.\n\n \n\n\n\n. On versions G1 and G2, only one participant thought the amount for taxes and insurance shown in the payment \nsummary table was the actual amount he would pay; all others understood this figure was an estimate. Almost all \nparticipants also understood that taxes and insurance could change over time.\n\n. Almost all participants understood Loan H did not include an escrow account and that as a result they would have \nto pay taxes and insurance on their own. In all cases, this understanding was based on the inclusion of the words \n\"not included\" in the escrow row of the Payment Summary table; fewer participants noticed this information in the \nMore Information About Your Payments section.\n\nKey Questions Section (Loans G and H)\n\n. All participants understood that Loan G included a prepayment penalty if they paid off the loan within the first 2 \nyears.\n\n. When asked to read the Key Question related to interest-only payments, almost all participants understood they \nwould not be paying any principal for the first 5 years they made payments. All  realized that this could be a risky \nfeature, although one participant commented he might still accept an interest-only loan if that were the only type he \ncould afford.\n\n. When looking at Loan H, only three of ten participants noticed the equity-sharing feature in their first review of the \nform. Four others eventually saw this information in the Key Questions section, while three never did.\n\n\"More Information About Your Payments\" Section (Loan G)\n\n. All participants had heard of PMI previously. However, only two of the ten participants noticed the text under the \nheading Escrow that indicated that they would be paying PMI with this loan.\n\n. Version G1 included information about periodic and lifetime rate change caps, while version G2 did not. \nParticipants who saw G1 showed a greater understanding of how their rate could change over time. For example, \nsome participants who saw G1 were able to use the periodic rate change cap information to determine what their \nmaximum rate would be in 2015, while no participants who saw G2 were able to correctly answer this question. \nWhen asked whether information about rate caps would be important to them and should be included on the form, \nmost participants responded affirmatively.\n\n. Almost all participants correctly identified the number of payments and total of payments, as well as the amount \nthat would go to interest and fees. As in previous rounds, none were able to explain what was meant by the \n\"amount financed,\" although this did not affect their comprehension of other parts of the form.\n\nBalloon Payment (Loan H)\n\n. Almost all participants realized in their initial review of Loan H that it included a balloon payment. All understood \nthat the \"balloon payment\" was a large payment that they would have to make after 3 years.\n\n. Most noticed the information about the balloon payment in the Payment Summary table. Only one noticed it first in \nthe Key Questions section.\n\n. Versions H1 and H2 provided information about the balloon payment in two different ways. H1 showed the \nballoon payment in a separate column in the Payment Summary table, while H2 showed the balloon payment in a \nseparate row below the table. The format that was used did not have a discernable effect on participant \nunderstanding; almost all participants noticed the balloon payment regardless of which form they saw. Participants \nwere evenly split in terms of which of the two formats they felt was the clearest presentation of the balloon payment.\n\nOther Required Disclosure Text\n\n\n\n. At the end of the interview, participants were asked to review three different disclosures and describe what they \nmeant in their own words. The first disclosure was revised text related to loan assumption. The results were more \npositive than in previous rounds; most participants understood what was meant by the fact that the lender could \n\"permit the new buyer to take over the payments\" on their mortgage and that this could be a positive feature for a \nborrower.\n\n. In addition to the language about loan assumptions, participants were also asked to review two disclosures in the \n\"Q&A\" format used in the \"Key Questions About Risk\" section of the TILA. The first described negative amortization \nby indicating that the loan balance for the loan could increase over time, even if the borrower made payments. All \nstated that this was not a feature that they would want on their loan. While few participants had previously heard the \nphrase \"negative amortization,\" almost all understood that if this disclosure were true they could potentially end up \nowing more money than they had oriG1nally borrowed.\n\n. The other \"Key Question\" disclosure participants were asked to review described no- or low-documentation loans. \nIt indicated that the loan had a higher rate or fees because the borrower did not document his or her employment, \nincome, or other assets. While several were surprised at the disclosure because they assumed that documentation \nalways had to be provided, almost all understood its meaning.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. Although the breakout of the loan amount into two amounts--the amount applied towards fees and the amount \navailable for the borrower's own use--was more successful than previous attempts to communicate information, \nalmost half of the participants were still confused by this portion of the form. As a result, this reference was removed \nfrom the Loan Amount section. Instead, underneath the settlement charges a reference was added referring to what \nportion of the fees were included in the loan amount.\n\nAPR\n\n. Two different versions of the APR graphic were tested in Providence. Generally, participants reacted more \npositively to the graphic used in versions G2/H2, which included more explicit labels for the APOR and the APR of \nthe loan offered. As a result, this basic graphic template was used in forms for subsequent rounds of testing.\n\n. Several participants were confused by the word \"subprime\" as it was used in the APR section, so this word was \nnot used in forms for the next round. Instead, the \"subprime\" portion of the APR range in the graphic was labeled \n\"high cost.\"\n\n. Several participants in Providence and previous rounds of testing expressed a belief that a small difference in APR \nwould not likely make a significant difference in their monthly payment. To combat this misconception, a reference \nwas added to forms for the following  round (Denver) that indicated the monthly dollar amount a 1 percent decrease \nin APR could save a borrower.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\n. Because participants continued to struggle to understand what would happen to their payment at the end of the \nintroductory period, for the next round of testing information was added to the first page of the form describing what \nwould happen if market rates did not change. This text appeared as a \"Teaser Rate Notice\" under the payment \nsummary table.\n\n\n\n. Most participants did not notice the disclosure in the \"More Information about Your Payments\" section that \nindicated their loan included private mortgage insurance. Therefore, the forms for the next round of testing included \nthis information in the heading of the escrow row in the Payment Summary Table on the first page.\n\n. Because most participants did not initially realize that payments for Loan G would be interest-only for the first 5 \nyears, in the next round a reference to \"interest-only payments\" was added under Loan Type to make this feature \nmore prominent.\n\n. In the model forms and clauses it releases in July 2009, the Board will propose that in most cases the balloon \npayments be displayed in a separate row at the bottom of the payment table (as in version H2). Since participants \nhad no clear preference between the different formats tested, the rationale for this decision was that it may be \neasier to add a row to the payment table rather than a column since space is more likely to be limited horizontally \non a page.\n\nKey Questions Section\n\n. In an attempt to improve comprehension among participants, the wording of the affirmative answer to the Key \nQuestion related to interest-only payments was revised slightly on forms for the following round.\n\n. Several participants did not understand that interest rate adjustments for the sample loan could occur on an \nannual basis, so a reference to the frequency of adjustment was added to the answer to the first Key Question \n(\"Can my interest rate change?\").\n\nROUND 12: DENVER, COLORADO (APRIL 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nIn April 2009, ICF Macro conducted 10 cognitive interviews in Denver, CO. The TILA statements tested in this \nround described two different mortgage products: an interest-only ARM and a payment option ARM. The goal of the \ninterviews was to assess how clearly the revised statement described the terms of these more complex products.\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Participants in the interviews were first asked to review one of two TILA statements that described an interest-only \nARM (versions J-IO or K-IO). As in previous rounds, they were then asked a series of questions designed to test \ntheir comprehension of the content on the form.\n\n. Next, participants were G1ven the alternate interest-only TILA statement, which varied only in the way in which \nAPR information was presented on the form. Participants were asked to compare the APR sections on the two \nforms and indicate which format they felt was clearer and more informative. In order to minimize learning effects, \nthe order in which participants were shown the two interest-only TILA statements was rotated between participants.\n\n. Participants were then shown a TILA statement that described a payment option ARM product (versions J-PO or \nK-PO). Again, participants were then asked a series of questions designed to test their comprehension of the \ncontent on the form. They were subsequently shown the alternate payment option TILA statement and asked \nwhich aspects of each form they found clearer. As with the interest-only loans, the order in which the participants \nwere shown the two payment option TILA statements was rotated.\n\n. After reviewing the TILA statements, participants were shown some additional text related to credit life insurance \nand were asked questions to test their understanding of the content.\n\nFive forms were used in these sections of the interview; all are provided in Appendix D:\n\n. TILA statements J-IO and K-IO, which described interest-only ARM products (identical except for the format of the \nAPR section);\n\n\n\n. TILA statements J-PO and K-PO, which described payment option ARM products (identical except for the format \nof the APR and Payment Summary sections); and\n\n. A page with an additional disclosure about credit life insurance.\n\nVersions J-IO and K-IO displayed an APR of 7.59%, which fell into the \"high cost\" (i.e., subprime) area shown on \nthe form. Versions J-PO and K-PO displayed an APR of 6.01%, which was close to, but not in, the high cost range \nshown on the form.\n\n Prior to this round, ICF Macro and Board staff determined that the Payment Summary table tested in prior rounds \nwould not be appropriate to use for a payment option ARM. Because payment option ARMs are significantly \ndifferent products, the table being used for other types of loans would not have disclosed several important pieces \nof information, such as the fact that multiple payment options were available each month. Therefore, versions J-PO \nand K-PO include a new Payment Summary section that was customized for this specific type of product. Because \nof the complexity of payment option ARMs, ICF Macro did not attempt to describe all details of the loan product. For \nexample, the TILA statement that was developed did not display all payment options available for this type of loan; \nit only provided information about the full and minimum payments. The primary goals of the statement were to \ncommunicate to consumers that: a) making the minimum payment each month would cause their loan balance to \nincrease; and b) their minimum required payment could increase dramatically in the future.\n\nKey In Findings\n\nLoan Summary Section 29. All participants correctly identified the term of the loan (30 years). All but two correctly \nidentified the amount that was being borrowed; the remaining two incorrectly thought they were borrowing the \n\"amount financed\" shown on the second page of the form.\n\n. Almost all participants understood that the settlement charges shown on the form did not include any down \npayment they would owe.\n\n. TILA statements used in Denver indicated that $ 2,000 of the settlement charges had been \"rolled into\" the loan \namount. All five participants who were shown these forms were confused when this language was pointed out to \nthem; most thought this meant the loan amount would be different than the amount shown ($ 200,000). On the \nsecond day of testing, participants were shown an alternative wording for this portion of the disclosure (\"$ 2,000 of \nthese charges is already included in your loan amount above\"). Participants found this phrasing much clearer; all \nunderstood that the $ 2,000 was part of the $ 200,000 loan amount shown on the form.\n\nAPR\n\n. As in previous rounds, participants continued to confuse the APR with their interest rate; several, in fact, referred \nto the APR as the interest rate during their initial review of the form. When participants were asked to explain why \nthe APR and interest rate listed on the form were different, only two correctly indicated that the APR includes \nsettlement charges. All others were either unable to explain the difference or provided an incorrect explanation; two, \nfor example, thought the APR was the average of the interest rates they would be charged over time.\n\n29 \n\nParticipants answered questions about the loan term and settlement charges while reviewing the interest-only loan.\n\n \n\n\n\n . The forms used in this round included a graphic that that showed a range of possible APRs. The APOR was \nidentified on this range, and labeled the \"Avg. Best APR.\" The range of subprime APRs was shaded darker on the \nscale, and was labeled \"high cost.\" All participants were able to correctly explain what the \"Avg. Best APR\" and \nshaded regions meant. Most also understood that participants with poor credit were likely to be offered loans with \nAPRs that were identified as \"high cost.\"\n\n. The APR for the interest-only loan used in this round was 7.59%, which placed it in the range labeled \"high cost.\" \nMost participants realized that the APR fell into the \"high cost\" category based on their review of the graphic. \nHowever, not all indicated this would be a factor in whether or not they accepted the loan. For example, some who \nconfused the APR with the interest rate said that 7.59% seemed like a good interest rate to them, because it was \nlower than what they had on their current mortgage. Others commented that they would not accept the loan, \nbecause their current interest rate was lower than 7.59%. These participants were clearly relating the APR shown \non the form to their own personal experience, rather than the context provided by the form.\n\n. Six of the ten participants indicated they would be less likely to accept the interest-only loan based on the \ninformation in the APR section, while the remaining four indicated this information would be unlikely to affect their \ndecision. However, in some cases it was clear that participants' attitudes toward the loan were being driven by \nfactors other than the APR, such as the fact that it had an adjustable rate or that payments were interest-only.\n\n. The TILA statements describing a payment option loan displayed an APR of 6.01%, which was just below the \nboundary of \"high cost\" loans. Again, most participants understood the content of the APR section--for example, \nthey knew that the average APR offered to borrowers with excellent credit was 4.75%. However, when asked what \nthey would do if they had excellent credit and received this form from their lender, half expressed concern that their \nAPR was too high. These participants indicated that they would go to another lender to get another offer, or would \nask their lender to G1ve them a lower APR. Others, however, did not seem to be bothered by the fact that they had \nnot been offered the lower APR and indicated that the information on the form would not influence their decision \nwhether to accept the loan.\n\n. All forms also included a statement informing readers that a 1% APR reduction would result in a savings of $ 167 \na month for the first 5 years. Most participants did not notice this information; when asked if the form contained any \ninformation about how much money they would save with a lower APR, only two participants referenced this \nstatement on the form.\n\n. When participants were asked to compare the APR sections of versions J and K, six participants indicated that \nthey preferred version K, while only one preferred version J. The remaining three participants did not express a \npreference. The aspects that participants liked about version K included the fact that the APR was displayed in a \nlarger font, the fact that the explanatory text was below the graphic rather than beside it, and the fact that the \ndefinition of the APR was provided right next to the actual term, rather than in smaller font below.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\nInterest-Only ARM\n\n. All interview participants correctly identified the initial and maximum interest rates, as well as the period of time \nduring which the rate would remain fixed.\n\n. All but one participant indicated their rate and payment would likely increase at the end of the first 5 years. \nHowever, their responses seemed to be based mostly on a distrust of ARMs and an assumption that rates on these \nloans usually increase. Only two participants referenced the information in the Teaser Rate Notice; they indicated \nthe rate would likely increase because it was discounted for the introductory period.\n\n. Only three participants understood how often the interest rate could change after the first 5 years; the remainder \ndid not see that information in the Key Questions or More Information About Your Payments sections.\n\n\n\n. About half of participants were able to identify the maximum their rate could increase in a single year (2%); the \nremainder did not see this information in the More Information About Your Payments section.\n\n. All participants correctly identified the initial monthly payment, and all but two understood that this payment would \nremain constant for 5 years (except for potential changes in escrow).\n\n. Almost all participants could identify the maximum their payment would be when it first adjusted after 5 years. \nHowever, some participants mistakenly thought their payment would definitely increase to the maximum at that \ntime. This misconception appeared to be in part because of a misreading of the table and in part because of \ngeneral distrust of ARM products.\n\n. When the Teaser Rate Notice was pointed out to them, a few participants reacted negatively to the use of the \nword \"teaser.\" Some commented that lenders would be very unlikely to use this word when communicating with \nconsumers; others felt the use of the word was demeaning or insulting.\n\n. Only six of the participants realized during their initial review of the form that the loan included interest-only \npayments; the remaining four did not.\n\n. In some cases, participants were not concerned to find out that payments for the first 5 years were interest-only. \nThey seemed to think this was a traditional loan in which the amount of principal paid during the first few years is \nvery small. Because of this misunderstanding, these participants indicated that the fact that initial payments were \ninterest-only would not affect how they felt about the loan.\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n. Two participants had previously heard of a payment option mortgage; one of the two had held this type of \nmortgage previously.\n\n. After their first review of the TILA statement, about half of participants commented they definitely would not accept \nthis type of loan. Two others indicated they found the terms of the loan confusing.\n\n. All participants understood the interest rate could change and all but two understood it could beG1n chanG1ng \nafter the first month.\n\n. Half of the participants were able to identify the initial interest rate of the loan (1.5%). Four of the other five \nparticipants incorrectly referenced the APR when asked this question. Participants who saw version K were more \nsuccessful in identifying the initial rate because it was displayed in the Payment Summary table rather than in the \nexplanatory text above the table.\n\n. All but two participants were able to identify the maximum interest rate for the loan (10.5%).\n\n. All but one participant understood that their minimum payment would increase over time, and increase \ndramatically in June 2011.\n\n. Most participants understood based on their first review of the form that if they made only the minimum payment \neach month, their loan balance would increase because of unpaid interest.\n\n. The Payment Summary tables were significantly different on versions J-PO and K-PO. Participants were shown \nboth forms and asked which version of the table they found clearer and more informative. Most participants \nindicated that they preferred the table on version K to that on version J. The most frequent reasons G1ven by \nparticipants were that they liked the fact the column headings identified specific points in time (rather than \"Year 1,\" \n\"Year 2,\" etc.); they liked the fact that the table in version K listed the interest rate at different points in time as well \nas the payment; they liked the references to \"1st adjustment\" and \"2nd adjustment\" that were provided; and they \nliked the placement of the description of the full and minimum payment options.\n\nTaxes and Insurance (Escrow)\n\n\n\nInterest-Only ARM\n\n. All but two participants were able to explain the term \"escrow.\" Of the other two, one said that they had heard of \nthe word but did not know what it meant, while the other had never heard the term.\n\n. Seven participants understood that the amounts shown for taxes and insurance on the form were only estimates. \nEight understood that these amounts could change over time.\n\n. Half of the participants had previously heard of PMI; the remainder had not.\n\n. Although the Payment Table listed PMI as part of the estimated taxes and insurance, only six of the ten \nparticipants realized they would be paying PMI on this loan. One reason that awareness was fairly low may have \nbeen that half of the participants had never heard of PMI before.\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n. When reviewing the payment option ARM, half of the participants saw the reference that taxes and insurance were \nincluded in the payments shown in the Payment Summary section. The remaining participants indicated that taxes \nand insurance were not included or stated they did not know.\n\nKey Questions Section\n\nInterest-Only ARM\n\n. All participants understood that the interest-only loan they were shown had a prepayment penalty.\n\n. When directed to read the Key Question about interest-only payments, most participants understood that \npayments for the first 5 years would not cover any principal, and that they would begin paying down the loan \nprincipal in year 6.\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n. When reviewing the payment option forms, most participants generally understood the content of the Key \nQuestions related to interest-only payments and negative amortization. However, a few confused the information \nthat was provided about interest-only payments and negative amortization, and mistakenly thought that the \ninformation in the Key Question about interest-only payments related to the minimum payment option.\n\n\"More Information About Your Payments\" Section\n\nInterest-Only ARM\n\n. When asked to read the text under the Rate Calculation heading, about half of the participants were able to \nexplain how their rate would be determined after the introductory period. Some participants were confused by the \nterm \"LIBOR,\" while others had difficulty understanding the concept of how an index and margin would be used to \ncalculate their rate.\n\n. When asked to read the text under the Rate Change Limits and Total Payments headings, all participants \ngenerally understood the information provided. However, several participants did not notice this information until \nthey were specifically asked to read it (e.g., the periodic rate cap).\n\n\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n. Most participants did not understand the information under the heading Rate and Payment Change Limits in the \nMore Information About Your Payments section of the form. Two participants seemed to generally understand the \ninformation about the caps on payments and the loan balance, although the extent to which they understood exactly \nhow the caps worked was unclear. Other participants were clearly confused by this text.\n\nLoan Obligation\n\n. Despite the fact the forms included a statement consumers were not obligated to accept the loan in addition to a \nstatement \"By signing below, I acknowledge receipt of this form,\" about half of the participants mistakenly thought if \nthey signed the statement they would be indicating acceptance of the loan terms.\n\nCredit Life Insurance\n\n. All participants understood after reading the text that there was an additional cost for credit life insurance.\n\n. When asked whether they would sign up for credit life insurance based on the notice they were shown, three \nindicated that they would. Two said that they would consult their own life insurance policies first to see whether \nadditional coverage was necessary. The remaining participants were unsure whether they would sign up.\n\n. Only three participants noticed the language that indicated even if you pay for credit life insurance, you may not \nreceive any benefit from the policy.\n\n. All interview participants noticed the reference to the Board website in the credit life statement. Most indicated that \nthey would be likely to visit this site if they had questions about this product.\n\n. Although most participants also saw the reference to a housing counselor, only four indicated they would be likely \nto contact a counselor to obtain more information. Others said they would be more likely to go to the website \nshown.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. As in the previous round, some participants were unsure how often their rate and payment could change after the \nintroductory period ended. Therefore, the forms developed for the following round of testing included the adjustment \nfrequency in the Loan Type section.\n\n. Because the alternate language used on the second day describing settlement charges that were included in the \nloan amount was clearer to participants, this language was used on forms for the following round of testing.\n\n. Because some participants continued to confuse the APR with their interest rate, forms for the next round did not \ndescribe the APR as \"your interest rate with settlement charges included.\" Instead, the revised forms used the \nphrase \"overall cost of this loan\" or \"fee-inclusive cost of this loan.\"\n\n. Although participants understood that the right side of the APR range represented \"high cost\" loans, some \nparticipants in this round did not express concern that their APR fell into this range. Therefore, the graphic used in \nforms for the subsequent round of testing in Bethesda attempted to demonstrate the importance of this range by \ncoloring it black and labeling it the \"high cost zone.\" Also, an explanatory note about \"high cost\" loans that had been \nremoved from forms in this round was added back in, along with a reference that loans falling in this range are \nusually provided to consumers with poor credit.\n\n\n\n. Most participants preferred the format of the APR section shown in version K to that of version J, therefore, this \nformat was used in all subsequent forms.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\n. The Teaser Rate Notice was simplified in forms for the next round of testing, because of concerns that the number \nof different rates and payments displayed on the first page could confuse consumers. Specifically, the amount of \nthe rate increase and the reference to a new monthly payment amount were removed.\n\n. A few participants reacted negatively to the use of the word \"teaser,\" so on subsequent forms the Teaser Rate \nNotice was renamed the Introductory Rate Notice.\n\n. Some participants continued not to notice that their loan included PMI, so a bullet was used to emphasize this fact \nin the left-hand column of the Payment Summary table. In addition, information about private mortgage insurance \nwas given its own heading in the More Information About Your Payments section on the second page.\n\nInterest-Only Payments\n\n. Several participants in this round of testing did not realize they would be paying only interest during the \nintroductory period, while some others did not realize that the fact that payments were interest-only made this \nproduct different than traditional loans. To emphasize that payments were interest-only, the number \"0\" in the first \ncolumn of the Payment Summary table was replaced with the word \"None.\"\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n. When reviewing forms for the payment option loan, participants strongly preferred all aspects of the Payment \nSummary table used in version K to that used in version J. Therefore, this format was used in the forms designed \nfor the next round of testing.\n\n. Because some participants confused the interest-only payments described in the Key Questions section with the \nminimum payment, the description of the minimum payment option was revised slightly for the next round of testing. \nThe revised text was adapted from the payment option monthly payment disclosure that was also tested this round \n(see Chapter VI).\n\n. Several participants did not realize escrow payments were included in the sample monthly payments shown in the \nPayment Summary table, so this fact was made more prominent in the forms tested in the following round.\n\n. Most participants struggled to understand the information in the \"More Information about Your Payments\" section \nunder the heading \"Rate and Payment Change Limits.\" Therefore, on forms for the following round of testing, this \ntext was broken into two different headings: \"Rate Change Limits\" and \"Payment Change Limits.\"\n\nKey Questions Section\n\n. Although understanding of the Key Questions related to interest-only payments and negative amortization was \nbetter than in previous rounds, there were still a few participants who were confused by this text. Therefore, the \nwording of these questions and answers was revised for the following round.\n\nCredit Life Insurance\n\n. While participants understood most of the content in the credit life insurance disclosure tested this round, most did \nnot realize that purchasing this insurance might not provide them with any additional benefits. Therefore, this \ninformation was made more prominent in the version of this disclosure tested in the next round.\n\n\n\nROUND 13: BETHESDA, MARYLAND (MAY 2009)\n\nObjectives and Methodology\n\nIn May 2009, ICF Macro conducted nine cognitive interviews in Bethesda, MD. One goal of this round was to \ncontinue testing how effectively the revised TILA could describe the terms of complex loan products, such as \ninterest-only and payment option ARMs. Another goal was to continue testing the extent to which the text and \ngraphic in the APR section provided participants with useful context for comparing their APR to that being offered to \nother consumers.\n\nThe interview protocol included the following sections:\n\n. Participants in the interviews were first asked to review one of two TILA statements describing fixed-rate loans. \nThe primary focus of this portion of the interview was to assess participants' reaction to and understanding of the \nAPR section. The decision was made to use fixed-rate loans for this portion of the interview because in previous \nrounds of testing participants' reactions to forms they were shown were often driven by other loan features, such as \nan adjustable rate or a prepayment penalty, rather than by the APR. As a result, it was often difficult to isolate \nparticipants' reactions to a high APR. By testing the APR in the context of a simpler loan, ICF Macro and Board staff \ncould assess how a relatively high APR would affect participants' evaluation of a loan they might otherwise accept.\n\n. Next, participants were given a TILA statement that described an interest-only ARM product. They were then \nasked a series of questions designed to test their comprehension of information on the form.\n\n. Participants were next given a TILA statement describing a payment option ARM product, and again were asked a \nseries of questions designed to test their comprehension of the information.\n\n. After reviewing the TILA statements, participants were asked to review a revised disclosure related to credit life \ninsurance.\n\nFive forms were used in these sections of the interview; all are provided in Appendix D:\n\n. TILA statements L1 and L2 (describing fixed-rate loans; they were identical except for the information in the APR \nsection);\n\n. TILA statement M (describing an interest-only ARM);\n\n. TILA statement N (describing a payment-option ARM); and\n\n. Additional text about credit life insurance.\n\nKey Interview Findings\n\nLoan Summary Section (Versions L1 and L2)\n\n. All participants correctly identified the term of the loan (30 years) and the amount borrowed ($ 306,000).\n\n. Six of nine participants understood the settlement charges shown on the form did not include any down payment \nthey would owe; one participant did not answer this question.\n\n. Four participants were confused by the statement that $ 3,000 of their settlement charges were included in the \nloan amount shown. Some thought this statement might mean that they were actually borrowing a different amount \nthan that listed on the form. The remaining participants understood that the $ 3,000 of their settlement charges were \nalready included in the loan.\n\n. Almost all participants in this round understood that the $ 3,000 of settlement charges that were included in the \nloan amount were already reflected in the \"total estimated settlement charges\" listed on the form.\n\n\n\nAPR (Versions L1 and L2)\n\n. As in previous rounds, several participants initially confused the APR with the interest rate; several referred to the \nAPR as the \"interest rate\" throughout their review of the form. When it was pointed out to participants that the APR \nand interest rate were different, only one was able to explain that the APR was higher because it included \nsettlement charges. Others either indicated that they did not know why the terms were different or provided \nincorrect explanations.\n\n. Most participants understood the dot on the scale labeled \"Avg. Best APR\" represented the average APR offered \nto applicants with excellent credit. All but one understood that the \"high cost zone\" labeled on the scale represented \nthe range of more costly APRs that would likely be offered to consumers with poor credit.\n\n. When shown version L1, which showed an APR that was in the \"high cost zone,\" four of five participants \nindicated that this information made them view the loan more negatively and would make them less likely to accept \nthe loan. Among those who were shown L2, which had an APR just below the \"high cost zone,\" three of five \nparticipants indicated concern about the APR.\n\n. Among all participants, about half said that if they had excellent credit, they would want to make sure that they got \nan APR close to the \"average best\" APR shown on the form. The remaining participants indicated that the APR \ngraphic did not seem to consider this an important goal.\n\n. Half of the participants noticed the reference on the form that a 1% APR reduction would result in a savings of $ \n194 a month. Other participants said they understood that decreasing their APR would save them money, but did \nnot notice the information on the form about the specific amount they could save.\n\n. All but two participants understood there was no limit to how high the APR could be on a loan. The remaining two \nthought that the end of the scale (10.75%) represented the maximum APR that could be offered.\n\n. The L forms described the APR as the \"overall cost of the loan, including interest and settlement charges.\" \nParticipants were asked whether replacing the word \"overall\" in this description with the phrase \"fee-inclusive\" \nwould change their perception of what the APR signified. Almost all participants indicated this change would not \naffect their understanding of the APR. Most indicated that they found the term \"overall cost\" to be clearer than \"fee-\ninclusive cost\"; a few said that they found the reference to fees confusing. One participant, however, did appear to \nunderstand the meaning of the APR better when given the \"fee-inclusive\" language.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\nFixed-Rate Mortgage (Versions L1 and L2)\n\n. All participants understood their interest rate and payment would not change over time (except if the amount for \ntaxes and insurance changed).\n\nInterest-Only ARM (Version M)\n\n. Most participants were able to identify the initial interest rate of the loan, although two incorrectly identified the \nAPR as the interest rate. All participants understood that the interest rate could change after the 5-year introductory \nperiod.\n\n. All but two participants could identify the maximum interest rate; the remaining two incorrectly thought the rate \ncould increase above the maximum shown in the Payment Summary table.\n\n. All participants correctly identified the maximum their interest rate could be in Year 6. Aside from the maximum, \nhowever, participants seemed unclear as to what could happen to their rate. Some seemed to think their rate would \n\n\n\ndefinitely increase in Year 6 to the amount shown in the table while others understood their rate could also be \nlower than the amount shown.\n\n. Most participants indicated that they thought their interest rate was likely to increase after the introductory period \nended in March 2014. However, only a few participants referenced the information in the Introductory Rate Notice, \nwhich indicated that the initial rate was discounted and that the interest rate would increase after the introductory \nperiod, even if the market rate did not change. Most participants did not notice this information or did not realize \nhow it related to future rate and payment changes.\n\n. All but two participants understood their rate could adjust annually. The remaining two assumed the rate would \nadjust every two years after the introductory period ended, because that was the length of time between the second \nand third columns in the Payment Summary table.\n\n. Half of the participants were able to identify the maximum amount their rate could increase in a single year; others \ndid not notice this information in the More Information About Your Payments section.\n\n. Half of the participants realized during their initial reading of the form that payments during the introductory period \nwould be interest-only. All others noticed this information after reviewing the form further. Overall, the word \"None\" \nin the Payment Summary table seemed to make the fact that these payments were interest-only more prominent.\n\nPayment Option ARM (Version N)\n\n. Two participants had heard of a payment option mortgage prior to their interview.\n\n. After their initial review of the TILA statement, most participants expressed concern with some aspect of the \npayment option loan. Some features that participants mentioned included: the fact that their loan balance could \nincrease; the fact that minimum payments would not pay off any principal; and the fact that the interest rate was \nadjustable. When asked if anything concerned them about this loan, one participant responded \"everything.\" \nAnother commented that the loan would make it \"too easy\" for a borrower to get into trouble if they made only the \nminimum payments.\n\n. All participants understood that their interest rate was adjustable and could begin changing as soon as the second \nmonth.\n\n. All but one participant correctly identified the initial interest rate; the remaining participant confused the initial \ninterest rate with the APR. All but one was also able to identify the maximum interest rate.\n\n. All but two participants understood their minimum payment would increase over time, and could increase \ndramatically in June 2011 when the loan would require a fully amortizing payment.\n\n. Most participants understood the minimum payment covered only some interest and no principal, while the full \npayment covered both. Two participants understood that the minimum payment covered no principal, but \nmistakenly thought that it covered all interest.\n\n. All but two participants understood that making the minimum payments would cause the loan balance to increase \nover time. Not all understood why this occurred, however; a few indicated that the loan balance would increase \nbecause the principal was not being paid off, rather than because of unpaid interest.\n\n. After being directed to read the statement at the bottom of the page that explained making minimum payments \nwould lead to an increase of $ 29,943.00 to the loan amount, all participants indicated that this information would \nmake them less likely to make minimum payments.\n\nTaxes and Insurance (Escrow)\n\nInterest-Only ARM\n\n\n\n. Although all participants indicated they had previously heard the term \"escrow\"; when asked to describe it, \nhowever, only six were able to do so accurately.\n\n. All but two of the participants realized the payments for the interest-only loan included PMI. Most saw this \ninformation in the More Information About Your Payments section on the second page, rather than in the note \nabout PMI in the Payment Summary table.\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n. As in the previous round, most participants did not realize taxes and insurance were included in the monthly \npayments shown on the form. Only three participants in this round of testing understood that this was the case, \nwhile other participants either assumed that taxes and insurance were not included or were not sure.\n\nKey Questions Section\n\nInterest-Only ARM\n\n. All participants realized, based on their initial review of the form, that the interest-only ARM had a prepayment \npenalty feature. Most of the participants noticed this feature on the first page of the form, rather than from the Key \nQuestions on the second page of the form.\n\n. When asked to read the Key Question related to interest-only payments, all but one participant understood the \ninformation clearly. One incorrectly thought that making interest-only payments would cause the loan balance to \nincrease.\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n. Participants were asked to read the Key Questions related to interest-only payments and negative amortization \nand explain what they said. Most participants understood both features and the impact that they would each have \non the loan balance over time. However, as in previous rounds a few participants confused the two For example, \ntwo participants indicated that making interest-only payments would cause the loan balance to increase.\n\n\"More Information About Your Payments\" Section\n\nInterest-Only ARM\n\n. When asked to read the text under the Rate Calculation heading, almost all participants were able to explain that \ntheir rate would be equal to the LIBOR index plus 5%. While some had never heard of the LIBOR index, most \ngenerally understood the concept that their rate would vary based on a market rate.\n\n. All but one participant understood the annual and periodic rate change caps described under the heading Rate \nChange Limits. However, as noted above about half of the participants did not see this information until it was \npointed out to them.\n\n. As in previous rounds, almost all participants understood the text under the heading Total Payments, although \nnone understood what the \"amount financed\" signified.\n\nPayment Option ARM\n\n\n\n. Almost all participants were able to explain the information under the heading Rate Change Limits on the payment \noption ARM statement, including that their rate could increase to a maximum of 10.5% and that it could start \nadjusting the first month after consummation. This was an improvement from the previous round, when participants \ndid not understand this text.\n\n. As in the previous round of testing, participants were generally confused by the information under the heading \nPayment Changes. While some understood that their payments could increase no more than 7.5% a year at the \nbeginning of the loan, they generally did not understand the relationship between caps on payments and the loan \nbalance or what would happen after the loan balance cap was reached.\n\nCredit Life insurance\n\n. All participants understood after reading the notice that credit life insurance was not a required feature.\n\n. Participants generally understood the first two bulleted statements. Most participants were surprised by the third \nstatement, which stated that even if they paid for the insurance they may \"not qualify to receive benefits in the \nfuture.\" A few indicated they did not understand how they could pay for the coverage and then receive no benefits. \nDespite their surprise, participants seemed to understand the statement; all but two correctly indicated that if they \npurchased the coverage and then died, the insurance would not necessarily pay off their loan. Most assumed that \nthe reason a borrower would not be covered would be because of pre-existing medical conditions or suicide.\n\n. When asked whether they would purchase credit life insurance, all but one participant indicated they would not--in \nfact, one participant had recently purchased credit life insurance and was planning to re-read the paperwork after \nthe interview. The remaining participant, however, indicated he would purchase credit life insurance after reading \nthe notice.\n\n . When asked how much credit life insurance would cost for a $ 200,000 loan, five of seven participants correctly \nanswered $ 144 per month. The remaining two gave the figure shown on the form ($ 72 per month), which was the \nincremental cost for each $ 100,000. Two participants were not asked this question.\n\n. Most participants indicated they would be likely to visit the website shown on the notice if they had additional \nquestions about credit life insurance.\n\nLoan Obligation\n\n. Because the forms used in this round specifically stated that a signature on the part of the borrower merely \nindicates receipt of the form, six participants understood that by signing they would not be committing themselves to \nthe loan terms. However, three participants incorrectly thought that signing the form would indicate a commitment to \nthe lender.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\nLoan Summary Section\n\n. Because participant understanding of the frequency of rate and payment change was higher than in the previous \ntwo rounds, the decision was made to include this information under the Loan Type heading, as was done in this \nround.\n\nRate and Payment Information\n\n\n\n. For interest-only loans, the use of the word \"none\" in the Payment Summary table indicating none of the payment \nwould be used to pay principal seemed to make this information clearer and more noticeable to participants. \nTherefore, this notation was used in the final TILA statement models and clauses.\n\nAPR\n\n. Most participants in this round indicated that the term \"overall cost\" was a clearer descriptor of the APR than \"fee-\ninclusive cost\"; there was no clear difference between the two terms in how well they explained the meaning of the \nterm. Therefore, the decision was made to use the phrase \"overall cost\" in the final model forms and clauses.\n\n. The revised format of the APR graphic--particularly the use of the term \"high cost zone\"--appeared to improve its \neffectiveness at communicating to participants the costs of having a high APR. Compared to the previous round of \ntesting in Denver, more participants in this round indicated that if they had excellent credit they would expect to get \nan APR near the \"average best APR\" shown on the scale. Therefore, this basic format was used in the APR \nsection of the final model forms and clauses.\n\n\"More Information About Your Payments\" Section\n\n. Because participants were more likely in this round to realize the interest-only loan they reviewed included PMI, \nthe decision was made to retain the separate heading \"Private Mortgage Insurance\" in this section of the forms and \nclauses.\n\n. Although participants who reviewed the payment option ARM still did not understand the relationship between the \ncaps on payments and the loan balance, their understanding of the rate change limits was significantly better than \nin the previous round. Therefore, the decision was made to retain separate headings for \"Rate Change Limits\" and \n\"Payment Change Limits\" on the model forms and clauses for payment option ARMs.\n\n CHAPTER VI: DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF OTHER TYPES OF MORTGAGE DISCLOSURES\n\nAlthough the primary focus of most rounds of interviews for this project was on testing current and revised TILA \nstatements, ICF Macro and Board staff also developed and tested several other types of disclosures. These \nincluded several new early disclosures, a revised initial program disclosure, a rate adjustment notice for ARMs, and \na payment option monthly payment disclosure explaining the consequences of making less than the full payment \neach month. In most cases, these disclosures were developed by ICF Macro and tested in only one round of \ninterviews, after which small changes in wording were made to address any comprehension issues that had \nbecome apparent through testing.\n\nThis chapter of this report describes the development and testing of these other disclosures.\n\nNEW EARLY DISCLOSURES ABOUT MORTGAGE RISKS\n\n\"Mortgage Risk Worksheet\"\n\nFor the round of interviews held in Baltimore, MD (Round 7), ICF Macro developed a new early disclosure called \nthe \"Mortgage Risk Worksheet.\" This document listed six mortgage features that are potentially risky or costly: an \nadjustable rate, balloon payment, interest-only payments/negative amortization, prepayment penalty, no-\ndocumentation or low-documentation loans, and direct payment of taxes and insurance. For each of the six \nfeatures, the form provided a description of the feature and the potential benefits, risks, and costs. In each case, the \nparticipant was asked to decide whether or not they were comfortable with the risk and to indicate if their comfort \n\n\n\nlevel by checking a box. Since the intent of the Mortgage Risk Worksheet was to ensure that individuals were \naffirmatively \"opting in\" to risky loan features, the form did not include a box for participants to check if they were not \ninterested in a particular feature.\n\nParticipants in the Baltimore interviews were shown the Mortgage Risk Worksheet and asked to provide initial \nreaction and feedback. They were then asked to explain several portions of the form, to learn the extent to which \nthey understood the content. Finally, they were asked to describe how, if at all they would use this worksheet in \ntheir own mortgage shopping process. The form that was shown to participants is provided in Appendix D.\n\nKey Findings\n\n. The Mortgage Risk Worksheet was received favorably by most participants. However, some more experienced \nparticipants indicated the Worksheet would be of minimal value to them because they already understood the risks \nassociated with these loan features.\n\n . Most participants indicated they learned something from reading the form. Most often, participants said they had \nlearned something about balloon payments, negative amortization, or \"no-doc\"/\"low-doc\" loans.\n\n. Participants generally understood most of the content on the form. However, several were confused by the \ndifference between an \"interest-only loan\" and one with negative amortization. This confusion may have been \nexacerbated by the fact that these two loan features were combined into a single row in the worksheet.\n\n. Some participants were confused by the last row of the worksheet, which related to \"direct payment of property \ntaxes and homeowner's insurance.\" The source of this confusion seemed to be that while most rows addressed the \npresence of a risky loan feature, this last row addressed the absence of an escrow account. As a result, several \nparticipants mistakenly thought that by checking the box in the right-hand column they were indicating they did want \nan escrow account--when in fact a checkmark meant that they would consider a loan that required them to save for \ntaxes and insurance themselves.\n\n. A few participants had difficulty understanding the row on \"no-doc\"/\"low-doc\" loans. In most cases, participants \nconfused by this row seemed to understand the content but were surprised that these types of loans existed.\n\n. Several participants suggested additional features be added to the worksheet, such as fixed rate loans and PMI. \nOthers suggested the document should provide a full glossary of loan terminology. Based on these suggestions, it \nwas clear the participants did not understand that the Mortgage Risk Worksheet was designed specifically to alert \nconsumers about loan features that might be particularly risky or costly. Instead, they viewed it as a source of \ngeneral information about mortgage terms.\n\n. Participants generally understood how the form was intended to be used--that is, that potential borrowers were to \nread and complete the worksheet and then use it as a basis for discussion with their lender or broker. However, \nmost participants indicated they would be unlikely to complete the worksheet or bring it to meetings with their \nlenders or brokers. Participants seemed to feel that the usefulness of the form lay in the information it provided and \nthat actually completing it would provide minimum additional value for them.\n\n\n\n. Several participants did not like the fact that the worksheet only offered a checkbox to indicate they were \ncomfortable with the risk. They felt a second checkbox should be provided in each row indicating that the potential \nborrower is not comfortable with the risk associated with that feature.\n\n. Several participants commented that a worksheet like this would only be valuable if lenders and brokers were held \naccountable for collecting it and keeping consumers' stated preferences in mind when presenting loan offers. A few \neven recommended that the form include a signature line for the potential borrower and lender, to show that \nconsumers' preferences had been collected and discussed.\n\n Subsequent Design Decisions\n\n. While participants indicated that much of the content in this disclosure was important and helpful to them, most \nsaid they would not use the form as intended. As a result, the decision was made at this time not to require lenders \nto provide this type of worksheet to all potential borrowers.\n\n. Because ICF Macro and Board staff believed that the content of the Mortgage Risk Worksheet was important in \nhelping consumers understand and assess the risk associated with adjustable-rate and other loan products, a new \nearly disclosure was designed for the following round of testing. This new document, which was titled \"Six Key \nQuestions to Ask About Your Mortgage,\" moved away from the \"worksheet\" structure of the original form but \nprovided much of the same information about potentially risky loan terms.\n\n\"Key Questions to Ask About Your Mortgage\" Disclosure\n\nThe disclosure titled \"Six Key Questions to Ask About Your Mortgage,\" which was developed following the \nBaltimore round of testing, listed six questions consumers should ask their lender about a loan offer, as well as an \nexplanation for why each question is important.\n\nThe Key Questions early disclosure was designed to be provided to consumers when they first inquire with a lender \nor broker about getting a mortgage. However, the questions shown on the form mirrored those shown on the \nrevised TILA statement. The intent of this parallel construction was that during the shopping stage, consumers \nwould ask their lender or broker these questions about the loan they were being offered. Once they applied for the \nloan, the TILA statement would allow them to confirm the answers they had been given.\n\nThis early disclosure was tested with participants in the Atlanta round of interviews in November 2008 (Round 8). \nBased on findings from this round, the disclosure was revised and tested again with participants in Dallas in \nFebruary 2009 (Round 10). Content was added to the form for this round; the version of the Key Questions \ndisclosure tested in Dallas lists nine questions instead of the original six.\n\nParticipants in both rounds (Atlanta and Dallas) were shown the Key Questions disclosure near the end of the \ninterview and asked to provide initial reactions and feedback. They were then asked to explain several items on the \nform, to gather data on the extent to which they understood the content. Both versions of the Key Questions \ndisclosure are provided in Appendix D.\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\n. When asked to rate the usefulness of the Key Questions document on a scale of 1 (\"not at all useful\") to 10 \n(\"extremely useful\"), almost all participants in both rounds of testing gave the document a rating of 9 or 10. No \nparticipants gave the form a rating lower than 7.\n\n. Participants liked the \"question and answer\" format and thought the content would be particularly helpful for first-\ntime buyers.\n\n . Participants in both rounds of testing generally understood the intended purpose of the disclosure. While many \nindicated they would not necessarily ask their lender the exact questions shown on the page, some said they \nwould use the information on the form to develop their own list of questions.\n\n. When asked whether they had learned anything from reading the form, about half of the participants indicated that \nthey had In Atlanta, participants most frequently said they had learned something about negative amortization, \ninterest-only payments, or balloon payments. In Dallas, participants most frequently indicated they had learned \nsomething about equity-sharing features, demand features, and \"no-doc\"/\"low-doc\" loans--in fact, several said they \nhad never heard of these three features before reading the Key Questions disclosure.\n\n. Participants in both rounds generally understood the questions related to variable interest rates, payment \nchanges, and prepayment penalties; these were all terms and concepts with which participants were already \nfamiliar.\n\n. In general, the questions that were least understood by participants were those relating to interest-only payments \nand negative amortization. Several participants confused these two features and were unclear as to the difference \nbetween them. This was particularly true in Atlanta, when the question about negative amortization immediately \npreceded the question related to interest-only payments. The order of these two questions was flipped in Dallas, \nwhich appeared to alleviate the confusion between them--although some participants continued to struggle to \ndistinguish the two.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\n. Between the Atlanta and Dallas rounds, several small changes were made to the wording of both the questions \nand the answers. These revisions, along with the reversal of the order of questions relating to negative amortization \nand interest-only payments, seemed to improve comprehension of the document slightly.\n\n. Because participants in both the Atlanta and Dallas rounds reacted so positively to the Key Questions disclosure, \nand indicated that they would find the information useful, the Board is proposing that this document be provided to \nall prospective borrowers. The final model form includes seven of the nine Key Questions listed on the version used \nin Dallas. 30\n\n30 \n\nTwo Key Questions relating to loan features that are relatively rare in the market (equity sharing and demand features) were \nremoved from the form, because of concerns that if the disclosure were too long fewer consumers would read it.\n\n \n\n\n\nREVISED ARM LOAN PROGRAM DISCLOSURE\n\nAs described in Chapter III, ICF Macro tested the current version of the ARM loan program disclosure through focus \ngroups in Greenbelt, MD and Los Angeles, CA (Rounds 1 and 4). Participants' reaction to the disclosure was fairly \nnegative; most indicated they found it difficult to understand and that, because the content was so general, the form \nwould not help them shop between products or lenders.\n\nPrior to the round of interviews in Providence, RI (Round 11), ICF Macro developed a revised program disclosure \nform. This form included four terms that are important distinguishing characteristics of an ARM program: the length \nof the introductory period, the frequency of rate change, the index used to calculate the rate, and limits on rate \nchanges. It also provided answers to the Key Questions used on the TILA statement. The intended timing of this \ndisclosure was the same as the current ARM program disclosure; consumers would be provided with the document \nat the point before they have applied for a loan. The revised program disclosure form that was tested in Providence \nis provided in Appendix D.\n\nParticipants in the Providence interviews were asked to read the revised program disclosure and provide general \ncomments on the extent to which they would find the form useful. They were then asked a series of questions \ndesigned to test their understanding of the content.\n\nKey Findings\n\n. Participants understood that the purpose of the ARM loan program disclosure was to provide general information \nabout a lender's loan program. They understood that this disclosure differed from transaction-specific documents \nlike the TILA, because the lender could not provide specific information about interest rates before application.\n\n. Six participants understood that the information on the form was being provided by the lender. Three were not \nsure who was responsible for the information provided, while one thought the information on the form was coming \nfrom \"the government.\"\n\n. Comprehension of the information on the program-specific page was generally high. All but one participant \nunderstood that their rate could begin changing after 3 years, and all knew that their rate would change annually \nafter that point. Three participants mistakenly thought that the maximum interest rate on the loan would be 6%; in \nfact, this was the maximum increase in the interest rate. When asked if anything was confusing to them, two \nparticipants indicated they found the LIBOR index and margin as well as limits on the rate change and interest caps \ndifficult to understand.\n\n. Eight participants understood without prompting that the loan being described had both demand and equity-\nsharing features. Once they had read the information about these features, all participants understood them clearly. \nAll participants indicated that these features would make them less likely to accept the loan; several were surprised \nbecause they had not known that mortgages could have these features.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\n. Because participants' understanding and perceived usefulness of the revised program disclosure form were \ndramatically higher than the current version, the Board will propose to include the revised form in its proposed \nregulations.\n\n. Because a few participants mistakenly thought that the reference to a \"6% lifetime cap\" referred to a limit on the \ninterest rate itself rather than the change in the rate, the wording of this reference was revised following the \n\n \n\n\n\nProvidence round of testing to state that the interest rate can increase \"no more than 6% total for the life of the \nloan.\"\n\nNEW EARLY DISCLOSURE:\n\"FIXED VS. ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES\"\n\nFor the round of interviews held in Providence, RI (Round 7), ICF Macro developed a new early disclosure. This \none-page document provided information about the relative advantages and disadvantages of an ARM compared to \na fixed-rate loan, most of which currently appears in the CHARM booklet. The intent was that this publication would \nbe provided to consumers at the point when they first expressed interest in a mortgage. The document that was \ntested is provided in Appendix D.\n\nParticipants in the Providence interviewers were given this new early disclosure together with the revised program \ndisclosure described above. They were asked to comment on the extent to which they would find this information \nuseful, and were then asked questions designed to test their understanding of the form.\n\nKey Findings\n\n. Participants understood that the purpose of this disclosure was to provide them with information about ARMs, and \nabout the relative advantages and disadvantages of this type of loan product compared to a fixed-rate mortgage.\n\n. Participants generally had a favorable reaction to the page comparing fixed rate to adjustable rate mortgages. \nParticipants commented that the information was clear and easy-to-understand, and they did not identify anything \nthat they found unclear or confusing. Several participants particularly liked the box that directly compared the two \nproducts and provided suggestions for when to consider each of them.\n\n. Half of the participants understood the information on this page was coming from the Board, as opposed to a \nlender or broker. Other participants understood this was the case only after the Board logo and heading (\"Federal \nReserve Board Consumer Protection Resources\") were pointed out to them.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\n. Because participants generally understood the information on this disclosure and indicated that the information \nwould be useful to them, lenders would be required to provide these forms to potential borrowers.\n\nARM ADJUSTMENT NOTICE\n\nCurrently, Regulation Z requires lenders to notify ARM borrowers of a change to the interest rate; if the borrower's \npayment will change, the lender must send the notice in advance of the change. Regulation Z does not contain a \nmodel form for this disclosure.\n\nPrior to the round of interviews in Providence, RI (Round 11), ICF Macro developed a model notice to inform \nborrowers that their interest rate had been changed and would change their monthly payment. The specific terms \nshown on the notice also indicated that the borrower would begin paying interest, whereas previous payments had \nbeen interest-only. The notice shown to participants is provided in Appendix D.\n\nParticipants in the Providence interviews were asked to review this notice and provide initial reactions and \ncomments. They were then asked a series of questions designed to test their understanding of the content.\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\n. Participants generally understood the form content and recognized all aspects of the loan that would be changing. \nAll interview participants correctly identified the amount of the new payment, as well as the date that it would be \ndue. Almost all participants recognized without prompting that their rate was increasing, the amount they pay for \ntaxes and insurance was increasing, and their new payments would begin paying off the loan principal.\n\n. All but one participant saw the information on the form indicating that if they tried to refinance into another loan, \nthey would be subject to a prepayment penalty.\n\n. When asked what they would do if they realized they would be unable to make their new payments, six \nparticipants indicated they would call their lender, while four said they would use one or more of the resources listed \nat the bottom of the form. Two participants said that they most likely would not seek out any type of assistance \nbecause they did not believe doing so would be helpful.\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\n. Because comprehension of this notice was generally very high, the model ARM adjustment notice published by \nthe Board with its proposed rules in July 2009 will be almost identical to that which was tested with consumers. \n31PAYMENT OPTION MONTHLY PAYMENT DISCLOSURE\n\nPrior to the round of interviews in Denver, CO (Round 12), ICF Macro developed a model disclosure to include with \nmonthly statements for payment option mortgages. This disclosure describes a borrower's payment options for that \nmonth, along with the impact that each would have on their loan balance and future payments. The disclosure \nshown to participants is provided in Appendix D.\n\nParticipants in the Denver interviews were asked to review this disclosure and provide initial reactions and \ncomments. They were then asked a series of questions designed to test their understanding of the content.\n\nKey Findings\n\n. All participants understood that the purpose of this disclosure was to inform them of their payment options, along \nwith the consequences of selecting a particular payment.\n\n. Participants felt the information was very clearly presented; they had no questions following their review of the \ndisclosure. One participant, however, expressed doubt that lenders would ever be this honest when describing the \nconsequences of making minimum payments.\n\n. Most interview participants understood if they made the minimum payment they would be borrowing more money \nand increasing their loan balance. Most also understood that if they made minimum payments they would have to \nmake much larger payments in the future.\n\n. All but two participants understood that if they made an interest-only payment they would be paying only interest \nand would not be paying off principal. The remaining two participants confused the consequences of an interest-\nonly payment with those of the minimum payment, and indicated that making an interest-only payment would also \ncause the loan balance to increase.\n\n31 \n\nThe model form published by the Board will also show loan balance and other loan features where applicable, such as interest \nrate carryover.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\n. Because comprehension of the content was generally very high, the model payment option monthly payment \ndisclosure published by the Board with its proposed rules in July 2009 will be almost identical to that which was \ntested with consumers in this round.\n\nNEW EARLY DISCLOSURE: MORTGAGE SHOPPING CHECKLIST\n\nFor the round of interviews held in Baltimore, MD (Round 7), ICF Macro developed another early disclosure. Called \nthe \"Mortgage Shopping Checklist,\" the goal of this one-page document was to provide consumers with six action \nsteps they should take before applying for a mortgage loan. These action steps were intended to make consumers \nmore knowledgeable about mortgages, and to improve their ability to shop effectively between lenders. The \ndisclosure was designed with the intent that it would be provided to consumers when they first contacted a lender or \nbroker about obtaining a mortgage.\n\nParticipants in the Baltimore interviews were shown the Mortgage Shopping Checklist and asked to provide initial \nreaction and feedback. They were then asked to explain several sections of the form, to gather data on the extent \nto which they understood the content. The Checklist shown to participants is provided in Appendix D.\n\nKey Findings\n\n. About half of participants indicated they would find this document helpful if they were in the process of looking for \na mortgage. Some said if they had been given this information when they bought their first home it would have \nsaved them time and money.\n\n. Participants who indicated that the document would not be useful to them tended to be more experienced \nborrowers who had been through the mortgage process multiple times. Several believed they were already effective \nshoppers and did not need additional guidance. Some of these participants, however, thought the Checklist would \nbe a useful resource for first-time borrowers.\n\n. One participant commented the document would be more useful if it actually provided information about \nmortgages, rather than simply recommending other resources.\n\n. Several participants expressed surprise that the Federal Reserve Board would produce a document like this for \nconsumers, because they did not know this was one of the Board's roles. Others had not known that the Board \noffered resources such as consumer-oriented websites.\n\n. Approximately half the participants said they would be likely to call the phone number listed at the bottom of the \npage and request the \"Mortgage Shopping Package.\" Others said they would be unlikely to do so, because they did \nnot believe that this information would be useful to them.\n\n. Some participants indicated that in addition to the six items on the checklist, they would like more information on \ntopics including: the timeline of the mortgage process; how to identify reputable lenders and/or brokers; an \nexplanation of closing costs; suggestions on how to improve your credit score; and how to read and understand \nmortgage disclosures.\n\n. Several participants suggested that if the Board produced a resource like this, they should be sure to promote it to \nincrease awareness of its availability.\n\n. A few participants commented that in addition to this form, the Board should also provide in-person workshops and \nmortgage counseling.\n\n. One participant indicated that he would be unlikely to get quotes from multiple lenders if doing so required that he \npay multiple application fees.\n\n\n\nSubsequent Design Decisions\n\n. Because half of the participants indicated they did not find the content of this disclosure to be helpful, the decision \nwas made not to require that a Mortgage Shopping Checklist be provided to all potential borrowers. However, \nbecause other participants--particularly less experienced borrowers--said that a checklist like this would be useful, \nthe Board plans to explore options for how to provide this information through consumer education materials.\n\nCHAPTER VII: SUMMARY\n\nThis report summarizes work conducted by ICF Macro from December 2007 through June 2009 in support of the \nBoard's efforts to revise Regulation Z rules pertaining to closed-end mortgage disclosures. The outcomes of this \nwork include the development of:\n\n. A significantly revised TILA statement that:\n. Emphasizes potential changes in rates and payments;\n\n. Highlights potentially risky or costly loan features;\n\n. Helps consumers verify key terms they might have considered before applying for a particular loan; and\n\n. Provides context for how the loan APR compares with what other recent borrowers have been offered;\n\n. A new document titled \"Key Questions to Ask About Your Loan,\" a concise and easy-to read disclosure for \npotential borrowers that provides guidance on what questions they should ask their lenders;\n\n. A new disclosure titled \"Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages,\" which will be provided to potential borrowers to \nexplain the relative advantages of fixed and adjustable rate loan products;\n\n. A revised ARM loan program disclosure that is simpler and more useful to consumers than that which is currently \nin use;\n\n. A revised ARM adjustment notice that describes future interest rate and payment changes; and\n\n. A new payment option monthly payment disclosure for consumers with payment option and other negative \namortization mortgages that describes the consequences of making less than the full payment each month.\n\nThe results of the research described in this report will inform the Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z, which \nare scheduled for release in July 2009. The disclosure forms developed through iterative testing will be released \nwith the proposal as model forms and clauses. By relying heavily on direct consumer testing in the development of \nthese forms, the Board hopes to ensure that its new regulations will lead to financial disclosures that will be easier \nfor consumers to read and understand, and as a result will help them make well-informed financial decisions.\n\nAPPENDIX A: Research Timeline\n\nRound Type of\n\n# Location Date(s) Testing\n\nFocus Groups\n\n\n\nRound Type of\n\n# Location Date(s) Testing\n1 Greenbelt, MD February 20, 2008 (2)\n\nInterviews\n\n2 Washington, DC March 4 & 6, 2008 (7)\n\nInterviews\n\n3 Los Angeles, CA March 25-26, 2008 (7)\n\nFocus Groups\n\n4 Los Angeles, CA March 25-26, 2008 Focus (2)\n\nApril 30 & May 1, Interviews\n\n5 Washington, DC 2008 (10)\n\n6 Kansas City, KS May 13-14, 2008 Interviews (11)\n\nInterviews\n\n7 Baltimore, MD August 20-21, 2008 (10)\n\n8 Atlanta, GA November 5-6, 2008 Interviews\n(9)\n\nInterviews\n\n9 Bethesda, MD January 27 & 29, 2009 (9)\n\nInterviews\n\n10 Dallas, TX February 24-25, 2009 (10)\n\nMarch 31 & April 1, Interviews\n\n11 Providence, RI 2009 (10)\n\n12 Denver, CO April 21-22, 2009 Interviews (10)\n\nInterviews\n\n13 Bethesda, MD May 6-7, 2009 (9)\n\n\n\nRound\n\n# Topics Addressed\n.

testing, two participants did not provide their age.\n<2>Participants' responses to three questions were used to categorize them as likely prime or subprime borrowers. \nParticipants were categorized as \"subprime\" if they had: a) suffered a \"financial hardship\" such as bankruptcy, \nforeclosure, repossession or a tax lien in the past 7 years; b) been denied credit or discouraged from applying for \ncredit in the past 2 years; or c) the current interest rate on their loan was higher than established HMDA thresholds \n(see Footnote 4 below).\n<3>Only respondents whose most recent mortgage was for a home purchase (as opposed to a refinance) \nanswered this question.\n<4>The interest rate thresholds that were used to classify respondents as \"subprime\" were set to be roughly \nconsistent with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) APR-based thresholds for reporting higher-priced \nloans. For Rounds 1 through 8, the 2007-08 HMDA thresholds were used: 8 percent for a first mortgage and 10 \npercent for a second or third mortgage. For Rounds 9 through 13, these rates were adjusted to the 2008-09 HMDA \nthresholds: 7.5 percent for a first mortgage and 9.5 percent for a second or third mortgage.\n<5>Percentages of participants by demographic category may contain a small rounding error, of less than to 1%.\n\n<6>Some interviews were conducted with couples who indicated that they made mortgage decisions together. In \nthese cases, the personal information shown in this table was collected from the member of the couple who \nresponded to the recruitment screening questions.\n<7>In this round of testing, one participant did not provide their education level.\n<8>In this round, one participant did not provide the reason for their most recent loan.\n\n<9>Participants that had never obtained a mortgage loan were not asked any of the subsequent questions about \ntheir loan history.\n<10>In this round, one participant did not indicate whether he had an ARM in the past 5 years.\n<11>In this round, one participant did not indicate the method through which they obtained their most recent \nmortgage.\n<12>In this round, one participant did not indicate whether his most recent loan was obtained through the FHA or \nVA.\n\n[SEE APPENDIX D DISCLOSURE FORMS USES IN TESTING IN ORIGINAL]\n"}
