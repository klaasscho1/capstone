{"title": "BILL ON IMMIGRANT WORKERS DIES", "body": "\nLegislation to allow nearly twice as many computer-savvy foreigners and other high-skilled immigrants into the \ncountry next year apparently has died in Congress.\nThe House passed the compromise measure last month, 288-133, but Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, had blocked a \nvote when in the Senate. The proposal, backed by high-tech companies, would raise the limit of so-called H-1B \nvisas granted each year to skilled workers from abroad. Only 65,000 visas are now granted each year; the bill \nwould raise the annual cap to 115,500 for the next two years and to 107,500 in 2001. The ceiling would return to \n65,000 in 2002.\n"}
