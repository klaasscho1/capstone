{"title": "Immigration Rules and Fairness", "body": "\n  President Bush's push for changing immigration legislation is at first glance a positive sign [front page, Dec. 20]. \nBut on second look, it is enraging and unfair.  \n\nAs someone who is trying to immigrate legally to the United States, I feel that granting amnesty to those who are \nundocumented (here legally or illegally) is upsetting. My family has been waiting three years -- and will be waiting at \nleast another seven -- for our paperwork. We follow procedures, rules and laws as precisely and accurately as \npossible. Yet the undocumented will be rewarded for not following U.S. immigration procedures.  \n\nI hope the Bush administration realizes that its priorities are askew. It should be concentrating on fixing the grueling \nfamily immigration system, which leaves family members such as mine apart for years on end. \n\nSALMA KHALIL \n\nNew York \n"}
