{"title": "The Many Paths on Immigration", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n  It's precisely because Americans are fed up because they have to ''press one for English'' that the Senate voted \nfor English to be the national language.\n\n Previous generations of immigrants came to this country not knowing English, yet they learned our language and \nconformed to our customs -- not the other way around. \n\n  We always have been ''Out of many, one,'' and that includes our one and only language, English. \n\n  The melting pot worked. Why change now?\n\nCarla Wallach\n\nGreenwich, Conn., May 21, 2006\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
