{"title": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT Busy bill sponsor", "body": "\nIn a five-minute flurry of bill-passing activity Monday, the state Assembly approved five bills primarily sponsored \nby Flushing Assemblyman Brian McLaughlin.\n\nThe Immigrant Services Act would install safeguards against unscrupulous immigration consultants, and the \nTransportation of School Children with Disabilities bill would require that bus drivers have sufficient information \nabout youngsters' specific disabilities. \n\nThe three other bills are meant to streamline state regulations.\n\nMcLaughlin said the quick vote did not reflect the years of legislative work that went into forging the bills, and the \nnumber of people who will benefit.\n\n\"We in government often have days that make us proud,\" he said. \"This is one of them.\"\n\nTo become law, the bills also must pass the state Senate and be signed by Gov. Pataki.\n\nNew court forum\n\nThe Integrated Domestic Violence Court recently established in Queens will be the topic at a seminar Feb. 10 from \n6 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Belson Moot Courtroom of St. John's University School of Law, 8800 Utopia Parkway, \nJamaica.
