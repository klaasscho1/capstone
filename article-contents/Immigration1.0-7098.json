{"title": "Appeals Judge Halts Release Of Immigrant", "body": "\nA Federal appeals court judge today blocked the release of a 31-year-old Palestinian immigrant who has been \ndetained for 18 months on the basis of classified evidence of alleged links to terrorists. The judge also ruled that \nthe case be taken up next week by a three-judge panel.\n\nNoting that there were \"complex jurisdictional and due process questions\" involved in the case, Judge Leonard \nGarth, in the Federal Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, stayed a lower-court order that the immigrant, Hany \nKiareldeen, be immediately released from jail in Hudson County, N.J.\n\nBut the judge told the parties in the case to file their legal briefs by Tuesday, and said he would recommend \"very \nstrongly\" that the three-judge Court of Appeals panel expedite the matter since \"there is very questionable legal \nauthority at the moment for holding\" Mr. Kiareldeen.\n\nOn Wednesday, Judge William H. Walls of Federal District Court issued a forceful ruling that Mr. Kiareldeen's \ndetention violated basic due-process rights in the Constitution, and ordered his release. But Judge Garth blocked \nthat order after the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court in \nthe case.\n\nIn granting a temporary stay of the release order, the appeals judge said he had planted himself midway between \nthe Government's request for an indefinite stay pending resolution of the entire case and the position of Mr. \nKiareldeen's lawyers and Judge Walls that he be released immediately.\n\nMr. Kiareldeen remains in the Hudson County Correctional Center.  The secret evidence on which he has been \ndetained, according to unclassified and sketchy summaries of Federal Bureau of Investigation reports, alleges that \nhe met with Nidal A. Ayyad, a convicted conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, just a week before \nthe bombing, uttered threats against the life of Attorney General Janet Reno and was associated with terrorist \ngroups.\n\nMr. Kiareldeen, a native of Gaza who has lived in the United States for nine years, has denied the allegations, \nsaying they are the angry concoctions of his vindictive ex-wife.\n\nToday's decision by the appeals judge capped a week of rapid developments in the case, which has broken new \nlegal ground on the issue of secret evidence at almost every turn.\n\n\nOn Monday, a Board of Immigration Appeals panel released a ruling that rejected the secret evidence against Mr. \nKiareldeen as unreliable, upholding an earlier determination by an Immigration Court judge.  The board ordered the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to cease trying to deport Mr. Kiareldeen and to grant him a green card as a \nresident alien, based largely on his 1997 marriage to an American citizen.\n\nOn Wednesday, Judge Walls issued his decision in a Federal lawsuit that Mr. Kiareldeen had brought in August. It \nwas the first ruling by a judge that the use of secret evidence in detaining an immigrant was an unconstitutional \nviolation of due process. Later that day, a different Board of Immigration Appeals panel, hearing another facet of \nthe case, ordered the I.N.S. to release Mr. Kiareldeen on $1,500 bond.\n\nToday, Douglas Ginsburg, a Justice Department lawyer in the Office of Immigration Litigation, said the immigration \nagency had asked the board to stay its bond ruling. A spokesman for the board, Susan Eastwood, said the panel, \nwhich is part of the Justice Department's Executive Office of Immigration Review, had yet to rule on the stay \nrequest.\n\nThose involved in the case say that if the board denies the request, Mr. Kiareldeen could be released regardless of \nJudge Garth's temporary stay, unless the immigration agency appeals directly to Attorney General Reno to \noverturn the decision.\n\nAn appeal would force Ms. Reno to mediate a long-simmering difference of opinion among four agencies within her \ndepartment: on one side, the F.B.I. and the immigration service, which say Mr. Kiareldeen is a danger, and on the \nother side, the Immigration Courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals, whose administrative law judges have \nrepeatedly rejected that point of view.\n\nMike Gilhooly, a spokesman for the immigration service, said that if the board rejects the request for the stay of its \nbond order, the law and regulations are not clear on how much time the I.N.S. will have to make its appeal to the \nAttorney General or how long she will have to consider the appeal.\n\n\"Until the board decides the issue of the stay we requested, he will remain in our custody,\" Mr. Gilhooly said.\n\n      \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
