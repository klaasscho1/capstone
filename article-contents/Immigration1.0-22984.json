{"title": "Lawyer for senator's wife files complaint vs. notario", "body": "\nAn Atlanta immigration lawyer has filed a complaint with the Georgia Bar Association against a man he says could \nhave gotten his client deported because of shoddy paperwork.\n\nThe lawyer, Charles Kuck, is representing Sascha Thompson, the Colombian wife of state Sen. Curt Thompson. \nEarlier this week, a federal judge threw out a deportation order against Sascha Thompson after hearing evidence \nthat she was the victim of paperwork errors by a notario.\n\nIn many Latin American countries, \"notario publicos\" are respected members of the legal system --- at a level \nbetween lawyers and judges. But in the United States, the term translates to notary public, although the two jobs \nare not equivalent. \n\nAdvocates for immigrants say some Spanish speakers in the United States assume that those who advertise \nthemselves as notarios have the same legal authority here as they do abroad.\n\nKuck named Tomas Vilela of Norcross as the man who filed improper paperwork on behalf of Sascha Thompson, \nwho said she was trying to get help extending her student visa.\n\nLorraine Bell, a legal secretary in the Bar's Unlicensed Practice of Law Department, confirmed that a complaint had \nbeen filed.\n\nVilela declined to discuss the case Friday afternoon.\n\nUnder a state immigration law known as State Bill 529, notarios and others who provide immigration services must \npost signs at their business and in advertising that makes it clear if they are not a licensed lawyer.\n\nThis section of the law, which went into effect in April, also restricts the type of paperwork that nonlawyers may do \non behalf of immigrants.\n\nEach violation is subject to a $1,000 fine.\n\nPeople who pose as lawyers can face criminal charges resulting in a prison sentence.\n\n"}
