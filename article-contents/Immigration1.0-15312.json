Kyl, cont.: National Review has more gruesome details of the Senate's \"grand bargain\" on \nimmigration. It turns out that employers are specifically forbidden from requiring employees to pass the fancy new \nEEVS 'are-you-really-legal' check before going to work. Employers have to hire \"blind\" and then try to fire later, if \nthey get a \"nonconfirmation notice\" from the government--after all appeals and \"the period to timely file a petition for \njudicial review\" has passed. \n\nIt's always harder to fire someone than it is to not hire them in the first place. Plus, it looks to me as if the system \ngives even new, post-2007 illegal immigrants a free shot to go to work. If there's a backlog in the agency checking \n\n\nthe documents, they get to keep working. Then if, months down the road, their documents are rejected, they can \njust not show up for work one day and fade back into the 'shadows,' to try again later. Do you think the ICE is going \nto track them down? I don't. \n\nThat's a good deal, not for existing illegals--they don't have to worry about this at all, they'll be legalized!--but for \nfuture illegals, the ones still in Mexico and El Salvador, etc. who might want to come across the border in 2008 and \nthereafter. The bill's tough employer sanction system was supposed to deny them above-ground work \nopportunities, but it doesn't look like that will be the case. \n\nSen.

Of course the bill's \"architects\" are \ngoing to claim that senators were unfazed by the vociferous, mainly conservative opposition. They may be right, but \nif WaPo did more than buy their spin--if they even interviewed the other side--it's not evident here. ... P.S.: WaPo \ndoes provide some evidence that some objections from the left about the bill are mostly bluster--the head of the \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens basically admits as much.

I especially don't understand the argument, made by \nJason Riley in the televised meeting, that a program of legal guest workers will necessarily dramatically reduce the \nflow of illegals even absent effective border barriers.\n\nThe notion seems to be that if the economy \"needs\" 400,000 low wage workers, and you let in 300,000 legally, then \nonly 100,000 will come in illegally. But that assumes it's only the demand side of the equation that determines the \nflow, which I don't think is how markets work. There's also supply--how many workers want to come here, given \nstagnation, droughts, recessions, etc, in their homelands--and wages, which match supply with demand. If 800,000 \nare interested in coming here, and 300,000 come in legally, the other 500,000 aren't going to necessarily stay home \n(assuming, again, border enforcement is futile). They're going to come and bid down twages--raising the number of \nworkers U.S. employers want to hire. Eventually the wage will be so low that some of the 800,000 are discouraged \nand don't come. \n\nThe market might equilibrate at 500,000 (300,000 legals plus 200,000 illegals), or 600,000 (300,000 legals and \n300,000 illegals) or 700,000, or anywhere in between. But it won't necessarily stop at the preexisting job \"need\" \nlevel set by government bureaucrats. \n\nIt's as odd to see the editorial champions of markets ignore how markets work as it is to see the leading advocates \nof supply-side thinking ignore the supply side.

Why then, has Bush made himself \nconspicuous defending the immigration \"grand bargain.\" Answer: Because one of the insane, Chalabi-esque \nfantasies behind this bill is the idea that it will produce more net Latino votes for Republicans. In order to establish \nthis hitherto nonexistent GOP bond with Hispanics, Bush must cast himself as the Man Who Legalized the Illegals. \nHe needs his Abe Lincoln moment, or else all his reform has done is added millions of voters from a traditionally \nDemocratic immigrant group to the rolls. Hence, he has to become a prominent defender of the bill even if that \nmakes the bill less likely to pass. \n\nP.P.S.: The \"instant\" nature of the legalization seems also calculated to produce a Lincoln moment, a day of joyous \nemancipation, dancing and celebration in Aztlan that will be remembered in future decades.

What about the illegals who arrive after that? I'd thought it \nwas a good joke when Rich Lowry asked, \"What does McCain want to do, deport them all?\" But Clive Crook of \nNational Journal           argues the post-January illegals will almost immediately become a problem even if \neverything goes as planned:\n\nTens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of new illegal immigrants have arrived since then. Thus each \npassing month adds to the numbers that the law insists must be sent home -- and the number is going to keep on \nrising, even if the pace slows once the new border measures are up and running. ... [snip]\n\nSo consider. One of the things the bill purports to recognize is that mass deportation of the 12 million illegal \nimmigrants thought to be in the country is both impractical and undesirable (not least because of the effects on the \nU.S. economy). But is the mass deportation of, say, a million immigrants, or 2 million, much more practical or \ndesirable? This is the outcome that the bill implicitly envisages even if, in every other respect, all goes to plan. \nMultiply that by two, on a very conservative estimate, for the illegal immigrants already here who opt not to apply for \nlegal status under the terms of the new law. Add a hundred thousand a year, maybe, for new illegal immigrants who \nmanage to slip through even after the border has been strengthened. In other words, suppose the bill is enacted: \nTen years from now, what has been gained? \n\nTwo answers: \n\n1) Some post-January illegals won't find it hard to trump up the two documents--e.g., \"sworn affidavits from \nnonrelatives\"--necessary to pass as pre-January illegals. Problem solved! (As President Bush declared last week, \"      \n     There is a document forgery industry in America.\" Does he think it's going to go away because he gives them a \ndifferent set of documents to forge?)\n\n2) Of course the remaining post-January illegals won't be deported, any more than all the  current pre-January \nillegals will have to be deported if Congress doesn't pass the \"comprehensive\" bill. They will live \"in the shadows.\" \nThen, in 10 years, with millions of new illegal shadow-dwellers--way more the Crook's \"hundred thousand a year,\" if \nthings don't go according \"to plan\" but rather according to recent precedent--there will be responsible bipartisan \nproposals, which you would be a yahoo to oppose, for another semi-amnesty. Potential illegals know this, one \nreason why they will keep coming. (That's the pattern after amnesties, it seems). ...\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3217319&page=1\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/world/middleeast/27withdraw.html?ex=1337918400&en=357fc787c131360c&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2167180/&#murtha\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/washington/25wage.html?ex=1337745600&en=08dfc8fa327950a4&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss\nhttp://www.dailykos.com/search?offset=0&old_count=30&string=minimum+wage&type=story&sortby=relevance&search=Search&count=30&wayback=20160&wayfront=0\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2007/05/25/todayspaper/index.html#Front%20Page\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/05/donothing_democrats_quelle_sur.html\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2167180/&#minwage\nhttp://www.breitbart.tv/freelhurt.html\nhttp://www.drudgereport.com/\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/28/world/middleeast/28delta.html?ex=1338004800&en=3bc9909321d69f9b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss\nhttp://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmViN2Y4NzYyMmVlNzE4OWNiN2M0YTIwMWQ2NDUxOTQ=\nhttp://nationaljournal.com/crook.htm\nhttp://truthlaidbear.com/immigrationbill.php?page=156\nhttp://truthlaidbear.com/immigrationbill.php?page=156\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070524.html\nhttp://www.city-journal.org/html/eon2006-09-29hm.html\n\n\nPraxis Reminder: Should you wish to try to forestall this irrevocable legislative disaster (or encourage it, I guess) \nhere is a list of Senate phone numbers and email forms (via            Hewitt).

Here's the key question, which pulled a 67% \"favor\" response--\n\n63. Would you favor or oppose allowing illegal immigrants who came into the country before January to apply for a \nfour-year visa that could be renewed, as long as they pay a $5,000 fine, a fee, show a clean work record and pass \na criminal background check? [E.A.]\n\n1) The question says that if illegals pay the fine, the fee, etc. they can \"apply\" for a four year visa. That suggests \nthat even after the fine, etc. there is some discretion to turn down the \"application\"--the way other visa applications \nare turned down. No. In the proposals being considered, if you satisfy the fine, fee, and background check \nrequirements, etc., you get the visa. You don't get \"to apply.\" An ordinarily ill-informed respondent just hearing this \nquestion might easily think it was a whole other sort of program being considered--something like, 'Sure, they can \napply and we'll take the ones we want--and it's only for four years, so we can always deny the renewals.'\n\n2) A \"four-year visa that could be renewed\" sounds mighty temporary, sort of like a tourist visa or some other visas \nthat foreigners have. It's not. It can be renewed until the visa-holder dies. It's permanent. ... \n\nP.S.: Does the average poll respondent even know what a \"visa\" is? I'm not sure I do. Why not be honest and say \nsomething like, \"Would you favor giving them legal status that would allow them to stay and work in the country\"? \nInstead, the NYT-CBS pollsters adopted the deceptive euphemisms of the proposed law (which must have tested \nwell or else the proponents would have come up with other deceptive euphemisms). ... 5:40 P.M. link\n\nParanoia Update--Fox Edition: Allahpundit says I'm engaging in \"conspiracy fantasias\" in suggesting that Fox News \nChannel is carrying water for Bush (instead of conservatives) by avoiding too much immigration and amnesty talk \nin the runup to the Memorial Day weekend.

Maybe it makes more sense if you look at the Kabuki, and \nat the cumulative effect of alienating small blocs of senators: A killer amendment, in this theory, is an amendment \nthat it's hard for a majority of politicians to go on record against (even if they hate it) but that gives a large group of \nother politicians who'd secretly like to vote against the bill a defensible excuse for doing so.** ...\n\nIf readers know more about this \"killer amendment\" business, or have amendments to suggest, email me.

First, the debate in the Senate has focused on how to legalize the status of illegal aliens. For most \nAmericans, that's missing the point (just 29% of American voters see legalizing the status of illegal aliens as a Very \nImportant issue). \n\nSecond, there is enormous skepticism about the government commitment to enforcing the borders (as the Times \nsurvey noted, only 14% believe the government is doing all it can at this time). To most voters, immigration reform \nis all about border control. Until voters are convinced that the enforcement is both real and effective, there will be \nno popular support for reform. [E.A.]\n\nI tend to think the NYT's questionable Question #63 finding (see below) is a little more inconsistent with \nRasmussen's results than that. But Rasmussen's conclusion is similar to Andy McCarthy's--it's all about lack of \ntrust in the enforcement piece, and an unwillingness to take the \"big risk\" that \"the current 12 to 20+ million illegal \nalien population could easily swell to two or more times that amount if this isn't done right.\" ...\n\nP.S.: Here's what an actual pol says--\n\nSen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican negotiator who has come under heavy attack, conceded that a \nRasmussen poll showing just 26 percent of the voters surveyed favor passage of the Senate bill is probably \naccurate. [E.A.]\n\nOf course, Kyl's now posing as the courageous cooperator who's willing to tell his constituents to cram it.  A \nnegative poll result isn't off message for him.** Still ...\n\n**--It's the Reverse Howell Raines Fallacy: The great and good American people are wrong and we need \nbrave Beltway politicians to stand up to them.

The public clearly \ndoesn't like mass deportation, so two questions later, when they're asked in detail about the \"Z-visa,\" they may be \ninclined to approve. A fair poll would give respondents the option of leaving the status quo alone--letting illegals \nstay in the shadows, etc.\n\nb) I don't think it's fresh news that when voters are given elaborate descriptions of the requirements for semi-\namnesty (\"pay a $5,000 fine, a fee, show a clean work record and pass a criminal background check\") they say, \n'sure'. No other alternatives are given in this question.\n\nc) As the Times itself notes, it never asked voters simply what they thought of, say, 'the bill being considered by the \nSenate.' Voters may have heard descriptions of the bill that cast it in a positive or negative light. It's that bill and \nthose descriptions the Senators are going to be responsible for, not a NYT hypothetical not-quite-the-bill. ... Indeed, \nbefore the NYT poll asks voters Question #63, it softens them up by floating a legalization proposal (in \nQuestion #61) that's significantly different from--and tougher than--the Senate bill. The senate bill doesn't just give \nillegals \"a chance to ... eventually apply for legal status\".  It immediately gives them legal status. The bill doesn't \napply to \"most\" illegals (implying some sort of screening process). It applies to virtually all illegals. And,            as \nKrikorian notes, it doesn't apply to illegals who have \"lived and worked in the United States for at least two years.\" \nIt applies to all who snuck into the country before the beginning of 2007--five months ago.\n\nd) Point (c) is especially a problem because while voters may--let's use hypothetical numbers--approve of all the \nmain provisions by a 60-30 margin, that doesn't mean they approve of the compromise combining those provisions. \nIf the 30 percent who oppose the semi-amnesty provision are a different 30 percent than the 30 percent who \noppose the guest worker program, and they all feel adamant about it, then it's possible 60 percent oppose the \ncompromise that includes both provisions, no?\n\nSee also Allahpundit's analysis, and            pollster Scott Rasmussen's. ... Update: Also            Mark Krikorian. ...\n\nP.S.: It's also possible, of course, that the majority of voters foolishly do support the Senate compromise. I don't \nwant to slip into the Howell Raines Fallacy of assuming the great and good American people must agree with me. \nThe great and good American people are sometimes naive, ill-informed, or just all wet. But I don't think the NYT \npoll demonstrates that, in this case. ... 2:19 A.M. link\n\nBig Dirty Ball of Mischief! Peggy Noonan:\n\nNaturally I hope the new immigration bill fails.

Why shouldn't foreigners who legally come here to work eventually have a chance to become full-\nfledged citizens? That's different than rewarding with instant legalization those who came here illegally.

I wasn't saying that the most legitimate left wing objections to the Kyl-\nKennedy scheme--e.g., that it will unleash an un-blockable tide of amnesty-seeking illegals who will further bid \ndown wages for lower-skilled Americans, increasing income inequality--are necessarily what can derail the plan. \nThe Democratic objections that might derail it are mostly other sorts of objections, of the we-want-the-whole-loaf-\nand-think-we-can-get-it-in-2009 variety--lower fees for the \"Z visa,\" more \"chain migration,\" no guest worker \nprogram, etc. ... The liberal demands that derailed the Nixon guaranteed income plan weren't demands I have \nmuch sympathy for (\"You can't force me to work,\" said a welfare mother to applause at a FAP-related hearing in \n1970).

Just as defeating FAP set the stage for a better plan also rejected by purists of left and right--the \n1996 welfare reform that stressed work over guarantees of cash--defeating Kyl-Kennedy can set the stage for a \nbetter bipartisan plan (stressing effective enforcement measures before guaranteeing semi-amnesty). ...

Could they mess up more?\" 4:29 A.M.\n\nGOP Immigration Cave-In, Part II: The GOP's lead Senate negotiator, Sen. Jon Kyl, appears to have caved on the \ncrucial issue of legalization (for existing illegal immigrants) in exchange for a promise of tougher enforcement to \nprevent another, future wave of illegals. \n\nUnfortunately, the legalization in the Senate's compromise would be immediate--see below. The \"enforcement\" \npart would follow, in the form,            WaPo reports, of \"18,000 new Border Patrol agents and four unmanned aerial \nvehicles,\" etc. There appears to be no requirement that these added assets would actually accomplish the job of \npreventing more illegal immigration. At least in Iraq Bush is asking to be judged by the result of his surge, not by his \nmere deployment of more troops.\n\nIt's not even clear the new agents will be assigned to enforce the immigration laws. Here is a CNN report, \nciting Homeland Security Sec. Michael Chertoff on the subject: \n\nBut Chertoff told CNN that the bill would help him better focus his resources.\n\n\"Right now, I've got my Border Patrol agents and my immigration agents chasing maids and landscapers. I want \nthem to focus on drug dealers and terrorists. It seems to me, if I can get the maids and landscapers into a regulated \nsystem and focus my law enforcement on the terrorists and the drug dealers, that's how I get a safe border.\"\n\nHmm. Future illegal immigrants will be \"maids and landscapers\" too. Is Chertoff going to use the Border Patrol to \nlook for them (and their law-breaking employers) or is he going to pull Border Patrol agents off the immigration beat \nin order to put them on the anti-drug smuggling and terrorism beats?  If the Bush Administration is going to try to \nappease foes of legalization with a show of \"enforcement\" muscle, it could at least get its story straight. ... \n\nP.S.: Good Rich Lowry line--\n\nBut the 12 million illegals here before January would get probationary legal status immediately when the bill \npasses. Effectively, that's amnesty. (It's unclear why illegals arriving here after January would be excluded so \ncoldheartedly.

Something to encourage those who oppose the Kyl-Kennedy compromise GOP cave-in on \nimmigration: This is a complex bill, with provisions opposed by the right (e.g., instant legalization) and provisions \nopposed by the left (e.g., a temporary guest worker program, potential shift toward favoring immigrants with skills \nmore and family members less). It's not uncommon for a bill to ultimately fail because it loses votes on both ends**-\n-some legislators don't think it's \"liberal\" enough and some don't think it's \"conservative\" enough--even though the \nobjections are contradictory. That's what happened, for example, in 1972 to Nixon's Family Assistance Plan (FAP)--\na \"grand bargain\" that would have replaced welfare with a guaranteed income. FAP is eerily similar to Kyl-Kennedy: \nit too was a faux-solution to a big problem. It too was endorsed by virtually the entire respectable MSM-\npolitical establishment (and promoted by a president weakened by an unpopular war!). But it lost when faced with a \nstrange bedfellows alliance of conservatives who didn't like the idea of guaranteeing everyone cash benefits and \nliberals who didn't think the benefits were generous enough. And after FAP lost, it went away and never came back. \nIt's not inconceivable that the same thing will happen to Kyl-Kennedy ... \n\nP.S.: And that's not even considering the many \"left\" objections that are in fact the same as the \"right\" objections--\ne.g., that the bill, by encouraging another flood of illegals, will drive down the wages of unskilled Americans. \n...

The Corner investigates and discusses the gruesome details of the Kyl \ncave-in on immigration as they emerge. According to Rich Lowry, despite all the            deceptive rhetoric about a \n \"borders first\" approach, current illegal immigrants would apparently get            an immediate \"probationary\" card, \nmaking them immediately legal. That is why Sen. Kennedy (who supports legalization) could boast, at            the \npress conference on the deal, that \n\nIf this bill becomes law, it will provide an historic opportunity for millions of people right away. [E.A.]\n\nP.S.:  Captain Ed loyally defends the deal in what may be one of the most unconvincing blog posts ever! \n\nHere's the problem with the hard-liner arguments, which amounts to \"they'll never engage the border-security and \nworkplace enforcement portions.\" Well, that could be true of any immigration bill, even if it completely matched the \nconservative position on immigration. It's an argument that only supports no action whatsoever on illegal \nimmigration, including border controls. \n\nThat's silly. You could pass \"the border-security and workplace enforcement portions\" and then see if they worked--\nand tightened them if they didn't--before you went ahead with amnesty. ... Lowry, meanwhile, defends Sen. Kyl, \nalso unconvincingly. If Kyl had walked away from negotiations, would he really not bring along 39 other votes to \nblock a \"much worse\" bill? There doesn't have to be a bill, remember. Bipartisan cooperative \"action\" isn't \nnecessarily always a great thing (as the 1986 amnesty showed). The country is not in crisis, only Bush. The no-bill \nstatus quo,            Lowry's own magazine notes, has been moving in a good direction on immigration, with greater \nenforcement (and rising wages at the bottom). ...\n\nP.P.S.: Heather Mac Donald predicts the effect of the immediate legalization will be to encourage more illegal \nimmigrants to come here and create new 'facts on the ground' that will then have to be humanely and \ncompassionately accommodated in another, future amnesty:\n\nThere is no ambiguity about the effects of amnesty. Everywhere they have been introducedincluding in Europethey \nhave brought in their train a new flood of illegals.  \n\nThis latest bill will do the same.\n\nProf. Borjas agrees: \"After all, what guarantees that the current batch of 12 million illegal immigrants will not be \nreplaced by another 12 million in just a few years?\" He makes the (apt!) Iraq analogy:\n\nThe bill neatly summarizes the intellectual flimsiness of the Bush administration  a flimsiness that has cost us dearly \nin so many other areas. Perhaps they can convince themselves otherwise; that legalizing the status of illegal \nimmigrants is not an amnesty; that the laws of supply and demand can be repealed when it comes to immigration \n...\n\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDViNDNiZjQzMDEyNDNlNWIxNTljNTVlZDJkY2NhNWQ=\nhttp://ace.mu.nu/archives/226848.php\nhttp://ace.mu.nu/archives/226848.php\nhttp://www.instapundit.com/\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2166199/&#fightfap\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/\nhttp://headingright.com/2007/05/16/immigration-compromise-nears-readiness/\nhttp://headingright.com/2007/05/16/immigration-compromise-nears-readiness/\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzYyYWU1MGMzNDlkOWJkNzQ0MDE3NjAwNmE5YmFkZTI=\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051701518.html?hpid=topnews\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051701518.html?hpid=topnews\nhttp://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/010002.php\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTUxZjY4ZGVjMDg1NjFjNjRmMDAzYmQ1Y2VjYjQzYzA=\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTUxZjY4ZGVjMDg1NjFjNjRmMDAzYmQ1Y2VjYjQzYzA=\nhttp://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjZkOTAzNDEzYmUyYzllNTA0NjRmZTk4YjFjM2U1Zjc=\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OWMwNDIyNjBmNDRjMTNjYWM3ODg5ZWU0OTZiMTMyZjg=\nhttp://www.city-journal.org/html/eon2006-09-29hm.html\nhttp://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzQ1YTE0YjBmOTkzMTczOWNmMzIyZDc0NzgxY2ZkOGM=\n\n\nAnd that the millions of new citizens from Latin America will be Republicans. ...\n\nP.P.P.S.: Lowry says Senate insiders predict 70+ votes for the compromise.

Even if we could, and even if that were desirable, and even if the provisions survived in the \nDemocratic house, it would hardly be worth what the GOP senators have apparently agreed to: taking the risk of \nencouraging another 12 million illegals to evade our still-porous border controls and wait for the next amnesty. ... \nThis is looking more and more like the Bush administration's domestic version of Iraq: a big risky gamble, based on \nwishful thinking and nonexistent administrative competence, that will end in disaster. What disaster? 1) Lower \nwages for struggling unskilled--and semi-skilled--American workers (including, especially, underclass men) even \nwhen the labor market should be tight; 2) Income inequality moving further in the direction of Latin America--maybe \neven to such an extent that social equality between the rich and their servers becomes difficult to maintain; and 3) A \nlarge semi-assimilated population along our southern border with complex, understandably binational allegiances--\nour own Quebec. ...

The complete amnesty will be delayed until ... what? Until the borders are actually controlled, or \nuntil the government merely makes a specified attempt to bring the borders under control? Here's Pear:\n\nMajor provisions of the bill being developed in the Senate would not take effect unless the president first certified \nthat he had hired more Border Patrol agents and taken other steps to beef up enforcement of immigration laws at \nthe border and in the workplace. [E.A.]\n\nThat sure sounds like it's input, not output, that \"triggers\" the amnesty provisions.\n\n2) Immediate legalization?  As Mark Krikorian predicted, even before the \"triggers\" are triggered, it seems illegal \nimmigrants would get \"special 'Z visas,' allowing them to stay here for an initial period of four years.\" Really eight \nyears, according to WaPo. In other words, immediate legalization. No wonder amnesty advocate Tamar Jacoby       \n     confidently asserts, \"The fight over legalization, or 'amnesty,' is all but over.\"  ...  Other clues that the legalization \nprovision is very liberal: The National Immigration Forum spokesperson praises it \"very good, much better than the \none in the bill passed by the Senate last year.\" And, according to WaPo, \"the National Council of La Raza, the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Immigration Forum are virtually being \ngranted veto power over\" the bill by Sen. Ted Kennedy. [E.A.]\n\n3) Misguided focus on guest workers? Instead of working to block a massive legalization of illegals--likely to only \nencourage the next generation of illegals to test our border controls--the \"conservative\" point man, Sen. John Kyl, \nappears to have focused on punishing over foreign citizens who come here legally under a new guest worker \nprogram.\n\n\"Temporary must mean temporary,\" said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the principal Republican negotiator. \"A \ntemporary worker program should be for temporary workers, not for aliens who wish to become United States \ncitizens.\"\n\nWhy shouldn't aliens who come her legally as guest workers have a path to citizenship? Isn't that an incentive we \nwant to offer those who bother to go the legal route? Do we want a two-tier work force? La Raza's Cecilia Munoz \nhas a point when she says \"Senator Kyl's approach is contrary to our history as a nation of immigrants.\"\n\nIn politics, it's always harder to screw people who are already in place, marching. lobbying, and complaining --i.e. \nexisting illegals--than it is to screw people who haven't yet come here and don't even know who they are (potential \nfuture guest workers). But in this case it's the people-in-place who've broken the law. They're the ones who need to \nbe stiff-armed. Instead, Kyl seems to be acceding to an unjustified amnesty for illegals-in-place while letting \nconservatives get bought off by equally unjustified restrictions on future guest workers. Easy politics, terrible policy.\n\nIs Kyl even trying to get a better bill? Or is he trying to get a better fig leaf to help sell conservatives Bush's bill? ...\n\n**--It's risky to rely on Pear! He's honest, but he's almost always a captive of his liberal interest group sources. In \ntoday's article, for example, he quotes only the objections of pro-legalization figures (from the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, La Raza, and the National Immigration Forum, a \"pro immigrant advocacy group\"). No \n\"enforcement first\" advocates make it into the piece. I don't think it's that Pear doesn't want their views--it's that the \nliberal interest groups are the people he is talking to all the time. They inevitably influence what he writes about, and \nwhat he writes about what he writes about.  He's constantly soaking in a liberal interest group bath!

If conservatives keep rubbing the Dem Congress' low poll ratings           in its face, Nancy Pelosi \nmight be tempted to counter the \"do nothing\" image by ... passing \"comprehensive immigration reform,\" which most \nconservatives disdain. ... \n\nOf course, some Republicans also desperately want an immigration bill to \"get the issue off the table\" before the \nelections. (Hugh Hewitt, this means you.) Fortunately, National Review has not joined them--and instead produced \na            calm and sensible editorial. They're not the ones running around            calling people \"yahoos\"! Key NR \ngraf:\n\nAnother false premise is that the various components of \"comprehensive immigration reform\" must go together. The \npresident expressed this view most recently in last weekend's radio address: \"We must address all elements of this \nproblem together, or none of them will be solved at all.\" Why? There is no reason not to pass enhanced \nenforcement measures now and turn to the status of remaining illegal aliens later. [E.A.]\n\nThe supposed linkage between increased enforcement and semi-amnesty is not dissimilar to the linkage between \ndeposing Saddam Hussein and fighting Al Qaeda: weak, yet constantly repeated by the Bush Administration as a \nrhetorical device to sell a preconceived (and misguided) grand plan! It's their M.O.. The difference is that now \nconservatives are on to them too. ...\n\nP.S.: There's an obvious contradiction lurking here.Powerline agrees that passing immigration reform would help \nDemocrats by countering the 'do-nothing' charge. But the Republicans who are desperate to get the issue 'off the \ntable' seem to feel a bill would help Republicans (largely, I'm told, by ending a divisive intraparty debate in which \nGOP hardliners inevitably alienate moderate swing voters with their harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric). They can't both \nbe right. Control of Congress and of the White House is a zero sum game. Either a bill helps the GOPs or the \nDems. Which is it? That's why I'm nervous, despite            Mark Krikorian's assurances. What if Pelosi concludes \nit's in her interest--even hershort term, win-in-2008 interest--to move a bill even without 70 or 50 Republican votes \nas cover? ... P.P.S.: It's more obviously in Pelosi's long term interest to pass a semi-amnesty bill, since millions of \nnew Hispanic voters are likely to be mainly Democrats even if the GOPs slightly increase their share. ...  3:28 P.M.\n\n Instapundit  and            Bob Krumm argue we've seen a breathtaking demonstration of Fred Thompson's campaign \npotential in            this instantly produced and reasonably effective (in the good cheap shot sense) anti-Michael \nMoore video. ... Krumm is right that it's the sort of thing Hillary's ponderous campaign would have trouble matching. \nI think a clip like this only has a big tactical impact, though, if it gets picked up by the TV networks and starts driving \nthe whole MSM--proliferation on the Web isn't enough, yet.  But it's hard to see how the nets will be able to resist \nfree video from a cigar-chomping Thompson. ... More important, I think: quite apart from its advantages as a \ncampaign tool, the video is itself evidence of Thompson's actual presidential qualifications. You can't make a \nquickie spot like this unless a) you know what you think (or have a really fast pollster) b) you can react to new \nsituations quickly, and c) you have some sense of theater.

Wasn't that a triumph of ... er, salesmanship for Eaton \nand Lutz?\n\n2) But Kitman rightly points to Mercedes' abject failure to get Chrysler to produce good new cars.

It basically would have            offered legalization to illegal \nimmigrants who'd been here for two years or more--but this compromise was too restrictive for Richardson:\n\nRewind 10 hours. It's 8:15 a.m. and Richardson is running late. \n\nAs a state patrolman pushes the governor's Ford hybrid sport utility vehicle toward 90 mph, coaxing it to an \nunnatural whine, Richardson punches buttons on one of his three cellphones. \n\nHe calls an aide and discusses potential fundraising events in April and May with Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

John Corzine, has a significant speed addiction,            according to \nRadley Balko:\n\nIn 2003, The Washington Post reported that New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson routinely ordered his driver to whip \ndown public roads at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour. Even after those reports, when a police officer \nattempted to pull over Richardson's car for speeding in 2005, the governor's driver refused to stop. ...[snip]\n\nFor his part, Richardson refused to apologize for his law-breaking. He said he'd instruct his drivers to slow down, \nbut cited his busy schedule as governor and said he wouldn't promise not to speed again.            By April 2006, his \ncar was seen pushing 90 again.. ...\n\nIsn't this a pretty basic violation of social equality? You'd think liberal egalitarians would be as offended as anyone \nat the sense \"among many elected officials that their job is so important, their time so much more precious than \nours and their position in public life so privileged, that they can zip by us on the road, pushing everyday folk aside \nso they can get to their far more important destinations.\"  ... \n\nhttp://www.observer.com/node/39607\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-alter/how-radar-sideswip_b_48165.html\nhttp://bloggingheads.tv/video.php?id=223&cid=1155&in=62:53\nhttp://bloggingheads.tv/video.php?id=223&cid=1155&in=62:53\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2166199/&#fogeys\nhttp://radaronline.com/features/2007/05/mike_gravel_presidential_campaign_2.php\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-alter/how-radar-sideswip_b_48165.html\nhttp://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2007/05/an-open-letter-to-jonathan-alter.php\nhttp://www.samefacts.com/archives/the_wayward_press_/2007/05/edsalls_irony.php\nhttp://www.samefacts.com/archives/the_wayward_press_/2007/05/edsalls_irony.php\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2165717/&#alterhuff\nhttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0307/3054.html\nhttp://reason.com/news/show/120125.html\nhttp://reason.com/news/show/120125.html\nhttp://www.freenewmexican.com/news/29401.html\nhttp://blogs.scripps.com/albq/state/2006/04/governor_still_speeding.html\nhttp://blogs.scripps.com/albq/state/2006/04/governor_still_speeding.html\n\n\nP.S.: \"Zip\"--there's that word again!

There have been wild and significant doings at Locke. A            majority of \nthe school's teachers have signed petitions supporting the school's conversion of into a group of smaller charter \nschools (under the aegis of charter entrepreneur Steve Barr's Green Dot organization). The central school district \nbureaucracy apparently then struck back at Wells, who was \"escorted off campus and relieved of his duties late \nTuesday afternoon pending the outcome of a district investigation into allegations that Wells allowed teachers to \nleave their classrooms to collect and sign petitions.\" [E.A.] ...

If the problem with Locke is \nlack of \"quality teachers,\" then who are the teachers who are signing the petition to become part of a charter \nschool?  Are they the good Locke teachers or the bad Locke teachers?\n\nAs usual, it's especially hard to discern exactly what's going on reading the LAT's account because the paper's \ntediously dull, formal, \"neutral\" style gets in the way of actually comprehending the forces at work. Here's the \nTimes:\n\nUnderscoring the anxiety and anger the plan is unleashing within the district, Locke Principal Frank Wells was \nescorted off campus and relieved of his duties late Tuesday afternoon ... [snip]\n\nWells called the charges \"a total fabrication,\" saying no classes were disrupted as teachers signed and collected \nsignatures during non-class time. Teachers who helped collect signatures supported Wells' version of events. [E.A.]\n\nI think the vague boldfaced words are journalistic code for something like this:\n\nTerrified by the threat that if a big ghetto high school like Locke secedes the entire union-supported city schools \nbureaucracy might collapse like the East German government at the end of Lives of Others--and angered that Wells \nwould even talk to the Green Dot charter people (in front of U.S. Education Secretary Spellings, no less)-- the \nschool district's bureaucratic blob immediately and crudely retaliated against him by trumping up charges ...\n\nBut I'm not sure!  ...

The L.A.T.'sreporter was \nsubsequently blocked from entering the Locke campus, and the            paper's education blog isn't happy about it. \nGood to see passion of any sort at the Times, even if it's in defense of special press rights--sorry, I mean \"the \npublic's right to know.\" [via           L.A.
