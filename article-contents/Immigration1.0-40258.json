{"title": "Female Circumcision an Issue in Deportation", "body": "\nA Nigerian woman went before federal immigration officials today to plead that she be allowed to stay in the United \nStates to protect her two daughters from female circumcision. The case is believed to be the first in which the \nprospect of the ancient rite has been raised in an effort to block deportation.\n\nIf officials decide to deport the woman, Lydia Oluloro, she would have to either give up her daughters, Shade, 6, \nand Lara, 4, or take them back to Nigeria where they face almost certain mutilation of their sexual organs, said \nJanet Estoup, a paralegal working on Oluloro's defense.\n\n\"Every woman in her family has been circumcised,\" said Estoup. \"She has been told by her family that her children \nwill be cut because 'we don't want any American whores running around to embarrass the family.' \" Oluloro faces \ndeportation because her ex-husband, Emanuel Oluloro, a legal U.S. resident, failed to file a spousal petition to \nlegalize her residency.\n\nThe painful operation, often done without anesthetic, involves the cutting away of the clitoris or the inner lips of the \nvagina. The procedure, which frequently causes infections and other complications, is common in parts of Africa, \nthe Middle East and Southeast Asia, and occurs occasionally in the United States, mainly to children born of African \nparents.\n\nOluloro, 32, grew up in Nigeria's Yoruba tribe and underwent circumcision as a child. She said she believed it was \na proper custom until she moved to the United States.\n\nShe said sexual problems resulting from the operation helped destroy her marriage and asked for a suspension of \nthe deportation order on grounds of \"extreme hardship.\"\n\nOluloro's former husband, who wants custody of the girls, has told reporters he opposes female circumcision and \nbelieves his wife's claim is \"a tactic that her lawyer is using.\"\n"}
