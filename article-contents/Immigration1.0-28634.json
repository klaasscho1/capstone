{"title": "A Long Walk For a Cause", "body": "\nFour immigrant students arrived at the White House on Wednesday  after walking from Miami to raise support for \nlegislation to open a path to legal status for students who are illegal immigrants.\n\n  The students, Juan Rodriguez, 20, Felipe Matos, 24, Gaby Pacheco, 25, and Carlos Roa, 22, started walking on \nJan. 1, hoping to press Congress to adopt a bill known by its supporters at the Dream Act. Mr. Roa and Mr. Matos  \ndo not have legal status.\n\n  Last week, the bill's sponsors, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Richard G. Lugar,  \nRepublican of Indiana,  wrote a letter asking President Obama to suspend deportations of students who are illegal \nimmigrants. The bill would give legal status to immigrants who arrived in the United States at age 15 or younger.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO: From left, Carlos Roa, Gaby Pacheco, Felipe Matos and Juan Rodriguez in Washington.
