{"title": "Pro and Con HIV exclusion policy is reasonable", "body": "\nWASHINGTON - The Clinton administration has informed Americans that it will propose dropping HIV infection from \nthe list of diseases that exclude affected aliens from entering the United States.\n\nThe Senate responded by passing, 76-23, legislation to ensure that aliens infected with the AIDS virus will not be \nadmitted as permanent residents of the United States.\nThe legislation also provides that the restriction may be waived for visitors who come to visit relatives, to seek \nmedical treatment, to attend conferences or for other short-term purposes. In addition, there has always been in the \nlaw a waiver for immigrants who come to join close family members here.\n\nAIDS is an illness that can result in medical costs of $ 100,000 or more for each patient, according to estimates. It \nseems likely that alien HIV-infected persons may become \"public charges\" after their admission to the United \nStates. For this reason, the American Medical Association has opposed the admission of such persons into the \nUnited States as permanent immigrants.\n\nThe Senate-passed legislation provides for a thorough study by the administration of the potential health-care costs \nof admitting immigrants infected with the AIDS virus. The Senate is also to study the issues before we change our \npolicy. There is much work and education of the public yet to be done here. Believe it.\n\nAlan Simpson is a Republican senator from Wyoming. This article appeared first in The Washington Post.\n"}
