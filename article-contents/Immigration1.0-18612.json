{"title": "Kean Is Striving For a Conservative Look", "body": "\nAlthough Tom Kean Jr. was in the news for his opposition to the Bush administration's port deal, he has directed \nmuch of his political energy in recent days toward establishing his credentials with conservative voters, whose \nsupport will be crucial in his bid for the United States Senate.\n\n  He came out in support of the nomination of Samuel A. Alito Jr. as a Supreme Court justice and then aggressively \ncriticized his senatorial opponent, Robert Menendez, for opposing it.\n\nAnd in an interview with Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, he advocated making the president's tax cuts \npermanent and declared his support for the war in Iraq. \n\n  Still, unfortunately for Mr. Kean, a personable and generally moderate state senator from Westfield, some New \nJersey conservatives are still firmly on the fence about him. ''Illegal immigration, abortion and gun rights,'' said \nSteve Lonegan, the proudly right-wing Republican mayor of Bogota who ran for governor last year. ''How he does \non those issues will be the real test. Those other things were the easy lifts.''    JOSH BENSON\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
