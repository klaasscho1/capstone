{"title": "When a College Is Out of Reach", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n\"Pricing the Poor Out of College\" (editorial, March 27) doesn't mention a significant reason many low-income \nstudents don't get Pell grants: they aren't citizens and don't have permanent resident status.\n\n     Federal rules prohibit granting student financial aid to undocumented immigrants, even if they have lived here for \nyears, learned the language and performed at the top of their class in high school. \n\n Federal law also sets a standard for state schools that imposes higher, out-of-state tuition on such students.\n\nThese students will likely live the balance of their lives in the United States. Higher education makes a huge \ndifference in lifetime earning power. We should encourage immigrants to go to college, not thwart their efforts.\n\nRONAY MENSCHEL\n\nNew York, March 28, 2002\n\nThe writer is a vice chairman of the board of Cornell University.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nDrawing (Jim Frazier)\n"}
