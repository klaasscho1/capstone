Zell Miller \nagreeing to remove from Georgia prisons some 300 criminals who are either in the United States illegally or who, \nthrough criminal acts, have forfeited their right to remain in this country.\n\nCalling the joint agreement \"the next step in ridding our state of criminals and saving the taxpayers money,\" Miller \nsaid the transfer of foreign nationals out of the state's prisons will save more than $ 5 million a year.\n\nDeporting the criminals also will open up needed space in prisons that are rapidly approaching the saturation point, \nCorrections Commissioner Allen Ault said.\n\nThe joint agreement is part of an INS initiative, \"Operation Southpaw,\" that began Monday with the detention and \ndeportation of 150 undocumented workers from four Atlanta job sites. On Tuesday, federal agents detained an \nadditional 100 foreign nationals at job sites in Chamblee, Hapeville, Kennesaw, Lithonia and Atlanta.\n\nAs a result of the joint agreement, the state Pardons and Parole Board will begin releasing to the INS for \ndeportation state inmates with drug, theft and burglary convictions, state officials said.\n\nAlthough the INS has for years had the authority to deport state inmates, the agency only detained convicts after \nthey were paroled, said board Chairman Wayne Garner, and there was no guarantee they would remain in custody \nuntil they were deported.\n\nGarner said he suspects the INS is now responding to political pressure generated by growing national concerns \nabout illegal aliens. \"The INS is getting with the program,\" he said.\n"}
