{"title": "Nazi Propagandist Missing at Hearing; May Have Fled U.S.", "body": "\nA former Yale University lecturer who was stripped of his United States citizenship for his role as a propagandist \nfor the Nazis in World War II, has failed to attend a deportation hearing, and members of his family said today that \nthey believe he has fled the country.\n\nThe former lecturer, Vladimir Sokolov, 75 years old, did not show up at the deportation hearing in Hartford Friday.\nHis stepdaughter, Irene Moroz, said he may be in Europe. She said she last saw Mr. Sokolov in March.\n\nMr. Sokolov's son-in-law, George Moroz, said he last spoke to Mr. Sokolov was about three months ago. He said \nMr. Sokolov avoided the hearing because he feared being deported to his native Soviet Union.\n\nHe said his father-in-law has friends in Europe, Australia and Canada.\n\nJoseph F. Lynch, trial attorney for the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigation, said that he was not \nsurprised by Mr. Sokolov's absence and that Mr. Sokolov's friends and neighbors had said he was no longer in the \ncountry.\n\nJudge Thomas L. Pullen of the Immigration and Naturalization Service gave Mr. Lynch 30 days to provide a brief \nsupporting the deportation.\n\nJudge Pullen said he will also allow Mr. Sokolov 30 days to respond.\n\nJudge Thomas F. Murphy of Federal District Court in Hartford stripped Mr. Sokolov of his citizenship in June 1986, \nsaying he had concealed his Nazi background from immigration officials.\n\nMr. Sokolov was a writer and editor for Rech, a Nazi-controlled, Russian-language newspaper, during 1942 and \n1943. He had testified that his articles were altered without his knowledge, but the Federal Government had \nportrayed him as a Nazi who wrote ''vicious attacks against the Jews'' during World War II.\n"}
