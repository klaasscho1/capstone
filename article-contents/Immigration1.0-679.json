{"title": "Guest Worker Programs Do a World of Harm;Native-Born Displaced", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"Foreign Workers, American Dream\" (Op-Ed, June 1): Julian L. Simon, in his plea for a renewed \"bracero\" \nguest-worker program, quotes the leading scholar in the field, George J. Borjas of the University of California at \nSan Diego, as saying there is \"no evidence\" that immigration adversely affects native-born earnings.\n\nBut Mr. Borjas has subsequently concluded that such evidence does exist (see his \"Economics of Immigration\" in \nlast December's Journal of Economic Literature). Mr. Simon should remember this, because I pointed it out to him \nwhen we debated my book \"Alien Nation: Common Sense About America's Immigration Disaster\" at a National \nReview Institute conference.\n\nI also pointed out that in Mr. Simon's book \"The Economic Consequences of Immigration,\" he repeatedly concedes \nthat while immigrants may make more jobs than they take in aggregate, they do displace specific groups of native-\nborn Americans. And there is no guarantee that the groups displaced get the benefits.\n\nNevertheless, I applaud Mr. Simon's courage in proposing a guest-worker program (which I endorse). For too \nmany on both left and right, immigration policy is a sacred cow. By blindly dismissing any reform effort as \"racist,\" \nthese immigration enthusiasts make public explosion inevitable.\n\n \n\nPETER BRIMELOW\n\nNew York, June 1, 1995\n\nThe writer is a senior editor at Forbes magazine.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nDrawing.\n"}
