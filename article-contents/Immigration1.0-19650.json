{"title": "They Said Immigration Could Be Fixed", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n  ''It's the President's Turn'' (editorial, April 9) speaks of the need for President Bush to lay out specifics for resolving \nthe immigration impasse. But it does not appear as if Mr. Bush has much, if any, credibility left -- and certainly not \nin an amount sufficient to move the House or the Senate in any particular direction.\n\nWhile polls leave many basic questions unanswered, they reflect public opinion at the moment, and in this case, a \nsubstantial majority of the public wants the borders closed to any further illegal crossing. \n\n  Unless and until a final legislative proposal includes effective, enforceable means of preventing illegal entry into \nthe United States, there will not be support by voters for any measure that offers a path to legal presence for those \nwho are here now illegally.\n\nFrederick M.
