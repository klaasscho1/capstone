{"title": "757 Haitians may have political asylum eligibility", "body": "\nThe State Department said Monday that 757 of the 6,620 Haitian refugees picked up by U.S. vessels since the \nSeptember coup in Haiti have plausible grounds for seeking political asylum. Department spokeswoman Margaret \nTutwiler said 4,593 Haitians had been interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization Service officials.\nOf those with plausible asylum grounds, 212 have been flown to the USA to make their cases. The rest will follow \nshortly, Tutwiler said. The United States plans to return most of the refugees to Haiti but has been prevented by a \ncourt order issued by a federal judge in Florida. In the meantime, the refugees are being housed at the \nGuantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, in tents on a abandoned airfield, and aboard Coast Guard vessels.\n\n WHITE HOUSE VISIT: Nobel Prize-winning missionary Mother Teresa visited President Bush and gave him an \nupdate on her recent charity work in Albania. The 10-minute meeting ''was very cordial,'' said presidential \nspokesman Gary Foster. ''The president appreciated her visit.'' Mother Teresa established five mission clinics in \nAlbania and hopes to open similar facilities in China, Foster said. The 81-year-old Roman Catholic nun was in \nWashington to witness the induction of 27 nuns into the Missionaries of Charity order, which she founded in 1950.\n\nNotes\n\nWASHINGTON AND THE WORLD\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO; b/w, USA TODAY\n\n \n\nCUTLINE: MOTHER TERESA: Visited with Bush\n"}
