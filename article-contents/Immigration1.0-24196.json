{"title": "Immigration compromise collapses Sting for Bush \u2022 Bill was major domestic priority.", "body": "\nPresident George W. Bush suffered a devastating setback on his top domestic priority Thursday as a broad \nimmigration bill fell through in the Senate amid an irreconcilable partisan standoff.\n\nThe 627-page bill was taken off the Senate floor at the end of a bitterly contentious day that saw the bill's sponsors \ndesperately trying to resolve differences between Democrats and Republicans over GOP demands to offer \nadditional amendments.\n\nSenators, for the second time in a span of hours, voted overwhelmingly Thursday night against a motion to cut off \ndebate, prompting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to pull the bill. But Reid and Senate Minority Leader \nMitch McConnell, R-Ky., both declined to proclaim the bill dead and expressed hope of resuming work on the bill if \nthey find a way out of the deadlock.\n\nThe prospects for reviving and ultimately passing the bill appeared uncertain, but supporters insisted it could be \ndone.\n\n\"We're still open for business on this bill,\" said Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a leading Republican supporter \nof the measure.\n\nCrafted by a bipartisan group of senators after three months of negotiations with the White House, the bill seeks to \nlegalize millions of undocumented immigrants, create a temporary guest worker program, toughen security along \nthe U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada, and crack down on employers who hire illegal workers.\n\nBush, who has called for immigration changes since the outset of his presidency, has aggressively committed his \nadministration to passing the bill, even criticizing Republicans who denounce it.\n\nIf the bill isn't revived, it would mark the president's second defeat on the issue within the span of a year and would \ninvite a political backlash in advance of the 2008 presidential election.\n\nWarnings surfaced throughout the day that the bill was in trouble after the Senate, by a vote of 63-33, rejected an \ninitial motion to shut off debate. The second motion came hours later, at midevening, after a day of background \nnegotiations and calls to lawmakers from White House emissaries.\n\n\nIn the second test vote, 50 senators voted against a proposal to cut off debate, with 45 supporting it. The vote was \nwell below the 60-vote supermajority needed for approval. Thirty-eight Republicans, 11 Democrats, and one \nindependent voted against the motion, while seven Republicans, 37 Democrats and one independent voted for it. \n\nMissouri Sens. Christopher \"Kit\" Bond, a Republican, and Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, voted against cutting off \ndebate, while Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Barack Obama, both Democrats, voted to end it.\n\nDurbin said he and other Democratic leaders were disappointed at the inability of Bush and Republican senators to \nrally their party around a bill that came largely from Republicans.\n\n\"What we have seen is a parade of horribles, amendment after amendment offered by Republicans who will never \nvote for this immigration bill, trying to embarrass those who support it,\" Durbin said earlier Thursday.\n\nMcCaskill said a number of the bill's aspects bothered her. \"As a former auditor, I believe we should starve \nincompetent programs and not feed them,\" she said. \"We clearly know that the guest worker program is a path to \nillegal immigration. So, I think we starve an incompetent government agency. We don't feed it.\"\n\nReid had pressed for the motions to begin winding down debate and limiting an onslaught of amendments that he \nclaimed was aimed at killing the bill. The majority leader, while stressing the importance of immigration legislation, \nsaid the Senate had committed adequate time to the bill and needed to move on to other issues.\n\nRepublicans agreed among themselves to vote against ending debate to press their point that Democrats were \nbottling up needed amendments. In turn, Reid charged that the Republicans were engaging in stalling tactics and \nsaid he would withdraw the bill if the second vote to cut off debate failed.\n\n\"We need to have the record reflect that this bill isn't going anyplace, but it's not our fault,\" Reid told fellow senators \nat midday Thursday.\n\n---\n\nTalk\n\nSTLtoday.com/current What do you think of the how the Senate and the administration have handled the \nimmigration issue?
