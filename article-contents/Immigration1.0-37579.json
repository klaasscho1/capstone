For state summaries, see GAO- 10-1000SP. \nFor more information, contact J. Christopher Mihm at (202) 512-6806 or mihmj@gao.gov\n\nHighlights of GAO-10-999, a report to the Congress September2010 RECOVERY ACT Opportunities to Improve \nManagement and Strengthen Accountability over States' and Localities' Uses of Funds As of September 3, 2010, \nabout $154.8billion of the approximately $282 billion of total funds made available by the Recovery Act in 2009 for \nprograms administered by states and localities had been paid out by the federal government. Of that amount, over \n65 percent-$101.9 billion-had been paid out since the start of federal fiscal year 2010 on October 1, 2009\n\nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) As of July 31, 2010, the 16 states and the District had drawn down \n$43.9 billion in increased FMAP funds. If current spending patterns continue, GAO estimates that these states and \nthe District will draw down $56.2 billion by December 31, 2010-about 95 percent of their initial estimated allocation\n\nMost states reported that, without the increased FMAP funds, they could not have continued to support the \nsubstantial Medicaid enrollment growth they have experienced, most of which was attributable to children. Several \nstates also reported that the increased FMAP funds freed up states' funds which helped finance other needs. \nStates and the District remained concerned about the sustainability of their programs without these funds, and most \nhave already reduced or frozen certain provider payment rates or imposed new provider taxes. Congress recently \npassed legislation to extend the increased FMAP through June 2011, although at lower rates than provided by the \nRecovery Act. For future program adjustments, states and the District will also need to consider the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, which prohibits federal Medicaid reimbursement through 2014 if they apply \nmore restrictive eligibility standards, methods, or procedures\n\nEducation As of August 27, 2010, the District and states covered in GAO's review had drawn down 72 percent \n($18.2 billion) of their awarded State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) education stabilization funds; 46 percent \n($3.0 billion) for Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title I, Part A; and 45 percent ($3.4 billion) for \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B. In the spring of 2010, GAO surveyed a nationally representative \nsample of local educational agencies (LEA) and found that job retention was the primary use of education Recovery \nAct funds in school year 2009-2010, with an estimated 87 percent of LEAs reporting that Recovery Act funds \nallowed them to retain or create jobs. Even with Recovery Act funds, one-third of LEAs reported experiencing \nbudget cuts in school year 2009-2010 and nearly 1 in 4 reported losing jobs overall. Because of their budget \nsituations, relatively few LEAs reported making significant progress in advancing the four core education reform \nareas states are required to address as a condition of receiving SFSF funding. In August 2010, the Education Jobs \nFund was created to provide $10 billion to retain and create education jobs nationwide Highway Infrastructure \nInvestment and Public Transportation Funding Nationwide, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) obligated \n\n\n$25.6 billion in Recovery Act funds for over 12,300 highway projects, and This report responds to two ongoing \nGAO mandates under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). It is the latest in a \nseries of reports on the uses of and accountability for Recovery Act funds in 16 selected states, certain localities in \nthose jurisdictions, and the District of Columbia (District)\n\nThese jurisdictions are estimated to receive about two-thirds of the intergovernmental assistance available through \nthe Recovery Act\n\nThis report also responds to GAO's mandate to comment on the jobs estimated in recipient reports\n\nGAO collected and analyzed documents and interviewed state and local officials and other Recovery Act award \nrecipients\n\nGAO also analyzed federal agency guidance and interviewed federal officials\n\nWhat GAO Recommends GAO updates the status of agencies' efforts to implement GAO's 58 previous \nrecommendations and makes 5 new recommendations to improve management and strengthen accountability to \nthe Departments of Transportation (DOT), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Treasury, and the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB)\n\nAgency responses to GAO's new recommendations, as well as to key recommendations that remain open, are \nshown on the following page\n\nHighlights of GAO-10-999 (continued) reimbursed $11.1 billion as of August 2, 2010. The Federal Transit \nAdministration obligated $8.76 billion of Recovery Act funds for about 1,055 grants, and reimbursed $3.6 billion as \nof August 5, 2010. Highway funds were used primarily for pavement improvement projects, and public \ntransportation funds were used primarily for upgrading transit facilities and improving bus fleets. With emphasis \nplaced on the Recovery Act, many states were slower in obligating regular federal-aid highway funds; FHWA \nexpects all regular funds to be obligated by the end of the fiscal year. Publicly available data likely overstates the \nnumber and amount of contracts awarded. GAO recommends that DOT improve the accuracy of these data. DOT \nhas also not corrected previous public information overstating the amount of funds directed to economically \ndistressed areas. GAO recommends that DOT make revised information publicly available. DOT expects to be able \nto report on Recovery Act outputs, but did not commit to assessing whether transportation investments produced \nlong-term benefits as we recommended in May 2010. GAO believes that understanding the impact of Recovery Act \ninvestments continues to be important, plans to continue to monitor DOT's actions, and encourages it to report on \nlong-term benefits\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG), State Energy Program (SEP), and Weatherization \nAssistance The EECBG program provides about $3.2 billion in grants to implement projects that improve energy \nefficiency; of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion has been allocated directly to recipients. As of August 2010, \nDOE has obligated about 99 percent of the $2.8 billion in direct formula grants to recipients, who have in turn, \nobligated about half to subrecipients. The majority of EECBG funds have been obligated for three purposes, energy \nefficiency retrofits to existing facilities, financial incentive programs, and buildings and facilities. The Recovery Act \nalso provided $3.1 billion to the SEP, which provides funds through formula grants to achieve national energy goals \nsuch as increasing energy efficiency and decreasing energy costs. SEP recipients are obligating funds, monitoring, \nand reporting on project outcomes. The Recovery Act also appropriated $5 billion for the Weatherization \nAssistance Program\n\nDuring 2009, DOE obligated about $4.73 billion of the Recovery Act's weatherization funding, while retaining about \n5 percent of funds to cover the department's expenses. According to DOE officials, as of June 30, 2010, about \n166,000 homes have been weatherized nationwide, or about 29 percent of the 570,000 homes currently planned for \nweatherization. In May 2010, GAO made several recommendations to DOE, expressing concerns about whether \nprogram requirements were being met. DOE generally agreed and has begun to take steps in response to GAO's \nprevious recommendations\n\n\n\nPublic Housing Capital Fund, Tax Credit Assistance Program (TCAP), and the Section 1602 Program As of August \n7, 2010, housing agencies had obligated about 46 percent of the nearly $1 billion in Recovery Act Public Housing \nCapital Fund competitive grants allocated to them for projects such as installing energy- efficient heating and \ncooling systems in housing units\n\nHUD officials anticipate that some housing agencies may not meet the September 2010 obligation deadline, \nresulting in those funds being recaptured. GAO believes HUD should continue to closely monitor agencies' \nprogress in obligating remaining funds. As of July 31, 2010, HUD had outlayed about $733 million (32.6 percent) of \nTCAP funds and Treasury had outlayed about $1.4 billion (25.5 percent) of Section 1602 Program funds. Some \nstate Housing Finance Agencies (HFA) and projects may face challenges meeting upcoming deadlines, including \nthat projects spend 30 percent of Section 1602 Program project costs by December 2010\n\nGAO recommends that Treasury provide guidance to HFAs and plan to deal with the possibility that projects could \nmiss the spending deadline. Treasury said it will monitor project spending and provide additional guidance, if \nneeded. GAO also found that for some TCAP projects, enhanced HUD oversight may be needed. GAO \nrecommends that HUD develop a plan that recognizes the level of oversight others, including HFAs and investors, \nprovide. HUD agrees these projects need additional monitoring\n\nAccountability and Recipient Reporting OMB's Single Audit Internal Control Project highlighted areas where \nsignificant improvements in the Single Audit process are needed. Most federal awarding agencies did not exercise \ntimely follow-up on action plans to correct internal control deficiencies identified in the project's reports. Since \nawarding agencies are to approve corrective action plans, untimely follow-up could delay efforts to implement \ncorrective actions. In addition, the Single Audit process timeframes are not conducive to the timely identification and \ncorrection of internal control deficiencies. Further, OMB's Single Audit guidance has not been timely, causing \ninefficiencies related to Single Audits. GAO recommends that the Director of OMB take actions to strengthen the \nSingle Audit and federal follow-up as oversight mechanisms\n\nOMB concurred\n\nMany recipients reported greater ease in meeting their reporting requirements. GAO's analysis of the data in \nRecovery.gov shows some improvement, but data quality issues remain, such as the ability to link reports across \nquarters to follow project progress. OMB, HUD, and Education have implemented all of GAO's earlier \nrecommendations on recipient reporting, including those intended to improve subrecipient reporting. GAO will \ncontinue to monitor efforts to improve the quality of reporting\n\nRecovery Act Contents Letter 1 States' and Localities' Uses of Recovery Act Funds Continue 6 Many Recipients \nAre Citing

September 20, 2010 Report \nto the Congress In the over 18 months since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery \nAct)1 was enacted in February 2009, the Department of the Treasury has paid out approximately $154.8 billion in \nRecovery Act funds for use in states and localities.2 These funds have been used to support and preserve services \nin a wide range of areas including health, education, transportation, and housing The Recovery Act's recurring \nmandate specifies several roles for GAO, including conducting bimonthly reviews of how Recovery Act funds are \nbeing used in selected states and whether they are achieving the stated purposes of the act.3 Specifically, the \nstated purposes of the Recovery Act are to - preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery; - assist \nthose most impacted by the recession; - provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring \ntechnological advances in science and health; - invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other \ninfrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and - stabilize state and local government budgets in \norder to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases\n\nIn this report, the seventh in a series in response to the act's mandate, we update and add new information on the \nfollowing (1) selected states' and localities' uses of Recovery Act funds, (2) the approaches taken by the selected \nstates and localities to ensure accountability for Recovery Act funds, and (3) states' plans to evaluate the impact of \nthe Recovery Act funds they receive. As in our previous reports, we collected and reported data on programs \nreceiving substantial Recovery Act funds in 16 selected states, certain localities, and the District of Columbia, and \nmade 1Pub.

A, title IX, 901, 123 Stat. 191\n\nRecovery Act recommendations when changes could result in improvements.4 The selected jurisdictions for our in-\ndepth reviews contain about 65 percent of the U.S. population and are estimated to receive collectively about two- \nthirds of the intergovernmental assistance available through the Recovery Act.5 For this report, we visited a \nnonprobability sample of 167 entities within the 16 states and the District for our program reviews. These entities \nrepresented a range of types of governments and the program areas shown in table 1. The local governments also \nvaried by population sizes and economic conditions (unemployment rates greater than or less than the state's \noverall unemployment rate)\n\n4GAO, Recovery Act States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address Implementation \nChallenges and Bolster Accountability, GAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C.

A, 1512(e), 123 Stat. 288. We will refer to the quarterly reports required by \nsection 1512 as recipient reports\n\nNotes Entities include government officials and agencies, transportation and transit authorities, school districts, \ncharter schools, housing authorities, public utilities, and nonprofit organizations\n\nAppendix IV provides a complete list of the entities visited for this report\n\naThe District of Columbia is also included in GAO's bimonthly reviews of the use of Recovery Act funds\n\nAs in past reports, the programs we selected for review were chosen primarily because they have begun \ndisbursing funds to states or have known or potential risks. The risks can include existing programs receiving \nsignificant amounts of Recovery Act funds or new programs. In some cases, we have also collected data from all \nstates, and from an array of localities, to augment the in-depth reviews. This report focuses on the following \nprograms - Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP); - State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF); - Title I, Part \nA of the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 as amended (ESEA); - Parts B and C of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, as amended (IDEA); - Federal-Aid Highway Surface Transportation and Transit Capital \nAssistance Programs; - State Energy Program (SEP); - Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) \nProgram; - Weatherization Assistance Program; - Public Housing Capital Fund; - Tax Credit Assistance Program \n(TCAP); and - Grants to States for Low- Income Housing Projects in Lieu of Low- Income Housing Credits Program \nunder Section 1602 of division B of the Recovery Act (Section 1602 Program)\n\nThe Recovery Act also requires us to comment on the estimates of jobs created or retained reported by \nrecipients.6 In this report, we provide updated information concerning recipient reporting in accordance with our \nmandate for quarterly reporting. The Recovery Act requires that nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act funds, \nincluding grants, contracts, and loans submit quarterly reports which are to include a list of each project or activity \nfor which Recovery Act funds were expended or obligated and information concerning the amount and use of funds \nand jobs created or retained by these projects and activities, among other\n\nRecovery Act information. The latest of these recipient reports covered the activity as of the Recovery Act's \npassage through the quarter ending June 30, 2010\n\nIn this report, we also discuss state and local budget use of Recovery Act funds; federal requirements and \nguidance; and oversight, transparency, and accountability issues related to the Recovery Act and its \n\n\n\nimplementation. The report provides overall findings, discusses agency actions in response to the open \nrecommendations we made in our prior reports, and presents new recommendations. Our oversight of programs \nfunded by the Recovery Act has resulted in more than 62 Recovery Act related products. See the GAO Related \nProducts section of this report for a list of these products\n\nGoing forward to meet our reoccurring Recovery Act mandates, we will continue to capitalize on the work we have \ndone over the past 18 months in the selected states and the District. However, our focus will shift from reporting on \nthe uses of funds by the selected states and the District for a group of programs funded by the Recovery Act to \nproviding enhanced analysis of the use of Recovery Act funds by states and localities for a single program funded \nby the Recovery Act in each bimonthly review. We will also shift our review of recipient reporting to focus \nspecifically on implementation within that Recovery Act program. Given that, as of September 3, 2010, more than \nhalf-about $154.8 billion of the approximately $282 billion-of total Recovery Act funds for programs administered by \nstates and localities had been paid out by the federal government, evolving to this approach is appropriate and will \nallow us to provide Congress and other decision makers with more in-depth analyses of programs funded by the \nRecovery Act and to be responsive to congressional interest in the impact and outcomes of programs as Recovery \nAct implementation moves forward\n\nIn conducting our work for this report, we analyzed guidance and interviewed officials at the Office of Management \nand Budget. We also analyzed grant awards-as well as relevant regulations and federal agency guidance on \nprograms selected for this review-and spoke with relevant program officials at the U.S. Departments of Health and \nHuman Services (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), Education, Transportation, Energy, and Housing \nand Urban Development. In addition, we spoke to entities that play roles in oversight of Recovery Act spending, \nincluding federal agency inspectors general, state and local auditors, as well as the\n\nRecovery Act 7The Recovery Act established the Board to coordinate and conduct oversight of covered funds to \nprevent fraud, waste, and abuse. The Board is composed of a chairperson and 12 inspectors general. In addition, \nthe Board established three committees drawn from the 12 inspectors general on the board. Recovery Act, div.

We conducted interviews with state budget officials and reviewed proposed and enacted \nbudgets and revenue forecasts to update our understanding of the use of Recovery Act funds in the 16 selected \nstates and the District. To update our understanding of local governments' use of Recovery Act funds, we met with \nfinance officials and city administrators at the selected localities\n\nWhere statements about state law are attributed to state officials, we did not analyze state legal materials for this \nreport but relied on state officials and other state sources for description and interpretation of relevant state \nconstitutions, statutes, legislative proposals, and other state legal materials. The information obtained from this \nreview cannot be generalized to all states and localities receiving Recovery Act funding. A detailed description of \nour scope and methodology can be found in appendix I\n\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 27, 2010, to September 20, 2010, in accordance with generally \naccepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nsufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit \nobjectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions \nbased on our audit objectives\n\n\n\nAs shown in figure 1, actual federal outlays to states and localities under the Recovery Act totaled approximately \n$154.8 billion through September 3, 2010.

The federal government matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a \nformula based on each state's per capita income in relation to the national average per capita income. The rate at \nwhich states are reimbursed for Medicaid service expenditures is known as the Federal Medical Assistance \nPercentage (FMAP), which may range from 50 percent to no more than 83 This figure is presented to show actual \nand estimated federal outlays (in billions of dollars) to states and localities under the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009. Actual federal outlays totaled approximately $146 billion through August 6, 2010. More \nthan 60 percent-$93 billion- has been paid out since the start of federal fiscal year 2010 on October 1, 2009. (The \nfederal fiscal year runs from October 1 through September 30 of the next calendar year.)

No. 111-5, 123 Stat. at 496. CMS made increased FMAP \nfunds available to states on February 25, 2009, and states could retroactively claim reimbursement for expenditures \nthat occurred as of October 1, 2008\n\n10See Pub. L. No. 111-226, 201, 124 Stat. 2389 (Aug. 10, 2010)\n\n11For purposes of this report, the term \"regular FMAP\" refers to the FMAP as defined in section 1905(b) of the \nSocial Security Act. The term \"increased FMAP\" refers to the temporary FMAP calculated based on provisions of \n5001 of the Recovery Act, as amended\n\n12Under the amendment to the Recovery Act, states will receive a general across-the-board increase of 3.2 \npercentage points in their regular FMAPs for the second quarter of federal fiscal year 2011 and a 1.2 percentage \npoint increase in their regular FMAP rates for the third quarter of federal fiscal year 2011. See Pub. L. No. 111-226, \n201, 124 Stat. 2389 (2010). States will continue to be eligible for an unemployment adjustment to their FMAP rates\n\npercent. To obtain federal matching funds for Medicaid, states file a quarterly financial report with the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and draw down funds through an existing payment management system \nused by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\n\nThe Recovery Act initially provided eligible states with an estimated $87 billion through increased FMAP rates for 27 \nmonths from October 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010.9 On August 10, 2010, federal legislation was enacted \namending the Recovery Act and providing for an extension of increased FMAP funding through June 30, 2011, but \nat a lower level.10 On February 25, 2009, CMS made increased FMAP grant awards to states, and states may \nretroactively claim reimbursement for expenditures that occurred prior to the effective date of the Recovery Act. \nGenerally, for fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, the increased FMAP is calculated on a \nquarterly basis and is comprised of three components (1) a \"hold harmless\" provision, which maintains states' \nregular FMAP rates at the highest rate of any fiscal year from 2008 through 2011;11 (2) a general across-the-board \nincrease of 6.2 percentage points in states' regular FMAPs through the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, which will \nthen be phased down until July 1, 2011;12 and (3) a further increase in the FMAPs for those states that have a \nqualifying increase in unemployment rates\n\nFor states to qualify for the increased FMAP, they must pay the state's share of Medicaid costs and comply with a \nnumber of requirements, including the following\n\n\n\nRecovery Act 13See Recovery Act, div. B, title V, 5001(f)(1)(A)\n\n14Under the Recovery Act, states are not eligible to receive the increased FMAP for certain claims for days during \nany period in which that state has failed to meet the prompt payment requirement under the Medicaid statute as \napplied to those claims. See Recovery Act, div. B, title V, 5001(f)(2). Prompt payment requires states to pay 90 \npercent of clean claims from health care practitioners and certain other providers within 30 days of receipt and 99 \npercent of these claims within 90 days of receipt. See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(37)(A). A clean claim is a claim that has \nno defect or impropriety (including any lack of any required substantiating documentation) or particular \ncircumstance requiring special treatment that prevents timely payment from being made on the claim. See Social \nSecurity Act section 1816\n\n15States may obtain a waiver from the act's prompt payment requirements if the Secretary of HHS determines that \nthere are exigent circumstances, including natural disasters, which would prevent a state from the timely processing \nof claims or compliance with reporting requirements A CMS official told us that Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nNorth Dakota, and Pennsylvania had received approval for a waiver from the act's prompt payment requirement, \nand that three states-Idaho, Michigan, and Wisconsin-have requested waivers that are under review\n\n16A state is not eligible for certain elements of increased FMAP if any amounts attributable directly or indirectly to \nthem are deposited in or credited to a state reserve or rainy-day fund. Recovery Act, div. B, title V, 5001(f)(3)\n\n17In some states, political subdivisions-such as cities and counties-may be required to help finance the state's \nshare of Medicaid spending. Under the Recovery Act, a state that has such financing arrangements is not eligible \nfor certain elements of the increased FMAP if it requires subdivisions to pay during a quarter of the recession \nadjustment period a greater percentage of the nonfederal share than the percentage that would have otherwise \nbeen required under the state plan on September 30, 2008. See Recovery Act, div. B, title V, 5001(g)(2). The \nrecession adjustment period is the period beginning October 1, 2008, and ending June 30, 2011\n\n- States generally may not apply eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures that are more restrictive than \nthose that were in effect under their state Medicaid programs on July 1, 2008;13 - states must comply with prompt \npayment requirements;14,15 - states cannot deposit or credit amounts attributable (either directly or indirectly) to \ncertain elements of the increased FMAP in any reserve or rainy-day fund of the state;16 and - states with political \nsubdivisions-such as cities and counties-that contribute to the nonfederal share of Medicaid spending cannot \nrequire the subdivisions to pay a greater percentage of the nonfederal share than would have been required on \nSeptember 30, 2008.17 In addition, CMS requires states to separately track and report on increased FMAP funds. \nTo help states comply with these requirements, CMS provided the funds to states through a separate account in an\n\nRecovery Act 18For example, CMS's Web site includes State Medicaid Director letters related to the availability or \nuse of increased FMAP funds. See http//www.cms.hhs.gov/SMDL/SMD/list.asp?sortByDID=1a&submit=Go&filter \nType=none &filterByDID=-99&sortOrder=ascending&intNumPerPage=10\n\n19Immediately following the enactment of the Recovery Act, FMAP rates for the 16 states and the District \nincreased, on average, 9.23 percentage points over their regular 2009 rates\n\nIncreased FMAP rates continued to increase through fourth quarter fiscal year 2010- except for California and \nFlorida, whose FMAPs did not increase above their initial first quarter 2009 rates\n\n20Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the District and all states but Iowa had received the maximum \nunemployment increase possible. Under the Recovery Act, once a state qualifies for an unemployment increase, \nthe increase is maintained through December 31, 2010. Beginning January 1, 2011, states that experience a \nsufficient decrease in their unemployment rates could have their increased FMAP rates reduced and HHS is \nrequired to provide such states with a 60-day notice of a pending reduction\n\nexisting payment management system. CMS also provided guidance in the form of State Medicaid Director letters \nand written responses to frequently asked questions, and the agency continues to work with states on an individual \n\nhttp://www.cms.hhs.gov/SMDL/SMD/list.asp?sortByDID=1a&submit=Go&filter\n\n\nbasis to resolve any compliance issues that may arise.18 Despite these restrictions, states are able to make certain \nadjustments to their Medicaid programs without risking their eligibility for increased FMAP funds. For example, the \nRecovery Act does not prohibit states from reducing or eliminating optional services, such as dental services, or \nreducing provider payment rates. States also continue to have flexibility in how they finance the nonfederal share of \nMedicaid payments, and may implement new financing arrangements or alter existing ones-such as provider taxes, \nintergovernmental transfers, and certified public expenditures-to generate additional revenues to help finance the \nnonfederal share of their Medicaid programs\n\nIncreased FMAP Key to States' Continued Efforts to Support Medicaid Enrollment Growth The FMAP rates in the \n16 states and the District increased substantially immediately following enactment of the Recovery Act, and most \nstates' rates continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace, through the fourth quarter of federal fiscal year 2010.19 \nDuring the fourth quarter of federal fiscal year 2010, the increased FMAP averaged about 11 percentage points \nhigher than the regular 2010 FMAP rates, with increases ranging from about 9 percentage points in Iowa to nearly \n13 percentage points in Florida. For all states and the District, the largest proportion of the increased FMAP was the \ncomponent attributable to the across-the-board increase of 6.2 percentage points, followed by qualifying increases \nin unemployment rates in each of the states.20 The \"hold harmless\"\n\nRecovery Act component further contributed to the increased FMAP in five sample states, although to a lesser \nextent.

Feb. 4, 2009). The Recovery Act \nprovided states and the District with an estimated $87 billion in increased FMAP funds for Medicaid from February \n2009 through December 2010. Our estimate was based on funds drawn down by states as of June 30, 2010\n\nAs of July 31, 2010, the 16 states and the District had drawn down $43.9 billion in increased FMAP funds, which is \n75 percent of the total $58.9 billion in increased FMAP that we estimated would be allocated to these states and the \nDistrict through December 31, 2010.21 (See table 3.) If current spending patterns continue, we estimate that the 16 \nstates and the District will draw down $56.2 billion by December 31, 2010-about 95 percent of the initial estimated \nallocation. The national drawdown mirrors the experiences of our sample states, with the 50 states and the District \nhaving drawn down 74 percent of their estimated total allocation of nearly $87 billion through the end of 2010\n\n\n\nTable 3 Estimated Allocations and Funds Drawn Down for Recovery Act Increased FMAP for 16 States and the \nDistrict as of July 31, 2010 Dollars in thousands State Increased FMAPestimated allocations to statesthrough \nDecember 31, 2010 Total funds drawndown through July 31, 2010 Percentage ofestimated allocations drawn down \nthrough July 31, 2010 Arizona $2,031,000 $1,506,593 74.18 California 10,579,000 7,780,020 73.54 Colorado \n858,000 665,349 77.55 District Of Columbia 316,000 258,885 81.93 Florida 4,256,000 3,503,359 82.32 Georgia \n1,766,000 1,253,713 70.99 Illinois 2,774,000 2,386,470 86.03 Iowa 607,000 415,160 68.40 Massachusetts \n3,016,000 2,337,215 77.49 Michigan 2,294,000 1,905,868 83.08 Mississippi 861,000 589,029 68.41 New Jersey \n2,134,000 1,653,401 77.48 New York 12,332,000 8,204,506 66.53 North Carolina 2,406,000 1,776,605 73.84 Ohio \n3,097,000 2,278,688 73.58 Pennsylvania 4,054,000 2,955,713 72.91\n\nRecovery Act 22Since October 2007, enrollment growth varied considerably across the 16 states and the District, \nranging from 6 percent in Texas to 35 percent in Colorado. Much of Texas's reported enrollment growth occurred \nbetween March and June 2010. Prior to March, the state reported flat enrollment from October 2007 through \nFebruary 2010. Note that the percentages are based on state-reported monthly enrollment data, some of which are \npreliminary and subject to change\n\n23For example, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that national Medicaid enrollment increased by about 1 \npercent from December 2004 through June 2007. See The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, \nThe Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid Enrollment in the 50 States June 2008 Data Update (Washington, \nD.C., September 2009)\n\nTexas 5,533,000 4,427,624 80.02 Sample total $58,914,000 $43,898,198 74.51 National totala $86,593,000 \n$64,071,729 73.99 Source GAO analysis of HHS data aThe national total includes the 50 states and the District of \nColumbia\n\nWhile the increased FMAP funds are for Medicaid services only, the receipt of these funds may free up funds that \nstates would otherwise have had to use for their Medicaid programs. Similar to their reported uses in fiscal year \n2009 and the first half of fiscal year 2010, the 16 states and the District most commonly reported using or planning \nto use these freed-up funds to cover increased Medicaid caseloads, maintain program eligibility levels, and to \nfinance general budget needs. As with our last survey, most states reported that increased FMAP funding \ncontinues to be a major factor in their ability to cover enrollment growth, which has continued to increase since our \nlast Recovery Act report. Between February 2010 and June 2010, overall enrollment across the 16 states and the \nDistrict grew by an average of nearly 2 percent,22 with a cumulative increase of 18 percent since October 2007-a \nrate of increase that is significantly higher than in years prior to the recession.23 The increase in Medicaid \nenrollment continues to be attributable primarily to children, a population that is sensitive to economic downturns. \nHowever, the highest rate of increase during this period occurred among the nondisabled, nonaged adult \npopulation-35 percent, compared to an increase of nearly 19 percent for children\n\nRecovery Act 24One state reported it did not know if there had been a change in its application processing time \nsince October 2007. We defined application processing time as the number of days between the date a new \napplication is received and a final eligibility determination is made\n\nStates reporting a decrease in processing time most frequently attributed the decrease to streamlined processing \nprocedures, such as use of electronic applications or the automation of citizenship documentation\n\n25CMS generally requires states to process new applications within 45 days from the date of application, or 90 \ndays for individuals applying on the basis of disability\n\nIn addition, 10 states and the District reported using freed up funds to maintain benefits and services or to maintain \npayment rates for practitioners or institutional providers. Six states reported using these funds to meet prompt \npayment requirements, and five states and the District reporting using the funds to help finance their State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program or other local public health insurance programs. While most states continue to \nreport using freed- up funds for multiple purposes, North Carolina and Ohio again reported that they use these \nfunds exclusively to finance general budget needs\n\n\n\nDespite increases in program enrollment since October 2007, state responses were mixed when asked about \nchanges in the time it takes to process new Medicaid applications. While six states reported an increase in the time \nit takes to process new applications-most commonly attributing this change to an increase in the volume of new \napplications and staff cutbacks-nine states and the District reported no change or a decrease in the processing \ntime.24 Most states and the District reported processing applications, on average, within federally-required time \nframes.25 States Have Taken Actions to Sustain Their Medicaid Programs; Further Adjustments Will Depend on \nFederal Legislation When asked about the long-term outlook for their Medicaid programs, the District and all but \nthree of the 16 states reported a concern about sustaining their Medicaid programs once increased FMAP funding \nis no longer available. When asked about the factors driving their concerns, most states and the District reported \n(1) the increased share of the state's Medicaid payments in 2011; (2) the current projection of the state's economy \nand tax revenues; and (3) the current projected growth in the state's Medicaid enrollment for 2011. Mississippi, \nOhio, and Texas did not report concerns about their Medicaid programs' sustainability once\n\nRecovery Act 26Mississippi previously reported concerns about the sustainability of its program once increased \nFMAP funds were no longer available; however, a Medicaid official said that more recently, the state decided to use \nstate sources to fully fund the program through 2011. The official added that how the state will fund the Medicaid \nprogram in 2012 is not yet known\n\n27The Kaiser Family Foundation recently reported that several Medicaid Directors have expressed concern over \nthe impact that multiple payment cuts to providers may have had on access to services. See The Henry J. Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, State Medicaid Agencies Prepare for Health Care Reform While Continuing to Face Challenges \nfrom the Recession (Washington, D.C., August 2010)\n\nincreased FMAP funds are no longer available.26 Due to these concerns, most states reported taking actions to \nadjust their Medicaid programs, including reducing or freezing provider payment rates, implementing new or \nincreasing existing provider taxes, or reducing certain optional benefits\n\nSpecifically, 12 states reported reducing or freezing provider payment rates. When given a list of 13 types of \nproviders, these states reported implementing 55 payment rate reductions and 46 payment rate freezes, for a total \n101 different rate actions taken since February 2009; on average, these states reduced or froze payment rates for 8 \ntypes of providers.27 States frequently reduced or froze payment rates to nursing facilities, clinics, and home health \nproviders, among others. (See table 4.)

Specifically, 21 of the 28 taxes were imposed on inpatient hospitals, nursing facilities, and outpatient \nhospitals- providers for which most states reported paying on a cost basis.29 (See figure 2.) Figure 2 Number of \nStates Implementing New or Increased Provider Taxes, February 2009 through July 2010 This graph shows the \n\n\n\nnumber of states (out of the 16 sample states and DC for the GAO Recovery Act work) that have implemented new \nprovider taxes or increased existing ones for either inpatient hospitals, nursing facilities, or outpatient hospitals\n\nRecovery Act In some cases, states reported implementing payment rate reductions and new taxes on the same \nproviders. For example, at least half of the states that implemented new or increased taxes for inpatient hospitals, \nnursing facilities, or outpatient hospitals also reduced or froze payments to those same providers. In addition to \nchanges to payment rates and provider taxes, eight states reported making reductions to optional benefits and \nservices, most commonly reducing or eliminating dental services for adults. Several states provided estimates of \nsavings or increased revenue generated by actions they undertook. For example, - California estimated savings of \nnearly $600 million from payment rate freezes for long-term care providers and other rate reductions, and the \ndiscontinuation of dental and certain other optional services; - Michigan estimated savings of $152 million from an 8 \npercent reduction in payment rates for all providers; - Pennsylvania projected that a new hospital provider tax will \ngenerate $498 million in new revenue for the state; and - New York estimated that increases in various provider \ntaxes will generate an additional $184 million annually\n\nStates were less certain when asked about future program changes that may be necessary to sustain their \nMedicaid programs after Recovery Act funding ends, and their uncertainty was likely due to questions surrounding a \npotential extension of the increased FMAP, as well as Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) \nprovisions. At the time of our survey, the legislation amending the Recovery Act to extend the increased FMAP had \nbeen proposed but not yet enacted, and the PPACA had just recently been enacted. Despite states' uncertainties, \nhowever, 12 states and the District reported on the survey that their 2011 budgets had assumed a full extension of \nthe increased FMAP, and many of these states had not developed a contingency plan in the event that such \nlegislation was not enacted. Nationally, 30 states assumed an extension of increased FMAP in their 2011 budgets\n\nUnder the recent amendments to the Recovery Act, states' increased FMAP rates will decrease by at least 3 \npercentage points beginning on January 1, 2011, and continue to be phased down to their regular FMAP rates by \nJuly 1, 2011. For states that had assumed a full extension of the increased FMAP, the available federal funds will \nbe less than anticipated\n\nThe effect of these decreases in states' FMAP rates will vary depending on each state's unique economic \ncircumstances and the size of their Medicaid population\n\nRecovery Act 30Pub. L. No. 111-148, 2001(b)(2), 124 Stat. 118, 275. This requirement will continue to apply to \nchildren until October 1, 2019. Beginning on January 1, 2011, this provision may have limited applicability if a state \ncertifies to the Secretary that it has a budget deficit or projects to have a budget deficit in the following fiscal year. \nPub. L. No. 111-148, 2001(b)(2). According to CMS, the agency is currently developing guidance on various \nPPACA provisions\n\n31Connecticut has also obtained approval from CMS to expand eligibility to shift eligible low-income adults from an \nexisting state health care program into Medicaid. Six sample states and the District reported that they currently \nprovide coverage to some adults above 133 percent of the federal poverty level through their Medicaid, State \nChildren's Health Insurance Plan, or other state program\n\nPPACA also includes several provisions that could affect states' Medicaid programs, and 12 states and the District \nreported that PPACA will be a major factor in their ability to make future changes to their programs. For example, \nthe maintenance-of-eligibility requirement under PPACA precludes states from receiving federal Medicaid funding if \nthey apply eligibility standards, methods, or procedures under their plan or waiver that are more restrictive than \nthose in effect on the date of PPACA's enactment until the date the Secretary of HHS determines that a health \ninsurance exchange established by the state is fully operational, which must be no later than January 1, 2014.30 \nPPACA also requires states to expand Medicaid eligibility by 2014 to cover all persons under age 65 who are not \nalready eligible under mandatory eligibility groups and with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, \nbut states have the option to expand eligibility immediately and to receive federal funds for these individuals. While \nthe District has already been approved by CMS to expand eligibility to cover this group prior to 2014, and two other \n\n\n\nstates- California and Colorado-reported that they are planning to do so, it remains to be seen how all the states \nwill respond to this option.31 Local Educational Agencies Reported Using Recovery Act Funds for Job Retention \nand One- Time, Nonrecurring Purchases, While Education Continues Monitoring Efforts\n\nRecovery Act 32We conducted our survey between March and April 2010, with a 78 percent final weighted \nresponse rate at the national level. The results of our sample have a 95 percent confidence interval, with a margin \nof error of plus or minus 7 percentage points or less, unless otherwise noted. Our survey was conducted prior to the \nenactment of Pub.L. No. 111-226, which provides $10 billion for the new Education Jobs Fund. As a result, some of \nthe information contained in this report, specifically information related to LEAs' projections for the 2010-2011 \nschool year, does not reflect this additional federal funding\n\n33The five states were Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York\n\n34The five states were Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York\n\n35The four states were California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New York\n\nAs Many LEAs Reported Facing Budget Cuts and Fiscal Pressures, Job Retention Was the Primary Use of \nRecovery Act Education Funds Our review of states' use of Recovery Act funds covers three programs \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Education (Education)-the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF); Title I, \nPart A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended; and the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part B, as amended. As part of this review, we surveyed a nationally \nrepresentative sample of local educational agencies (LEA)-generally, school districts-about their uses of Recovery \nAct funds for each of these programs.32 We also met with program officials at the U.S. Department of Education to \ndiscuss ongoing monitoring and technical assistance efforts for Recovery Act funds provided through ESEA Title I, \nIDEA, and SFSF. At the state level, we spoke with state ESEA Title I officials in five states33 and the District of \nColumbia, which had relatively low drawdown rates of ESEA Title I Recovery Act funds. We also interviewed state \nofficials in five states34 and the District of Columbia about their application for and implementation of the School \nImprovement Grant program. Finally, we interviewed officials in eight LEAs located in four states35 to understand \nhow they were using their Recovery Act funds\n\nEven with Recovery Act Funds, an Estimated One-Third of LEAs Experienced Funding Cuts in School Year 2009-\n2010 and More Anticipated Cuts in 2010-2011 Education funding in the United States primarily comes from state \nand local governments. Prior to the influx of Recovery Act funding for education from the federal government, LEAs, \non average, derived about 48 percent of their fiscal year 2008 funding from state funds, 44 percent\n\nRecovery Act 36Zhou, L.

The fiscal survey of states does not present these data on the District of \nColumbia\n\n38The number of states reporting K-12 state-level funding cuts to education funding in fiscal year 2010 is based on \nself-reported data collected by the National Association of State Budget Officers in the spring of 2010. The Fiscal \nSurvey of States, \"Table 1-A. Fiscal 2010 Program Area Cuts\" (page 4), published by the National Governors \nAssociation and the National Association of State Budget Officers (June 2010)\n\n39These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, \nand North Carolina\n\n\n\nfrom local funds, and 8 percent from federal funds.36 These percentages, however, likely shifted due to increased \nfederal funding through the Recovery Act and reductions in some state budgets for education. While the federal role \nin financing public education has historically been a limited one, the federal funds appropriated under the Recovery \nAct provide a significant, but temporary, increase in federal support for education to states and localities, in part, to \nhelp them address budget shortfalls. According to the Congressional Research Service, the Recovery Act provided \napproximately $100 billion for discretionary education programs in fiscal year 2009, which, when combined with \nregular appropriations for discretionary education programs, represents about a 235 percent increase in federal \nfunding compared to fiscal year 2008\n\nOver the last 2 years-a time period when many states have dealt with decreasing revenues as a result of the \nsustained economic downturn-a number of states in our review experienced K-12 education cuts. (See table 5 \nbelow for expenditure changes for states in fiscal years 2008 and 2009.) Nationwide, 34 states reported that they \ncut K- 12 education funding in fiscal year 2010, including 12 of the 16 states in our review,37 according to the Fiscal \nSurvey of States.38 In some states, such as Arizona and Georgia, these fiscal year 2010 cuts were in addition to \nexpenditure cuts in fiscal years 2009 or 2008. However, other states such as Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, \nand Michigan experienced cuts to education expenditures in fiscal year 2009 but did not report cutting K-12 funding \nin 2010. Looking forward to fiscal year 2011, cuts for K-12 education had been proposed in 10 of the 16 states in \nour review,39 according to data presented in the June\n\nRecovery Act 40The Fiscal Survey of States, June 2010, \"Table 1-B.Proposed Fiscal 2011 Program Area Cuts\" \n(page 6)\n\n2010 Fiscal Survey of States report.40 Given that nearly half of LEA funding, on average, is provided by the states, \nthe impact of state-levelcuts to education could significantly affect LEA bu Table 5 Recent Fiscal Year State-Level \nK-12 Education Expenditure Changes for the States in Our Review Dollars in millions State Changes from fiscal \nyear 2007 Compared to fiscal year 2008 Changes from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 Expenditure changes \nPercentage change Expenditure changes Percentage change Arizona (175) (2.9) (367) (6.4) California 2,608 7.1 \n(7,549) (19.1) Colorado 837 13.0 (406) (5.6) Florida 25 0.2 (1,280) (12.1) Georgia 573 7.8 (459) (5.8) Illinois 818 \n11.1 724 8.8 Iowa 195 8.3 135 5.3 Massachusetts 366 7.4 (238) (4.5) Michigan (176) (1.5) (315) (2.8) Mississippi \n182 7.8 79 3.1 New Jersey 627 6.0 615 5.6 New York 1,839 9.7 1,668 8.0 North Carolina 581 7.7 141 1.7 Ohio 116 \n1.3 1,643 17.9 Pennsylvania 556 6.3 930 9.9 Texas 3,886 24.7 1,709 8.7 Source National Association of State \nBudget Officers, State Expenditure Report, fiscal year 2008 tables 7 and 9\n\nNotes State expenditure changes to K-12 education include state general fund and other state funds but do not \ninclude Recovery Act or other federal funding or funding from bonds.

Data were reported by states and were not compared to actual budget figures\n\nThe funding condition of LEAs across the country is mixed, and districts expected it to worsen in the 2010-2011 \nschool year, even with Recovery Act funding-however, the new Education Jobs Fund created in August 2010 will \nprovide some additional funding. As shown in figure 3, an\n\nRecovery Act 41Our survey was conducted from March to April 2010, prior to the new $10 billion Education Jobs \nFund established in August 2010\n\n42Pub. L. No. 111-226, 101\n\nestimated one-third of LEAs faced funding decreases in the 2009- 2010 school year, but according to our survey \nconducted in March and April 2010, more than one-half of LEAs-56 percent-are expecting to face funding \ndecreases in the upcoming 2010-2011 school year.41 LEA officials we spoke with in California and Massachusetts \nexpect funding declines in 2010-2011 which come on top of cuts made in prior years, indicating that state-level cuts \nto education have been the primary reason for their large funding declines and continue to provide an uncertain \nlandscape for school funding in coming years. Public Law 111-226, enacted on August 10, 2010 provides $10 \n\n\n\nbillion for the new Education Jobs Fund to retain and create education jobs nationwide.42 The Fund will generally \nsupport education jobs in the 2010-2011 school year and be distributed to states by a formula based on population \nfigures. States can distribute their funding to LEAs based on their own primary funding formulas or LEAs' relative \nshare of federal ESEA Title I funds\n\nHowever, while many LEAs reported worsening funding situations, the overall funding levels of many other LEAs \nincreased or remained the same in the 2009-2010 school year; although before the new Education Jobs Fund was \ncreated, a smaller proportion reported expecting funding increases in 2010-2011. Specifically, around half of LEAs \nreported that their overall funding level in the 2009-2010 school year had increased compared to the previous year, \nand an estimated 12 percent reported that their funding had remained the same. We contacted several school \nofficials who had reported on the survey that their district's funding had increased for the 2009-2010 school year, \nfor the 2010-2011 school year, or during both years. These officials offered a variety of explanations for such \nfunding increases, including increased enrollment numbers due to having added a grade level, having won \ncompetitive grant awards, a rebound in state tuition revenue, and having received state aid for a previously \napproved capital project, including additions to a middle school and high school\n\nRecovery Act Figure 3 Estimated Percentage of LEAs with Funding-Level Changes in School Year 2009-2010 and \nAnticipated Changes for School Year 2010- 2011, as reported in Spring 2010 Note Percentage estimates have \nmargins of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 6 percentage points or less\n\nMoreover, before the creation of the Education Jobs Fund, of those LEAs experiencing funding decreases, the \npercentage of LEAs that anticipated funding cuts greater than 5 percent is notably higher for the 2010-2011 school \nyear than for the 2009-2010 school year. Specifically, as shown in figure 4, an estimated 31 percent of LEAs \nexpected funding reductions greater than 5 percent in the 2010-2011 school year, compared to 18 percent of LEAs \nthat experienced cuts of this magnitude during the 2009- 2010 school year. The percentage of LEAs who \nanticipated funding cuts of 10 percent or higher is also projected to increase somewhat, from 8 percent in the 2009-\n2010 school year to 14 percent in the 2010-2011 school year. Officials in some of the school districts we visited in \nJune and July 2010-before the creation of the Education Jobs Fund- noted that their funding situation would likely \nbe more dire in the 2011-2012 school year, when Recovery Act funds are no longer available. For example, Boston \nPublic Schools in Massachusetts, which reported experiencing funding decreases this year and the past 2 years, is \nalready preparing for a decreased budget in fiscal year 2012 and beginning to plan how to address This figure is \npresented to show the estimated percentage of local education agencies (LEA) that reported funding level changes \nin school year 2009-2010 and the percentage of LEAs that anticipated funding level changes in school year 2010-\n2011. This information was collected through a nationally representative survey of LEAs in Spring 2010\n\nRecovery Act budget shortfalls. Additionally, fewer LEAs anticipate funding increases of more than 5 percent for the \n2010-2011 school year than for the 2009-2010 school year. Specifically, as shown in figure 4, only 5 percent of \nLEAs reported anticipating overall funding levels to increase by more than 5 percent for the 2010-2011 school year \ncompared to 17 percent in the 2009- 2010 school year\n\nFigure 4 Estimated Percentage of LEAs with Sizeable Funding Changes for School Year 2009-2010 and Expected \nFunding Changes for School Year 2010-2011, as reported in Spring 2010 Note Percentage estimates have \nmargins of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 5 percentage points or less\n\nWe also found statistically significant differences between the fiscal situations of urban and rural LEAs and between \nLEAs of different sizes\n\nFor example, significantly more urban LEAs than rural LEAs experienced total funding increases of over 5 percent \nin the 2009-2010 school year\n\nSpecifically, an estimated 32 percent of urban LEAs experienced total funding increases of over 5 percent in the \n2009-2010 school year compared to an estimated 8 percent of rural LEAs. We did not find a significant difference \nbetween urban and rural LEAs for the 2010-2011 school year, however. While urban LEAs generally fared better \nthan rural LEAs, we found that a larger percentage of the largest LEAs reported expecting a budget decrease for \n\n\n\nthe 2010-2011 school year when compared to all other This figure depicts the estimated percentage of LEAs that \nreported sizeable funding changes for school year 2009-2010 and the percentage of LEAs that expected funding \nchanges for 2010-2011, as reported in our survey of Spring 2010. This figure shows that a larger percentage of \nLEAs expected large funding decreases in the 2010-2011 school year than in the 2009-2010 school year at the time \nof our survey\n\nRecovery Act 43For our survey, we included a separate strata of the 100 largest LEAs as defined by the number of \nstudents. We received a final weighted response rate of 84 percent for this strata\n\nLEAs.43 Specifically, we found that 36 percent of the largest LEAs expected funding to decrease by between 1 and \n5 percent in the 2010-2011 school year compared to 26 percent of all other LEAs\n\nTo Address Expected Funding Decreases, in Spring 2010 Many LEAs Reported Being Very Likely to Cut \nTeachers, Related Staff, and Other Items Of the 56 percent of LEAs expecting funding decreases, many reported \nbeing likely (somewhat or very) to take personnel actions such as cutting positions or freezing pay. However, this \ninformation was reported before the $10 billion Education Jobs Fund was created. Our survey results also show \nthat some LEAs also reported being likely to furlough teachers\n\nSpecifically, an estimated 76 percent of LEAs that expected funding decreases reported they were likely to cut \nnoninstructional positions and an estimated 70 percent reported they were likely to cut instructional positions. (See \nfig. 5.) For example, when we met with officials in California's Mountain View-Whisman School District in June \n2010, before the Education Jobs Fund had been created, they expected to cut 20 percent of their K-3 teaching staff \nin the upcoming school year in part due to projected revenue decreases of between 6 to 10 percent. Given these \nplanned reductions in instructional staff, an estimated 70 percent of LEAs reported being likely to increase class \nsize in the coming school year. For example, LEA officials in Mountain View-Whisman School District, Elk Grove \nUnified School District in California, and Revere Public Schools in Massachusetts said they were increasing class \nsizes to deal with budget shortfalls. In addition to cutting positions, an estimated 61 percent of LEAs expecting \nfunding decreases are likely to reduce professional development or teacher training. Approximately 55 percent of \nLEAs expecting funding decreases reported being likely to freeze pay, and around one-third reported being likely \nto furlough teachers. For example, officials at San Bernardino City Unified School District and Elk Grove Unified \nSchool District in California told us they had decided to furlough some employee groups for at least 9 days in the \n2010-2011 school year\n\nRecovery Act Figure 5 Likely Personnel Actions for the 2010-2011 School Year Reported by LEAs Anticipating \nFunding Decreases, as Reported in Spring 2010 Note Percentage estimates have margins of error, at the 95 \npercent confidence level, of plus or minus 8 percentage points or less\n\nSimilarly, many LEAs expecting funding decreases also reported being likely (somewhat or very) to take \nnonpersonnel actions, such as reducing instructional supplies and eliminating summer programs. Specifically, an \nestimated 87 percent of LEAs expecting funding cuts are likely to reduce instructional supplies or equipment, 73 \npercent are likely to defer maintenance, 71 percent are likely to reduce energy consumption, and 50 percent are \nlikely to reduce custodial services. (See figure 6.) For example, LEA officials in Elk Grove Unified School District \nsaid they were very likely to reduce the purchase of instructional supplies-or have already reduced them-and noted \nthat this may result in teachers and parents voluntarily purchasing additional supplies for classrooms. In addition, \nLEA officials in Kingston Community Schools, Plymouth Educational Center in Michigan, Elk Grove Unified School \nDistrict, and Boston Public Schools told us they had been deferring maintenance and would continue to defer it, \nthough they would not defer any maintenance that would compromise the safety of children. Examples of deferred \nmaintenance projects included painting rooms, replacing a roof, promptly This figure shows the personnel actions \nthat LEAs that anticipated funding decreases reporting being likely to take during the 2010-2011 school year\n\nRecovery Act fixing air conditioners, and resurfacing parking lots. LEA officials in Boston Public Schools and Elk \nGrove Unified School District said they were very likely to reduce energy consumption through such efforts as \nlowering the temperature in schools in winter months, offering incentives to schools with lower energy consumption, \n\n\n\nand using more energy- efficient light bulbs. Officials in Boston Public Schools, San Bernardino City Unified School \nDistrict, and Elk Grove Unified School District said they had reduced custodial services in their schools and some \nwould likely further reduce them. Smaller proportions of schools reported being likely to reduce transportation, \nshorten the school year, or close or consolidate schools. A Boston Public Schools official told us the district planned \nto reduce transportation costs by creating smaller transportation zones, and also hopes to close and consolidate up \nto 20 schools to reduce costs. In addition, we found that significantly higher percentages of the largest LEAs \nreported being likely to reduce transportation services. Specifically, 50 percent of large LEAs reported being likely \nto reduce transportation services, compared to 35 percent of all other LEAs\n\nRecovery Act Figure 6 Likely Nonpersonnel Actions for School Year 2010-2011 Reported by LEAs Expecting \nFunding Decreases, as Reported in Spring 2010 Note Percentage estimates have margins of error, at the 95 \npercent confidence level, of plus or minus 8 percentage points or less\n\naIn the case of shortening the school year, due to rounding, the sum of the percentage of LEAs shown as very likely \nand somewhat likely to take the action is 1 percentage point higher\n\nRecovery Act Funds Allowed Most LEAs to Retain or Create Teaching Positions and Related Jobs, though Some \nStill Lost Jobs in School Year 2009-2010 Recovery Act funds for education allowed over three-quarters of LEAs to \nretain or create teaching positions and related jobs during the 2009-2010 school year, though some LEAs still \nreported losing jobs even with the additional federal funding. The use of the Recovery Act funding for these \npurposes is consistent with one of the primary goals of the Recovery Act, which is to save and create jobs in order \nto help economic recovery. An This figure shows the nonpersonnel actions that LEAs that anticipated funding \ndecreases reporting being likely to take during the 2010-2011 school year\n\nRecovery Act 44This difference from the national average is statistically significant\n\nestimated 87 percent of LEAs across the country reported that Recovery Act funding allowed them to retain or \ncreate jobs. Specifically, a higher percentage of LEAs reported retaining staff positions-77 percent-than creating \nnew staff positions -39 percent-for the 2009-2010 school year\n\nIn addition, a significantly higher percentage of large LEAs reported that Recovery Act funding allowed them to \nretain school staff, with nearly all- 98 percent of the largest LEAs in the country-reporting using Recovery Act \nfunding for retention.44 While most LEAs were able to retain or create jobs with Recovery Act funding, some of \nthese LEAs-nearly 1 in 4-still reported losing jobs overall in their LEA in the 2009-2010 school year. (See fig. 7.)\n\nRecovery Act Figure 7 Estimated Percentage of LEAs Nationally That Reported Recovery Act Funding Allowed Job \nCreation or Retention Compared to the Estimated Percentage of LEAs That Reported Losing Jobs Even with the \nAdditional Funding in School Year 2009-2010, as Reported in Spring 2010 Notes Percentage estimates have \nmargins of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 5 percentage points or less. These columns \nare not mutually exclusive almost all LEAs with a net decrease in jobs also retained jobs (92 percent)\n\nRetaining jobs was top use of Recovery Act funds for three education programs LEAs used large portions of their \nRecovery Act IDEA Part B; ESEA Title I, Part A; and SFSF education stabilization funds toward staff retention in the \n2009-2010 school year. According to our survey, nearly 70 percent of LEAs spent more than half to all of their \nRecovery Act SFSF education stabilization funds to retain jobs for the 2009-2010 school year. (See fig. 8.) Although \na smaller percentage of LEAs reported using half to all of their IDEA Part B and ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act \nfunding-25 percent and 27 percent, respectively-for job retention, retaining staff was still the top use cited by LEAs \nfor IDEA Part B and ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act funding. For example, LEA officials in Kingston Community \nSchool District told us they had used all of their Recovery Act SFSF education stabilization funds and ESEA Title I,\n\nRecovery Act 45U.S. Department of Education, The Condition of Education 2010 (June 2010), page 278\n\n46The national estimate of 6.2 million education staff is based on 2007-08 school year data and is taken from \nEducation's 2009 Digest of Education Statistics, (p.56). The 4 percent of the workforce estimate is GAO's \n\n\n\ncalculation based on Education's 6.2 million staff estimate and employment projections by the U.S. Bureau of Labor \nStatistics\n\nPart A funds, and most of their Recovery Act IDEA Part B, funds to retain staff\n\nFigure 8 Estimated Percentage of LEAs Nationally That Used More Than Half of SFSF, ESEA Title I, Part A; and \nIDEA Part B Recovery Act Funding for Retaining Staff in School Year 2009-2010 Note Percentage estimates have \nmargins of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 6 percentage points or less\n\nA number of factors may explain why such a large percentage of LEAs spent a significant amount of their Recovery \nAct funding for job retention\n\nFor example, a large portion of school expenditures are employee- related costs-with salaries and benefits \naccounting for more than 80 percent of local school expenditures, according to Education's most recent data.45 \nAlso, given the fiscal uncertainty and substantial budget shortfalls facing states, federal funds authorized by the \nRecovery Act have provided LEAs with additional flexibility to pay for the retention of education staff\n\nOverall, the impact of Recovery Act education funds on job retention may be significant because K-12 public school \nsystems employ about 6.2 million staff, based on Education's estimates, and make up about 4 percent of the \nnation's workforce.46 In fact, through the reporting period ending June 30, 2010, nearly two-thirds of full-time \nequivalent positions reported on Recovery.gov have resulted from Recovery Act education programs\n\nThis figure presents the estimated percentage of LEAs nationally that used more than half of SFSF, ESEA Title I \nPart A and IDEA Part B Recovery Act Funding for retaining staff in school year 2009-2010. This figure shows that a \nlarger percentage of LEAs reported using Recovery Act SFSF funding for staff retention compared to the \npercentage of LEAs that used Recovery Act Title I Part A and IDEA Part B Recovery Act funding for this purpose\n\nRecovery Act Based on our visits to states and LEAs, we were told that Recovery Act SFSF funds, in particular, \nhave provided additional resources and flexibility allowing LEAs to retain staff. For example, one state education \nofficial noted that LEAs have more flexibility in spending SFSF funds for general education expenses because \nESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA Part B programs target special populations-disadvantaged youth and students with \ndisabilities, respectively. This official said that because funding levels for general education programs in his state \nhave decreased while federal funding levels for ESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA Part B programs have increased, \nLEAs have used SFSF funds to shore up funding for general education and, in particular, preserve jobs\n\nInstructional positions were more often retained and created than noninstructional positions Substantially more \nLEAs retained or created positions for instructional staff compared to noninstructional staff positions for the 2009-\n2010 school year. Instructional staff typically includes classroom teachers and paraprofessionals and \nnoninstructional staff can include office support, janitorial staff, and school security staff\n\nSpecifically, an estimated 74 percent of LEAs nationally retained jobs for instructional staff, compared to 48 percent \nthat retained them for noninstructional staff. Furthermore, 33 percent of LEAs reported creating new instructional \nstaff positions with Recovery Act funding compared to the 22 percent that created them for noninstructional staff. \n(See fig. 9)\n\nAccording to a number of LEA officials we interviewed, LEAs often spent Recovery Act funding in ways that would \nbenefit students directly in the classroom, thereby focusing on creating and retaining positions for instructional staff \nbefore creating and retaining jobs for noninstructional staff, such as administrative and auxiliary staff. For example, \nofficials from the Plymouth Educational Center said that in order to minimize the impact on students, they have \nmade or would consider making cuts to administration, security guards, and paraprofessionals, and instituting \nfurther pay cuts before letting go of teachers\n\n\n\nRecovery Act Figure 9 Estimated Percentage of LEAs Nationally That Retained and Created Instructional and \nNoninstructional Jobs in School Year 2009- 2010 Note Percentage estimates have margins of error, at the 95 \npercent confidence level, of plus or minus 6 percentage points or less. These categories are not mutually exclusive\n\nFewer LEAs Used Large Portions of Their Recovery Act Funding to Hire Staff Than to Retain Staff, although Fund \nUse for Hiring Varied by Program Although our survey results indicate that LEAs overall spent a significant amount \nof their Recovery Act funding from all three programs to retain jobs, LEAs also reported using Recovery Act \nfunding to hire new staff. As indicated in figure 10, the percentage of LEAs that reported using Recovery Act \nfunding to hire new staff varied across the three programs\n\nFor example, 4 percent and 6 percent of LEAs reported spending half or more of their Recovery Act IDEA Part B \nand SFSF funding, respectively, to hire new staff, while 15 percent of LEAs reported the same use for their \nRecovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A funds. Overall, nearly three-quarters of LEAs did not use any of their Recovery \nAct SFSF funding to hire new staff, concentrating instead on using that funding for staff retention\n\nThis figure is presented to show the estimated percentage of LEAs nationally that retained or created instructional \nand noninstructional jobs in the 2009-2010 school year. This figure shows that more LEAs used the Recovery Act \nfunding to retain jobs for instructional staff than for retaining jobs for noninstructional staff or for creating jobs for \ninstructional and noninstructional staff\n\nRecovery Act Figure 10 Estimated Percentage of LEAs That Reported Spending Recovery Act Funds to Hire New \nStaff in the 2009-2010 School Year, by Percent of Recovery Act Funding and Program Note Percentage estimates \nhave margins of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 7 percentage points or less\n\nNearly One in Four LEAs Reported Losing Jobs, Even with Recovery Act Funding, Due to Decreasing Budgets and \nOther Factors Even with the additional Recovery Act funding provided to LEAs in school year 2009- 2010, nearly \none-quarter of LEAs reported losing jobs, primarily due to decreasing overall budgets. Without Recovery Act funds, \nit is likely that the magnitude of job losses in these LEAs would have been higher, given that nearly all of the LEAs \nexperiencing job loss overall also reported retaining jobs. Specifically, an estimated 92 percent of LEAs where LEA \nofficials indicated the number of teachers had decreased also said that Recovery Act funds had allowed them to \nretain jobs during the This figure depicts the estimated percentage of LEAs reporting spending Recovery Act \nFunds to hire new staff in the 2009-2010 school year, by percent of Recovery Act Funding and by program. This \nfigure shows the percentage of LEAs that used various percentages of Recovery Act funding for to create new staff \npositions\n\nRecovery Act school year. Also, almost 30 percent of LEAs used Recovery Act funds to create new jobs during the \n2009-2010 school year, even as their overall number of jobs decreased. For example, according to a Boston Public \nSchools official, the number of staff in the district had decreased in the 2009-2010 school year, but the district also \nused Recovery Act funds for both retention and job creation. For example, the district hired 16 new English as a \nSecond Language teachers and specialists with ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act funds even as they let go of \nteachers during school closures\n\nDecreasing overall budgets at the LEA level was the main reason that LEAs reported losing jobs in School Year \n2009-2010. Specifically, 67 percent of LEAs that lost jobs reported that their budget was a factor to a great or very \ngreat degree. (See fig. 11.) For example, officials from Elk Grove Unified School District in California told us they \nlaid off about 500 staff at the end of the 2009-2010 school year due to budgetary pressures, after exhausting their \nreserves and spending Recovery Act funds. In addition to budgetary factors, LEAs lost jobs because of staff attrition \nand declining enrollment, although to a much lesser extent\n\nRecovery Act Figure 11 The Factors Affecting a Decrease in the Number of Jobs for the 2009- 2010 School Year to \na Great or Very Great Degree Note Percentage estimates for totals of very great and great degree have margins of \nerror, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 12 percentage points or less\n\n\n\nThis figure depicts the factors that LEAs reported affected a decrease in the number of jobs for the LEA in school \nyear 2009-2010 to a great or very great degree. This figure shows that LEA budgets were the primary factor \naffecting jobs declines for LEAs.\n\nRecovery Act 47For Recovery Act SFSF funds, a slightly higher percentage of LEAs reported using the funds to \nprovide transportation (1.8 percent) and school construction/renovation (3.7 percent) than professional development\n\nRecovery Act Funds Were Used by LEAs to Purchase Items That Will Build Capacity without Creating Recurring \nCosts In addition to retaining and hiring staff, LEAs spent Recovery Act funds on items that could help build long-\nterm capacity, while also avoiding creating recurring costs for LEAs. Overall, LEAs reported several one-time \nexpenditures such as purchasing computer technology, providing professional development for instructional staff, \nand purchasing instructional materials as among some of the highest uses of funds after job retention and \ncreation.47 (See fig. 12.)

Superintendents \nand other LEA officials we spoke with explained that \"level of service\" includes the instructional program provided to \nstudents through teaching staff, curriculum, and instructional materials; the noninstructional services provided in \nschool districts such as administrative and janitorial services; and the safety and security of schools\n\nLEA officials reported making one-time purchases with Recovery Act funds to enhance district capacity. For \nexample, at Plymouth Educational Center in Michigan, officials told us that Recovery Act funds were used to \nenhance computer technology for both students and teachers. Further, several LEA officials told us they had used \nIDEA Part B Recovery Act funds to purchase professional development and assistive technologies that would help \nbuild the district's capacity to serve more students with disabilities. These officials told us that they will be able to \neducate students with disabilities far more affordably within the district than by paying external providers-a benefit \nthey anticipate will continue even after the Recovery Act funds are spent. For example, in rural Michigan, officials \ntold us that IDEA Part B funding has allowed the Kingston Community Schools to build capacity by partnering, \nalong with other schools from the surrounding area, with the University of Kansas to provide coaching and training \nto teachers who can then provide services to more students with disabilities. In addition, LEA officials in Boston, \nMassachusetts, said they had used these funds to obtain equipment and provide professional development so they \ncould serve more students with autism within the district\n\nA Majority of LEAs Maintained the Same Level of Service as the Prior Year, but Some LEAs Reported Not Being \nAble to Maintain Service Levels Although more than half of all LEAs reported being able to provide students with \nthe same level of service in 2009-2010 as in 2008-2009, a number of LEAs reported they had not been able to \nmaintain the same level of service at their LEA for the same time frame.48 Specifically, an estimated 63 percent of \nLEAs nationally reported that Recovery Act SFSF funds allowed them to maintain the same level of service to \nstudents in their LEA in school year 2009- 2010 as compared to the previous school year. However, 40 percent of \nthe largest LEAs reported not being able to maintain the same level of service compared to 16 percent of all other \nLEAs. (See fig. 13.)\n\nRecovery Act Figure 13 Reported Changes in LEA Level of Service in School Year 2009-2010 Compared to Level \nof Service in 2008-2009 among LEAs Receiving SFSF Funds, by Size of LEA Note Percentage estimates have \nmargins of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 7 percentage points or less\n\n\n\nLEAs reported a range of areas in which there was a great or very great reduction in the level of services, including \ninstructional materials and resources, staff development, and summer school programs. For example, LEA officials \nfrom San Bernardino City Unified School District told us they had applied cuts with the intent of having the least \nimpact on children in the classroom, and that these cuts included delay of new textbook adoption, administrative \nreductions, and reduced maintenance. Further, Boston Public Schools and Revere Public Schools pointed to cuts in \nprogramming such as art and music as examples in how their service levels had decreased\n\nA number of LEAs reported that Recovery Act SFSF funds allowed them to raise their level of service in 2009-\n2010, with a lower percentage of the largest LEAs reporting raising service levels compared to all other LEAs\n\nThis figure depicts the reported changes in LEA level of service in school year 2009-2010 compared to level of \nservice in 2008-2009 among LEAs that received Recovery Act SFSF Funds by size of LEA. This figure shows that \nalthough more than half of all LEAs reported being able to provide students with the same level of service in 2009-\n2010 as in 2008-2009, a number of LEAs reported they had not been able to maintain the level of service at their \nLEA for the same time frame\n\nRecovery Act Based on our survey results for the 2009-2010 school year, 20 percent of all LEAs indicated that the \nadditional Recovery Act SFSF funding made it possible to raise the level of services provided to students compared \nto what the LEA was able to provide in the prior 2008-2009 school year. A significantly lower percentage of the \nlargest LEAs in the country-5 percent-specified that the SFSF funding raised service levels in their schools\n\nRelatively Few LEAs Report Making Significant Progress in Four Core Education Reforms Some LEAs report \nmaking modest progress in education reform, but relatively few report they are making significant progress in \nadvancing the four core education reform areas states are required to address as a condition of receiving SFSF \nfunding. For example, an estimated 28 percent of LEAs reported making modest progress and just 13 percent of \nLEAs reported making significant progress in increasing teacher effectiveness- the highest percentage among the \nfour areas. (See fig. 14.) However, some of these goals, such as improving standards and assessments, are more \nlikely to be pursued at the state level than at the local level, while others, such as supporting struggling schools, \nmay not apply to all districts. In order to receive SFSF funding, states had to submit an application to Education that \nrequired each state to provide several assurances, including that it would implement strategies to advance four core \nareas of education reform, as described by Education (1) increase teacher effectiveness and address inequities in \nthe distribution of highly qualified teachers; (2) establish a pre- K-through-college data system to track student \nprogress and foster improvement; (3) make progress toward rigorous college- and career- ready standards and \nhigh-quality assessments that are valid and reliable for all students, including students with limited English \nproficiency and students with disabilities; and (4) provide targeted, intensive support and effective interventions to \nturn around schools identified for corrective action or restructuring. Furthermore, in order to receive the remainder \nof their SFSF allocations (Phase II), states had to agree to collect and publicly report on more than 30 indicators \nand descriptors related to the four core areas of education reform described above. While states will be responsible \nfor assuring advancement of these reform areas, LEAs were generally given broad discretion in how to spend the \nSFSF funds. It is not clear how LEA progress in advancing these four reforms will affect states' progress toward \nmeeting their assurances Education officials noted that they were not surprised that fewer LEAs reported \nexpanding reform efforts in 2009-2010 given their budget situation. Figure 14 depicts the extent to which LEAs \nreported making modest or significant progress in each of the four reform areas\n\nRecovery Act 49In April 2009, Education released guidance that asked LEA officials to consider whether their \nproposed use of Recovery Act funds would (1) improve results for students, including students in poverty, students \nwith disabilities, and English language learners; (2) increase educators' long-term capacity to improve results for \nstudents; (3) advance state, district, or school improvement plans and the reform goals encompassed in the \nRecovery Act; (4) avoid recurring costs that states, school systems, and schools are unprepared to assume when \nthis funding ends; and (5) include approaches to measure and track implementation and results. See American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Using ARRA Funds to Drive School Reform and Improvement U.S. \nDepartment of Education Washington D.C.

These categories are not mutually exclusive\n\nEducation Reform Efforts under ESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA Part B Were Maintained or Expanded in the 2009-\n2010 School Year, but a Small and Growing Number of LEAs Expect Declines in 2010-2011 Almost all LEAs we \nsurveyed stated that ESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA Part B Recovery Act funds allowed their LEAs to either expand \nor maintain education reform efforts in 2009-2010, but a small and increasing percentage of LEAs expect to reduce \nreform efforts in 2010-2011 than reduced such efforts in 2009-2010. In addition to retaining and creating jobs, \nEducation officials reported they intended the use of Recovery Act funds to spur education reform in LEAs to \nimprove student achievement.49 Education provided guidance to states and LEAs on ways to use the This figure is \npresented to show the percentage of LEAs that reported significant or modest progress towards education reform \ngoals in school year 2009-2010. This figure shows that while some LEAs report making modest progress in \neducation reform, relatively few report they are making significant progress in advancing the four core education \nreform areas states are required to address as a condition of receiving SFSF funding\n\nRecovery Act Recovery Act funds to stimulate reform, as well as to retain jobs. Because LEAs are required to \nobligate 85 percent of their Title I, Part A Recovery Act funding by September 30, 2010, unless approved for a \nwaiver, Title I, Part A education reform efforts in districts without waivers could decrease because fewer funds \nwould be available in the upcoming school year\n\nESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act Funding Enhanced Education Reform Efforts at Nearly Half of All LEAs and \nHelped Enhance or Maintain Reform at Nearly All LEAs Most LEAs report that Recovery Act funding for ESEA Title \nI, Part A allowed them to either expand or maintain education reforms for disadvantaged students in both 2009- \n2010 and 2010-2011, but the percentage of districts that expect to expand reform is lower for 2010-2011 than for \nthe 2009-2010. According to our survey results, an estimated 48 percent of LEAs indicated that the additional ESEA \nTitle I, Part A Recovery Act funding they received allowed their LEA to expand education reform efforts in 2009-\n2010. For example, officials from one Michigan LEA told us they used the ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act funding \nto enhance a tutoring program for all at-risk students in math and language arts. Officials at another LEA told us the \nESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act funding allowed them to enhance their after-school tutoring program targeted at \nEnglish language learners. Moreover, an additional 48 percent of LEAs stated that the funding allowed them to \nmaintain reform efforts for ESEA Title I, Part A programs. However, the percentage of districts anticipating ESEA \nTitle I, Part A funding that will allow their district to expand reform efforts is lower for the 2010-2011 school year \nthan for the 2009-2010 school year. (See fig. 15) While an estimated 3 percent of LEAs stated that even with the \nadditional Recovery Act funding provided under ESEA Title I, Part A, education reform efforts decreased in the \n2009-2010 school year, this percentage increased to 11 percent when we asked LEAs to look ahead to the 2010- \n2011 school year. Title I, Part A reform efforts could potentially decrease in the coming school year, in part because \nLEAs are required to obligate 85 percent of ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act funds by September 30, 2010, unless \nthey receive a waiver\n\nRecovery Act Figure 15 Percentage of LEAs Nationally Reporting ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act Funds Have \nExpanded, Maintained, or Decreased Education Reform Efforts in School Years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, as \nReported in Spring 2010 Notes Percentage estimates have margins of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of \nplus or minus 7 percentage points or less.,This figure does not display the percentage of LEAs that chose \"Don't \nKnow\" as a survey response, and therefore, the percentages do not total to 100 percent\n\nIDEA Part B Recovery Act Funding Allowed Most LEAs to Either Expand or Maintain Reform Efforts for Special \nEducation Students Most LEAs report that Recovery Act funding for IDEA Part B allowed them to either expand or \nmaintain education reform efforts for special education students in both 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, but the \npercentage of districts that expect to expand reform is lower for 2010-2011 than for the previous year. Specifically, \nin 2009-2010, we estimate that 43 percent of LEAs nationally expanded reform efforts for special education \nstudents because of the additional IDEA Part B Recovery Act funding in 2009-2010\n\n\n\n(See fig. 16). For example, an official in Boston, Massachusetts, told us that the Boston Public Schools has used \nsome of its IDEA Part B Recovery Act funding to train teachers and purchase equipment to enhance classroom \nservices for autistic students. In addition, 55 percent of LEAs noted that the Recovery Act funding allowed them to \nmaintain ongoing education reform efforts targeted for special education students in the same year. For example, in \nMichigan, one LEA official we interviewed stated that the LEA had used Recovery Act funding to maintain \nintervention services for special education students. Looking ahead to the 2010-2011 school year, however, a lower \npercentage of districts-28 percent-expect to expand reform\n\nThis figure is presented to show the percentage of LEAs nationally that reported that ESEA Title I Part A Recovery \nAct funding has allowed or will allow the LEA to expand, maintain or decrease education reform efforts in school \nyears 2009-2010 and 2010-2011\n\nRecovery Act 50Hereafter in this section, \"local\" will refer to \"local, or state and local\" funds\n\nFigure 16 Percentage of LEAs Nationally with IDEA Part B Recovery Act Funds That Reported Expanding, \nMaintaining, or Decreasing Reform Efforts for Special Education Students in School Years 2009- 2010 and 2010-\n2011, as Reported in Spring 2010 Notes Percentage estimates have margins of error, at the 95 percent confidence \nlevel, of plus or minus 7 percentage points or less.This figure does not display the percentage of LEAs that chose \n\"Don't Know\" as a survey response, and therefore, the percentages do not total to 100 percent\n\nGiven the Increase in IDEA Recovery Act Funding in 2009-2010, about 36 Percent of LEAs Exercised Flexibility to \nDecrease Local Spending on Special Education, and Primarily Used Funds to Retain Staff In the 2009-2010 school \nyear, among the 86 percent of LEAs that reported receiving Recovery Act IDEA Part B funds, an estimated 36 \npercent reported taking advantage of the maintenance-of-effort (MOE) flexibility under IDEA that allows them to \nreduce their local, or state and local,50 spending on students with disabilities. IDEA requires LEAs to budget at \nleast the same total or per capita amount of local funds for the education of children with disabilities as the LEA \nspent in the most recent prior year for which information is available. As provided for in IDEA, in any fiscal year in \nwhich an LEA's federal IDEA Part B allocation exceeds the amount This figure is presented to show the percentage \nof LEAs nationally that reported that IDEA Part B Recovery Act funding has allowed or will allow the LEA to \nexpand, maintain or decrease education reform efforts in school years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011\n\nRecovery Act 51To be eligible to exercise this flexibility, the LEA must meet the requirements of IDEA, Part B, \nincluding meeting targets in its state's performance plan. In 2009, almost all of the states in our sample had an \nincrease in the number of LEAs that met requirements-and were therefore eligible-compared to the prior year. For \nmore information, see GAO, Recovery Act Status of States' and Localities' Use of Funds and Efforts to Ensure \nAccountability, GAO-10-231 (Washington, D.C. Dec. 10, 2009)\n\n52SCSD's application to the state for IDEA funds actually reported an increase in funding for the 2009-2010 school \nyear of $125,793. However, this increase was reported in error\n\nthe LEA received in the previous year, an eligible LEA51 may reduce local spending on students with disabilities by \nup to 50 percent of the amount of the increase, as long as the LEA uses those freed-up funds for activities \nauthorized under ESEA, which supports activities for general education\n\nBecause Recovery Act funds for IDEA Part B count as part of an LEA's overall federal IDEA allocation, in fiscal year \n2009, the total increase in IDEA Part B funding for LEAs was far larger than the increases in previous years, which \nprovided a greater incentive for many LEAs to take advantage of the MOE flexibility in the 2009-2010 school year. \nOf the 36 percent of LEAs exercising the flexibility, an estimated 41 percent reported spending more than half of \nthe \"freed- up\" local funds on retaining staff. Other uses of the freed-up funds included providing professional \ndevelopment for instructional staff, purchasing computer technology, and hiring new staff\n\nWe also found an example of an LEA that planned to take advantage of the MOE flexibility even though it was not \neligible to do so. Based on our review of budget documents and local officials' statements, the Syracuse City \nSchool District (SCSD) had reduced their 2009-2010 spending by about $2.3 million.52 We determined, and local \n\n\n\nofficials subsequently agreed, that SCSD was not eligible for the MOE reduction because it was not meeting \nperformance indicators related to graduation and drop-out rates among disabled students and it had a significantly \nhigh percentage of students with disabilities being suspended for more than 10 days, among other indicators. When \nwe notified LEA officials of its ineligibility during our visit in March 2010, they attributed their situation to \nmiscommunication among staff in the special education and finance offices and a misunderstanding of the \neligibility rules for reducing MOE\n\nLEA officials informed us that they would follow up on this issue and take steps to ensure they met MOE \nrequirements. SCSD subsequently provided documentation showing that they were indeed meeting MOE \nrequirements\n\nRecovery Act 53This amount includes both Phase I and Phase II SFSF education stabilization funds\n\nWhile the decision by LEAs to decrease their local spending can free up funds to address other needs in the current \nschool year, it could also have implications for future local spending on special education. Because LEAs are \nrequired to maintain their previous year's level of local spending on special education and related services to \ncontinue to receive IDEA Part B funds, LEAs taking advantage of the spending flexibility will only be required to \nmaintain these expenditures at the reduced level in subsequent years. If LEAs that use the flexibility to decrease \ntheir local spending do not voluntarily increase their spending in future years, and federal IDEA Part B allocations \ndecrease-specifically by returning to levels comparable to those before the Recovery Act-the total federal, state, \nand local spending for the education of students with disabilities will decrease compared to overall spending before \nthe Recovery Act. However, while LEAs may maintain the lower level of spending, because of the IDEA \nrequirement that children with disabilities receive a \"free appropriate public education,\" (FAPE) districts may not be \nable to maintain services for students with disabilities at the lower levels of spending. For example, in Elk Grove \nUnified School District (California), which reduced local spending in 2009-2010, local officials reported that they \nhave plans to include in their budget for 2010-2011 an amount equal to or greater than their 2008-2009 spending to \nensure that services to students with disabilities are maintained. Officials said they needed to do this in order to \nmaintain services for students with disabilities. In contrast, a charter school in Michigan reported that it may not be \nable to restore funding to previous years' levels, given decreases in state funding, but would make sure it provided \nservices for students with disabilities\n\nStates Vary in the Rate at Which They Draw Down Recovery Act Funds for Education Programs As of August 27, \n2010, states covered by our review had drawn down 72 percent ($18.2 billion) of the awarded SFSF education \nstabilization funds;53 46 percent ($3.0 billion) of Recovery Act funds for ESEA Title I, Part A; and 45 percent ($3.4 \nbillion) of Recovery Act funds for IDEA Part B. Some states had drawn down a much larger portion of their funds \nthaother states. (See table 6.) For example, Arizona, Georgia, Illinois and Jersey had drawn down all of their SFSF \neducation stabilization funds as of August 27, 2010, while Florida, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Texas had drawn \ndown less than 55 percent of these funds\n\nRecovery Act Table 6 Percentage of Awarded SFSF Education Stabilization, ESEA Title I Part A, and IDEA Part B \nRecovery Act Funds Drawn Down by Selected States as of August 27, 2010 State Percentage of awarded \nRecovery Act funds drawn down SFSF EducationStabilization Funds ESEA Title I, Part A IDEA Part B Arizona 100 \n48 45 California 87 52 49 Colorado 86 34 36 District of Columbia 82 13 10 Florida 50 46 50 Georgia 100 38 41 \nIllinois 100 56 52 Iowa 93 95 84 Massachusetts 87 45 46 Michigan 85 40 44 Mississippi 50 41 33 New Jersey 100 \n34 38 New York 56 36 31 North Carolina 56 49 52 Ohio 56 42 52 Pennsylvania 52 58 49 Texas 42 47 43 Total 72 \n46 45 Source U.S. Department of Education\n\nAs noted in a previous report, drawdowns typically lag behind actual expenditures. For example, state officials in \nNew Jersey stated that drawdown figures lag expenditures because funds are only drawn down once districts \nsubmit for reimbursement. However, because LEAs are required to obligate 85 percent of ESEA Title I Recovery \nAct funds by September 30, 2010, a low drawdown rate could indicate either that a large percentage of districts \nhave sought and obtained or will seek and obtain waivers from this requirement or are at risk of not meeting this \nrequirement. To help mitigate the effects of the funding cliff- when Recovery Act funding is no longer available-\n\n\n\nEducation officials are encouraging districts to use carryover waivers to spread ESEA Title I, Part A funds over 2 \nyears. Specifically, in a webinar Education officials hosted on June 15, 2010, Education officials explained how \ndistricts could minimize the impact of the funding cliff by strategically using carryover waivers. Also, officials in \nstates we contacted appeared to be following\n\nRecovery Act 54These states are Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York\n\n55These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New \nJersey, New York, and Texas\n\nEducation's suggested strategy to encourage the use of carryover waivers\n\nWe spoke to state officials in five states and the District of Columbia with relatively low drawdown rates54 and some \nof these officials told us they were encouraging districts to spread the funds over the 2-year period rather than try to \nobligate 85 percent of the funds by September 30, 2010\n\nFor example, Massachusetts state officials told us they have encouraged all districts receiving Recovery Act Title I \nfunds to apply for a carryover waiver to allow them the flexibility to use Recovery Act funds throughout the two-year \nperiod. Similarly, officials in New York state told us they had requested a blanket waiver for all districts in the state, \nwhich was approved by Education\n\nEducation Is Continuing to Provide Technical Assistance and Guidance and Is Monitoring States' Use of Recovery \nAct Funds Education has completed 16 of the 18 on site-monitoring visits it scheduled for the 2009-2010 monitoring \ncycle (including 11 states and the District of Columbia that are in our review),55 according to department officials. \nThe most frequent monitoring findings related to the Recovery Act had to do with districts failing to follow fiscal and \nset-aside requirements, such as the requirements to document time and effort of employees paid with Title I, Part A \nfunds and properly calculate how much funding was required to be set aside for specific purposes, according to \nEducation officials. Regarding fiscal requirement findings, the most frequent findings included districts' failure to (1) \ndetermine whether services provided in schools receiving ESEA Title I, Part A funding were comparable to those \nservices provided to students in other district schools not receiving ESEA Title I, Part A funding, (2) determine \nwhether federal funding had been used to \"supplant\" local or state funds by paying for services that had previously \nbeen provided using local or state funds, or (3) document that employees funded through multiple funding sources \nwere dedicating the appropriate proportion of their time and effort to serving disadvantaged students. Regarding \nset-aside calculations, Education officials said that they found that some districts had not included Recovery Act \nfunding in their calculations as required. Education officials provided examples of corrective actions state \neducational agencies and LEAs with fiscal or set-aside calculation findings could take to resolve these issues. For \nexample, calculations for comparability or set- asides could be corrected to comply with requirements\n\nRecovery Act 56Mississippi and Pennsylvania are scheduled to be monitored in the 2010-2011 monitoring cycle\n\n57OSEP officials indicated that the desk review's content would include questions based on the Department of \nEducation Inspector General's recent findings. See U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, \nFinal Management Information Report, ED- OIG/X05J0019 (Washington, D.C., June 4, 2010)\n\nFor the 2010-2011 monitoring cycle, Education officials plan to conduct on-site visits in 11 states, including 2 in our \nreview,56 and the Bureau of Indian Education. During each of these 12 monitoring visits, Education officials will \nassess state and local implementation of the School Improvement Grant program in addition to the implementation \nof regular and Recovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A requirements. Department officials said that during the upcoming \nmonitoring cycle, they will continue to shift their monitoring focus away from strict audits towards providing technical \nassistance. Department officials also told us that they will develop state- specific technical assistance for the states \nreviewed during the 2009- 2010 monitoring cycle to help them resolve identified challenges\n\n\n\nEducation officials told us they continue to engage state and local officials using a variety of technical assistance \nefforts. Such efforts include issuing written guidance, hosting webinars, and giving presentations at state ESEA Title \nI conferences to explain and discuss federal guidance\n\nEducation officials also noted that they constantly communicate with state and local officials over the telephone and \nthrough email, and issue frequently asked questions to share their answers to questions from state and local \nofficials. Department officials also noted that they have offered state-specific technical assistance to state and local \nofficials in several states, particularly in states with new ESEA Title I leaders. Some of these technical assistance \nefforts have been initiated as a direct result of the Recovery Act, according to Education officials, who also said that \nthe increased technical assistance efforts have created a strain on their resources and capacity\n\nEducation Continues to Address Recovery Act Issues within Its Ongoing IDEA Monitoring Efforts Regarding IDEA, \nin the fall of 2009, Education officials reported that they pursued their regular targeted monitoring visits and \ntechnical assistance, which covers 16 states or territories, and in response to the Recovery Act, Education's Office \nof Special Education Programs (OSEP) is also performing a desk review of all states.57 According to Education \nofficials,\n\nRecovery Act the department uses annual performance report information and focused monitoring priorities to \ndetermine in which states it will conduct monitoring visits. In the course of its monitoring visits, the department \nverifies the effectiveness of state systems for general supervision, data collection, and fiscal management, as well \nas reviews state progress toward the goals from its state performance plan. In conducting site visits, OSEP reviews \nstate records, makes visits to selected LEAs for on-site examination of student records, and assesses state special \neducation systems. Following these visits, Education issues a report on findings and, when noncompliance is \nfound, requires states to demonstrate correction of the noncompliance\n\nFor fall 2010, Education is pursuing some additional monitoring and providing additional support to states in \nimplementing the Recovery Act\n\nSpecifically, in addition to its annual monitoring visits, OSEP is planning to visit up to 10 additional states this year. \nThese additional visits will be less intensive than the regular monitoring visits, and will focus more on the Recovery \nAct than the annual monitoring visits. Also in response to the Recovery Act, the department has assigned four \nRecovery Act Facilitators, who work with four teams that will provide support and guidance to states regarding their \nRecovery Act monitoring efforts and the reporting of accurate data for recipient reporting under the Recovery Act\n\nWhile they did not have any Recovery Act-specific findings in their most recent monitoring visits, OSEP officials did \nreport some areas on which they will be focusing in their upcoming monitoring. OSEP officials reported that one of \nthe issues they have been focusing on for several years is ensuring timely obligation and expenditure of funds. After \nfinding 10 years ago that states had failed to obligate a total of $32.8 million in IDEA funds before the end of the 27-\nmonth timeframe required under the law, the department began to track state- level draw-downs, and now works to \nremind states that have balances above a certain threshold when the deadlines for obligating funds are \napproaching. OSEP officials reported that in subsequent years, after they began tracking drawdowns, the expired \nunobligated funds have declined to about $5.6 million. Also, OSEP officials reported that some states were \ncalculating their state-level MOE spending without including spending on special education from sources outside of \nthe state educational agency. For example, if other state departments are providing counseling or rehabilitation \nservices, that spending must be included. Finally, OSEP officials reported that while state education agencies \ngenerally require LEAs to provide a budget for their intended uses of IDEA funds, and require LEAs to attest that \nthey are complying with MOE requirements, states do not always perform\n\nRecovery Act 58According to guidance issued by Education, in general, to be able to use IDEA funds to purchase \nequipment, LEAs need to obtain the prior approval of the state. For purposes of this prior approval requirement, \n\"equipment\" is defined to mean an article of nonexpendable, tangible personal property having a useful life of more \nthan a year and an acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the \ngovernmental unit for financial statement purposes, or $5,000. See, U.S. Department of Education, Office of \n\n\n\nSpecial Education and Rehabilitative Services, Guidance on Funds for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act Made Available Under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Washington, D.C., \nApril 2009)\n\n59West Virginia's waiver application was also approved. In addition, Kansas received a partial approval. The state \nrequested to decrease spending on special education by $60 million, but Education approved a decrease of $44 \nmillion. There is no official appeals process, according to OSEP officials, although Kansas has reapplied, asking for \na decrease of $58 million. In addition, Education is currently considering a waiver application for South Carolina\n\nIn other examples, we found that the Des Moines Public School District purchased equipment for about $25,000, \nand the Marshalltown Community School District in Iowa purchased $8,400 in communications equipment and \nsoftware, without seeking review and approval from the state prior to purchase, as state officials said was required. \nAs we completed our reviews, the LEAs were making changes in their procedures to ensure state approval of IDEA \nequipment purchases greater than $5,000\n\nmonitoring later to ensure that LEAs can document that they spent the funds according to their budgets. In one \nexample, in Iowa, we found equipment purchases under IDEA larger than $5,000 for a single piece of equipment \nthat were not submitted to the state for approval as state officials reported was required.58 Given State-Level \nBudget Situations, Education Has Approved Waivers Allowing States to Decrease Their State Spending on Special \nEducation Because of declines in state-level budgets, Education has approved waiver applications from states to \ndecrease their state-level spending on special education. Under IDEA, the Secretary of Education may waive state-\nlevel MOE requirements for equitable purposes due to \"exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a \nnatural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State.\" Education approved \na state-level waiver for one state in our review-Iowa59-for 2009. Education officials said that the waiver will only \napply for 1 year, and, in 2010 Iowa must return its spending on special education to the 2009 level unless the state \napplies for and receives another waiver\n\nRecovery Act 60U.S. Department Of Education, Office Of Special Education And Rehabilitation Services, Process \nAnd Criteria Used To Evaluate A Request By States To Waive Maintenance Of Effort (MOE) Requirements Under \nPart B Of The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (Washington, D.C., June 2010)\n\n61Education has also conducted site visits in three states not included in our review- Maryland, South Carolina and \nTennessee\n\n62Education has also conducted desk reviews of three states not included in our review- Alaska, Delaware, and \nNorth Dakota\n\nEducation officials said that the department is considering each application individually based on its own merits, \nand is reminding states in its approval letters that they must provide services to students with disabilities that would \nstill meet the requirement under the law that the state provide a free appropriate public education, despite any cuts. \nIn a June 2010 memorandum, Education said that it was considering the impact of other sources of funding for \nspecial education, including those from the Recovery Act, when making waiver decisions.60 Education officials also \ntold us that they want to ensure that cuts to special education services are equitable when compared to other \nbudget cuts, and therefore they consider the percentage decrease in spending on special education in relation to \nthat of other items in the states' budget, both education-related and other items. Education's guidance also notes \nthat states that receive a waiver may be subject to additional monitoring, and Education officials told us that each of \nthe waiver-approved states will be among the 16 states chosen for full monitoring visits described above and \nsubject to additional monitoring to make sure that free appropriate public education was provided\n\nEducation Has Begun to Monitor SFSF Grantees and Address Initial Challenges Associated with Monitoring \nNoneducation State and Local Agencies Education has begun to monitor SFSF grantees, and as of August 30, \n2010 had conducted on-site monitoring of 1 state-New York- and Washington, D.C. included in our review61 as well \nas desk reviews of two states in our review62-Georgia and North Carolina. Education has not yet completed its \nmonitoring reports to states, but department officials told us that its findings were minor and that it would work with \n\n\n\nstates to address any findings. For example, Education officials told us that some of the minor findings included not \nproviding timely certification documents, ensuring that all jobs were reported on required recipient reports, or \nadhering to\n\nRecovery Act monitoring schedules of subrecipients. Education has 10 more on-site monitoring visits planned \nbetween September and November 2010 and 10 planned for 2011\n\nEducation officials reported some challenges they experienced during their initial monitoring visits because of the \ndiffering types of subrecipients and the amount of documentation to review. Education's Office of Elementary and \nSecondary Education (OESE) is charged with administering and monitoring SFSF funds. While OESE is \nexperienced with monitoring LEAs, SFSF educational stabilization funds may also flow to Institutions of Higher \nEducation, which OESE has little or no experience overseeing. Further, SFSF government services funds provide \nfunding to a broad range of state and local agencies that Education does not normally monitor. For example, SFSF \ngovernment services funds subrecipients consist of a variety of noneducational entities including state police forces, \nfire departments, corrections departments, and healthcare facilities and hospitals. Since this is the first SFSF \nmonitoring effort, Education officials told us that it will take time for Education's staff to become familiar with these \nsubrecipients and the types of documentation they provide. In addition, Education officials reported that the amount \nof information necessary to monitor SFSF funds was voluminous and required more time than was expected, but \nthey are continuing to work to improve the SFSF monitoring process\n\nIn September 2009, we reported that some states faced challenges in developing monitoring plans for SFSF funds, \nand we recommended that Education take action such as collecting and reviewing documentation of state \nmonitoring plans to ensure that states understand and fulfill their responsibility to monitor subrecipients of SFSF \nfunds. Education acted on our recommendation and required states to submit SFSF monitoring plans to Education \nby March 12, 2010. Education officials told us they are reviewing the plans to ensure that states planned to \nadequately monitor SFSF subrecipients\n\nGiven State-Level Budget Situations, Education Has Approved SFSF Waivers Allowing States to Decrease Their \nState Spending on Education The Secretary of Education has granted an SFSF MOE waiver to one state in our \nreview-New Jersey-allowing the state to reduce 2009 state\n\nRecovery Act 63Rhode Island was also granted a waiver for 2009 MOE requirements but was not included in our \nreview\n\n64See Pub.L. No. 111-5, 14012 (2009)\n\n65Rhode Island and South Carolina have also requested a waiver from Education to decrease their 2009 state-level \nspending on education\n\n66Education officials reported that as of August 20, 2010, Tennessee and Delaware have received their Race to \nthe Top grants. Hawaii, Maryland and Rhode Island are the other states that will also receive these grants\n\n67According to Education officials, $4 billion will be provided for statewide reform efforts and $350 million for state \nconsortia to develop common academic assessments. From the time grantees receive their awards, they will have \n4 years to spend the grant funds\n\n68Oklahoma's and Puerto Rico's Phase II applications have yet to be approved. Education officials reported they \nare working with these states and the outlying areas to ensure their plans for using Phase II SFSF funds adhere to \napplicable requirements\n\nAs we reported in May, the states we reviewed told us they met SFSF MOE levels in fiscal year 2009 or obtained \nwaivers. Because of declines in state-level budgets, two states in our review-Florida and New Jersey-requested a \nwaiver from Education to decrease their 2009 state-level spending on education\n\n\n\nsupport for education below 2006 levels.63 The department grants these waivers once a state certifies that state \neducation spending did not decrease as a percentage of total state revenues.6465 After these states' 2009 state \neducation funding figures were finalized, Education officials told us they reviewed waiver applications to ensure that \nstate education funding in 2009 met the requirements for an SFSF waiver. Education officials reported that New \nJersey's and Rhode Island's waivers have been approved and that they are currently reviewing South Carolina's \nand Florida's waivers\n\nEducation Announced Race to the Top Grants and SFSF Phase II Awards Education has announced that the \nDistrict of Columbia and 11 states, including Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, and Ohio, \nwill receive Race to the Top grants.66 This program is a competitive grant fund created by the Recovery Act as part \nof SFSF providing $4.35 billion in funding for statewide reform efforts and to develop common academic \nassessments.67 In addition, Education officials reported that almost all of the SFSF Phase II funds have been \nawarded to most states.68 As such, states now have access to their entire allotment of SFSF funds and all SFSF \nfunds must be obligated by September 30, 2011\n\nRecovery Act 69Pub.

Specifically, Education \nrecipients reported around 450,000 FTEs, which represent 60 percent of the nearly 750,000 FTEs reported for the \nperiod ending June 30, 2010. To improve the consistency of FTE data collected and reported, in May and March \n2010 GAO made several recommendations to Education, including that Education re-emphasize the responsibility \nof sub-recipients to include hours worked by vendors in their quarterly FTE calculations and that Education provide \nclarifying guidance to recipients on how to best calculate FTEs for education employees during quarters when \nschool is not in session. Education implemented our recommendations by issuing clarifying guidance on August 26, \n2010, that specifies how education sub- recipients are to calculate FTEs for recipient reporting for Education- \nspecific situations, such as how to calculate FTEs for teachers not working during the summer months who are \nconsidered full-time employees\n\nThough the Application Process Has Taken Longer Than Expected, States and LEAs Are Preparing to Implement \nSchool Improvement Grants as Soon as Applications Are Approved Setbacks in issuing final written guidance and \nresource constraints at Education have slowed the application process for School Improvement Grants (SIG)-\ncompetitive awards to help turn around the lowest performing schools-according to department officials. According \nto Education officials, one reason that the state application process took longer than expected was that the \ndepartment had to revise the final requirements it initially released in December 2009. According to Education \nofficials, some language in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 69 necessitated changes to these \nrequirements. Education officials released revised guidance in late January 2010 and again in June 2010 with a few \nadditional revisions.70 While the changes to the guidance and other delays created a challenge for some states, \nEducation assisted states in moving their applications forward by responding to questions in a timely manner. In \naddition, Education extended the application deadline set in the initial guidance document to allow time for the \ndepartment to\n\nRecovery Act 71These states are Massachusetts and New York\n\noffer technical assistance and for states to revise their applications given the changed requirements\n\nIn addition to the delay caused by issuing revised guidance, department officials said that staffing constraints had \nlimited the department's ability to review state applications, which ranged from 200 to 400 pages in length, and to \nhelp state officials revise these applications. They noted that, in some cases, states had to revise the application, \n\n\n\nsometimes more than once, in order to comply with SIG requirements. Because certain compliance issues related \nto more than one part of the application (depending on how states put their applications together), Education staff \nhad to reread each application in full after each resubmission to ensure compliance. Overseeing the substantial \ninflux of additional ESEA Title I funds provided through the Recovery Act, including SIG funds, substantially \nincreased staff workload, particularly given that staffing levels did not increase, said a senior Education official. \nWhile one staff member works full- time to coordinate the SIG application process at the department, the 17 other \nstaff who were assigned to work on SIG application reviews assumed these responsibilities in addition to their other \nmonitoring, technical assistance, and programmatic duties, according to a senior Education official\n\nState officials in some states71 and the District of Columbia told us that they had encountered various challenges in \napplying for and implementing the School Improvement Grants and that timeframes have been tight\n\nThese states were at different stages in the process of selecting LEAs to receive SIG funds, but were taking various \nsteps to address the tight timeframes and work through challenges, and expected that districts would be ready to \nuse the grant funds in the 2010-2011 school year. For example, officials in New York told us in late August that they \nhad nearly completed their review of districts' SIG applications. They also noted encountering challenges in New \nYork City, where school districts are not allowed to replace principals or close schools-steps required by certain \nschool turnaround models-and having to work through two specific collective bargaining issues. In contrast, New \nJersey officials said they had completed their review of district applications and selected 12 schools, representing 7 \nschool districts to receive SIG funds, with some districts receiving grants for multiple schools. To ease tight time \nframes, Michigan officials told us that while awaiting approval from Education, they had\n\nRecovery Act 72Funds are obligated when DOT issues project or grant agreements.

State education officials told us they \nreviewed these initial drafts and gave local officials feedback before the final applications were due. As of late July, \nEducation had approved SIG applications for 48 states and the District of Columbia, including all 16 of the states \nand the District of Columbia in our review\n\nObligations for State Transportation Projects Are Nearly Complete, but Spending from Other Federal Transportation \nSources Has Slowed Use of Transportation Funds Nationwide, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \nobligated $25.6 billion in Recovery Act funds for over 12,300 highway projects and reimbursed $11.1 billion as of \nAugust 2, 2010. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) obligated $8.76 billion of Recovery Act funds for about \n1,055 grants and reimbursed $3.6 billion as of August 5, 2010.72 Figure 17 shows FHWA's and FTA's \nreimbursements during the Recovery Act\n\nRecovery Act Figure 17 Cumulative Recovery Act Highway and Public Transportation Funds Reimbursed by FHWA \nand FTA Nationwide Nationally, 44 percent of funds obligated for highway projects had been reimbursed as of \nAugust 2, 2010. Reimbursement rates varied widely among the 16 states and the District-between 23 percent and \n77 percent\n\nIllinois, Iowa, and Mississippi had the highest reimbursement rates-each at 65 percent or more. Officials in all 3 \nstates told us that in selecting projects they emphasized projects that could be completed quickly, and each \nundertook more pavement resurfacing projects-which can be quickly initiated-than any of the other states we \nreviewed. Five states had reimbursement rates below 30 percent-of particular note, California, which received \nalmost 1 out of every 10 Recovery Act highway dollars apportioned nationwide, had the second lowest \nreimbursement rate among the 16 states and the District at 26 percent ($633 million). Officials from California noted \nthat the state had undertaken a number of large projects that had the potential to offer long-term benefits but for \n\n\n\nwhich construction could not be initiated quickly. For example, California used about $197 million in Recovery Act \nfunds to partially finance the Caldecott Tunnel improvement project (total estimated cost of $420 million)\n\nCalifornia awarded a contract in November 2009 and began construction of a new tunnel on a congested stretch of \nhighway between Oakland and This figure is presented to show the dollars of funds obligated for highway projects \nby the FHWA and public transportation projects by the FTA. The figure shows that the cumulative obligations of \nfunds for highway projects and public transportation projects have increased each month between March 2009 and \nJuly 2010, and that the total obligations are nearing the amount of funds apportioned for highway projects and \nappropriated for public transportation projects\n\nRecovery Act 73GAO, Recovery Act States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address \nImplementation Challenges and Bolster Accountability, GAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C.

California officials stated that locally- administered highway projects take \nlonger to reach the reimbursement phase because of the additional steps required to approve local highway \nprojects and because localities with relatively small projects tend to seek reimbursement in one lump sum at the \nend of a project to minimize time and administrative costs\n\nThe effect of projects sponsored by local agencies on reimbursements is not limited to California. Among all the 16 \nstates and the District, reimbursement of funds suballocated for metropolitan, regional, and local use lagged behind \nstate projects. Suballocated funds can be administered through local transportation agencies such as city or county \nagencies that can lack familiarity with federal requirements. As we have previously reported, local agencies have \nhad challenges selecting projects that will meet these requirement and suballocated funds have generally taken \nlonger to obligate than nonsuballocated funds.73 Data show this pattern extending to reimbursements as well. New \nJersey and Arizona had the lowest reimbursement rates on suballocated projects, 10 and 18 percent, respectively. \nOur past reports have noted that New Jersey and Arizona were among the slowest states to select projects for \nfunding in suballocated areas\n\nTable 7 shows the total reimbursement rates in the 16 states and the District, as well as the reimbursement rates \nfor state and suballocated projects\n\nRecovery Act Table 7 Reimbursement of Recovery Act Funds as a Percentage of Funds Obligated - Ranked by All \nFunds State All funds Suballocated funds State funds District of Columbia 23 29 20 California 26 25 26 Georgia 27 \n23 29 Ohio 29 35 27 Massachusetts 29 27 30 Florida 31 23 34 Texas 35 32 36 New York 37 37 37 New Jersey 37 \n10 48 Selected states' average 39 33 41 Arizona 42 18 52 U.S. average 44 37 46 Pennsylvania 47 47 47 North \nCarolina 47 42 49 Colorado 52 30 61 Michigan 55 53 56 Illinois 65 41 76 Mississippi 69 61 72 Iowa 77 79 76 \nSource GAO analysis of FHWA data\n\nNote Of the total Recovery Act highway funds available to states, 30 percent is to be directed to suballocated areas \nand 70 percent is available for use in any area of the state.

Recovery Act public transportation funds were used \nprimarily for upgrading transit facilities and improving bus fleets (see fig. 18) Recovery Act 74GAO, Physical \nInfrastructure Challenges and Investment Options for the Nation's Infrastructure, GAO-08-763T (Washington, D.C. \nMay 8, 2008)\n\n\n\nFigure 18 Nationwide Recovery Act Highway and Public Transportation Obligations by Project Type Notes Highway \nand public transportation percentages may not add to 100 because of rounding\n\nPublic transportation obligations include Recovery Act funds that were transferred from FHWA to FTA.

The highway figure shows that the majority of funds \nwere obligated for reconstruction and rehabilitation of pavement (25 percent of highway funds) and pavement \nresurfacing (22 percent). The public transportation figure shows that the majority of funds were used for transit \ninfrastructure construction (51 percent) followed by bus purchases and rehabilitation (24 percent)\n\nRecovery Act facilitate the timely use of funds, including early March 2010 (1- year) deadlines to obligate Recovery \nAct highway and transit funds. In our May 2010 report, we reported that the states met these deadlines\n\nSince the March 2010 deadline for obligating Recovery Act highway funds, states have asked FHWA to deobligate \nsome funds and are subsequently asking FHWA to obligate these funds to new projects. To use states' full \napportionments, those funds must be obligated again by September 30, 2010, after which all unobligated highway \nfunds will no longer be available to the states. As of August 2, 2010, about $397 million, or 2.6 percent, of total \nRecovery Act highway funds remained to be obligated in the 16 states and the District. Nationally, about $565 \nmillion remained. These amounts have increased steadily since the March 2010 deadline-for example, in the 1-\nmonth period between June 30, 2010, and August 2, 2010, the amount available for obligation increased from \nabout $509 million to $565 million (see fig. 19)\n\nFigure 19 Recovery Act Highway Funds Remaining to Be Obligated Since March 2, 2010 This figure shows the \namount of Recovery Act highway funds remaining to be obligated. These funds were deobligated after the March 1, \n2010, obligation deadline by which time states had to request that FHWA obligate their full apportionment. \nSubsequent to the deadline states deobligated funds for reasons such as bid savings, and the figure shows that this \namount increased steadily from March 2010 through August 2010\n\nRecovery Act Projects supported with suballocated funds generally had higher levels of unobligated funds \ncompared with projects using funds that are not suballocated. As of August 2, 2010, $199 million of the $7.7 billion \navailable to suballocated areas nationwide remained to be obligated before the September 30, 2010, deadline. \nAlso, several of the states we reviewed had unobligated suballocated funds that were roughly three to five times \nlarger than the national average (see table 8). FHWA officials told us that the timely expenditure of funds on \nprojects administered by local public agencies remains an area of concern and that the agency is closely monitoring \nthese projects to ensure, on behalf of the states, that all funds are obligated. These funds will be withdrawn after \nSeptember 30, 2010, if these funds are not obligated\n\nTable 8 Percentage of Unobligated Recovery Act Highway Funds State Suballocated funds State funds All funds \nArizona 12.4 5.6 7.6 California 2.0 3.0 2.7 Colorado 0.0 1.6 1.2 District of Columbia 0.0 12.8 8.9 Florida 5.4 3.6 4.2 \nGeorgia 9.0 7.5 7.9 Illinois 1.4 0.6 0.9 Iowa 0.2 0.9 0.7 Massachusetts 3.2 7.3 6.2 Michigan 1.2 0.9 1.0 Mississippi \n1.2 0.0 0.4 New Jersey 1.6 0.4 0.8 New York 0.3 0.5 0.5 North Carolina 8.9 1.8 3.9 Ohio 1.2 4.3 3.4 Pennsylvania \n0.0 0.3 0.2 Texas 0.9 1.5 1.3 Selected states' average 2.8 2.5 2.6 U.S. average 2.6 2.0 2.2 Source GAO analysis of \nFHWA data\n\n\n\nNote Of the total Recovery Act highway funds available to states, 30 percent is to be directed to suballocated areas \nand 70 percent is available for use in any area of the state. Percentages based on obligation of funds by FHWA as \nof August 2, 2010\n\nRecovery Act State officials identified several reasons projects might have been delayed in suballocated areas. \nOfficials from the Arizona Department of Transportation, in which 12.4 percent of suballocated funds were \nunobligated, said that many suballocated areas did not have projects ready for federal-aid funding in part because \nof limited staff and other resources to move projects through approvals and prepare documentation in a manner \nconsistent with federal requirements. Officials from North Carolina, in which 8.9 percent of suballocated funding was \ndeobligated, told us that local agencies using suballocated funding faced challenges completing environmental \ndocuments, acquiring rights-of-way, and finalizing bid documents. As a result, many projects local agencies \nconsidered to be \"ready-to-go\" did not meet various federal standards, and agencies had to find other projects, \nwhich created delays\n\nAmong the states we reviewed, most of the funds that the states asked FHWA to deobligate were from contract \naward savings. From March 2, 2010, to June 7, 2010, the 16 states and the District that we are reviewing requested \nFHWA to deobligate almost $457 million. About 85 percent of those funds were deobligated due to contracts \ncontinuing to be awarded below state cost estimates (see fig. 20)\n\nRecovery Act Figure 20 Deobligations in 16 States and the District from March 2, 2010, to June 7, 2010, by \nDeobligation Type Note \"Other\" includes obligation reductions due to costs that were found not to be eligible for \nfederal- aid reimbursement, revised estimates for projects, and corrections of data errors\n\nWithdrawn projects accounted for only about $17 million, or 4 percent, of deobligations from March 2 to June 7, \n2010, less than 1 percent of the total $15.2 billion available to the 16 states and the District for highways. Two \nprojects using suballocated funds in California accounted for about $9.7 million of the $17 million in withdrawn \nprojects. In both cases, the project was withdrawn and later established as a new project. California officials told us \nthey withdrew one $1.8 million project because local officials wanted to expand the scope of the project. Another \n$7.9 million project was withdrawn because it had an incorrect right-of-way certification Officials told us that the \nstate subsequently resubmitted the project and funding was obligated after correcting the certification\n\nContract Data from FHWA's Recovery Act Data System Continues to Be Inaccurate In May 2010, we reported that \nwhile progress has been made in awarding Recovery Act contracts and initiating work, the accuracy of contract \ndata in FHWA's Recovery Act Data System (RADS) is of concern. Among other This figure presents data on the \npercent of funds deobligated since the March 2010 obligation deadline for various reasons. Specifically, the figure \nshows that 85 percent of funds were deobligated due to continued contract award savings. Other reasons for \ndeobligations included cost under runs (7 percent), withdrawn projects (4 percent), change in the scope of work (2 \npercent), and other reasons (2 percent)\n\nRecovery Act 75Recovery Act, div. A, title XII, 1201(c)\n\n76We reviewed data in RADS as of June 18, 2010, for all 50 states and the District\n\n77DOT Secretary of Transportation, Section 1201(c) One-Year Report, (Washington, D.C. May 7, 2010)\n\ninformation, the Recovery Act requires the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to report to Congress on the \nnumber of projects for which contracts have been awarded, for which work has begun, and for which work had been \ncompleted, and the amount of federal funds associated with these contracts.75 DOT established RADS because it \nhad not previously collected and reported such information for the regular federal highway formula program. DOT \nrelies on states to enter data into RADS and uses automated data checks and rules, as well as periodic reviews by \nFHWA Division office officials located in every state, to improve the accuracy of state-reported data\n\nWe continued to find problems with the accuracy of RADS contract data.76 For example, more than 3,100 contracts \nwere shown as having been awarded on the same date the funds were obligated. We also found that about 1,400 \n\n\n\ncontracts were reported as awarded before FHWA obligated the funds. Because contracts are normally awarded \nseveral weeks or months after funds are obligated by FHWA, the numbers and amounts of contracts awarded and \nwork begun is likely overstated. Because FHWA does not have accurate data from states in RADS, it is not able to \nuse RADS to meet the Recovery Act reporting requirements for contracts\n\nFHWA officials acknowledged that they cannot use data from RADS to provide information on contract award \namounts. Officials said they instead use data from FHWA's financial management system to meet the Recovery \nAct reporting requirements for contracts because this system receives more checks for data accuracy. However, \nusing FHWA's financial management system can also overstate the amount of funds under contract. FHWA \nreports data at the project level, not at the contract level; this is important because one project can include several \ncontracts. When reporting at the project level, FHWA reports the entire project as being under contract once one \ncontract is awarded, even if several more remain to be awarded. FHWA provided project-level data in its report to \nCongress dated May 7, 2010,77 but these data were labeled in the report as contract data. As noted above, the \nRecovery Act requires DOT to report not only the number of projects, but also the total amount of federal funds\n\nRecovery Act 78Generally, FHWA has authority pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 104(k)(1) to transfer funds made available \nfor transit projects to FTA\n\nassociated with contracts that have been awarded, work has begun, and work is completed\n\nFHWA has taken some steps to improve data accuracy in RADS, but officials said that there was no date for when \nthey would implement changes. These officials said they have assembled a state advisory group to look at the \nchallenges that exist in RADS and make recommendations on improvements. FHWA officials said they have not \nhad sufficient resources to incorporate additional data checks into the software that would check for errors. Such \nchecks could ensure that milestones are sequentially entered, thereby improving the accuracy of these data\n\nMany States Requested That FHWA Transfer Funds to FTA for Public Transportation Projects and Many States \nand Transit Agencies Elected to Use Some Funds for Operating Expenses, Although Data on Operating Expenses \nIs Limited As we reported in our prior Recovery Act work, states have the option to request that FHWA transfer \nRecovery Act highway funds to FTA for use in public transportation programs, just as they do in the regular Federal \nAid Highway Program.78 While most states transfer some funds each year to address transit priorities, data from \nRecovery Act funds indicated that 21 states requested FHWA transfer some Recovery Act funds to the states' \npublic transportation program. Many states transferred funds shortly after Recovery Act funds became available in \nFebruary 2009. For example, Caltrans transferred almost $2 million in July 2009. Caltrans officials told us that their \nstate has a robust transfer program because of the state's extensive public transportation system and the system's \nmany needs\n\nCaltrans' subrecipients used this funding for two large projects identified in the state's transportation improvement \nplan but for which sufficient funding had not been available. Specifically, one subrecipient is purchasing two buses \nfor a rural transit agency, and the second is constructing a new intermodal transit hub that will serve the north Lake \nTahoe area. Caltrans officials said that the Recovery Act funding was sufficient to complete these programs\n\nRecovery Act 79Located in Urbanized Areas; these areas may cross state lines\n\n80Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-32, 1202 (June 24, 2009)\n\nAccording to FTA data, many state departments of transportation (DOT) and transit agencies79 also used a portion \nof Recovery Act funds for public transportation operating expenses. In June 2009, Congress gave urbanized areas \nand states the authority to use a maximum of up to 10 percent of certain Recovery Act transit funds for operating \nexpenses.80 Data provided by FTA indicated that, nationwide, urbanized areas and states used about $190 million, \nor about 2 percent of Recovery Act funding for public transportation, toward operating expenses as of August 25, \n2010. FTA officials told us that urbanized areas and states determine how much Recovery Act funds they spend on \noperating expenses. According to FTA data, 169 grantees throughout the U.S. chose to use a portion of public \ntransportation funds for operating expenses. This represented approximately 25 percent of total Recovery Act \n\n\n\npublic transportation grantees. These 169 grantees ranged from major urban transit agencies in San Francisco and \nSt. Louis to transit agencies in smaller cities such as Charlottesville, Virginia, and Pocatello, Idaho. In addition, 18 \nstates used a portion of their Recovery Act funding to pay for operating expenses for rural public transportation\n\nFTA provided us data on the dollar amounts that urbanized areas and states obligated for operating expenses, but \nnoted that they did not begin to track at a national level the percent of funds each state or urbanized area was using \nfor operating expenses until August 2010. FTA officials also said that they rely on FTA's regional offices-as part of \nthe grant approval and review process-to ensure that urbanized areas and states plan to spend no more than the \n10 percent threshold. However, they are considering instituting a control in its electronic grants management \nsystem so that staff could not award a grant if an urbanized area or state was over the 10 percent threshold. FTA \nofficials also noted that there is no reporting requirement to make publicly available the percent of funds that \nurbanized areas and states are using for operating expenses but that they are considering placing summary \ninformation on the use of Recovery Act transit funds for operating expenses on the FTA Web site\n\nWe spoke with several states and transit agencies about whether they used Recovery Act funds for operating \nexpenses. For example, officials from Michigan's Department of Transportation, after asking nonurban transit \nagencies for input, found that funding for operating expenses was a\n\nRecovery Act 81Caltrans' paratransit program is a curb-to-curb shared ride service for the disabled who are unable \nto use fixed bus or rail routes\n\npriority. According to Michigan Department of Transportation officials, the majority of nonurban transit systems in \nMichigan are demand response-meaning that passengers are picked up and dropped off where they want to go \nwithin a defined service area-and officials told us that expenses for these services have been increasing annually. \nAs a result, officials said the state used the maximum 10 percent of Recovery Act transit funds for this purpose\n\nOfficials from Caltrans told us that they used 1.1 percent of their Recovery Act funds for the operating expenses of \ntheir paratransit program.81 They added that these expenses were already allowable as capital expenses under \nboth the Recovery Act as originally enacted and the regular federal transit programs. Caltrans officials told us that if \nthey had the option to use transit funds for public transportation operating expenses when the Recovery Act was \nfirst enacted, they would have used the full 10 percent\n\nHowever, because California had already identified and requested that funds be obligated for capital projects prior \nto when the option to use these funds for operating expenses became available, they chose to adhere to their initial \nplan rather than risk that the funds be deobligated and applied for another purpose\n\nTransit officials from Illinois and New Jersey said their states chose not to use Recovery Act funds for operating \nexpenses. Illinois DOT officials told us they decided early in the process to devote all Recovery Act funds to capital \nprojects, so that the use of these funds was evident to the public\n\nIllinois also chose to use state funds to cover all administrative expenses related to managing Recovery Act funds \nboth to ensure maximum impact on capital projects and minimize paperwork needed to clear administrative charges \nfor payments. New Jersey Transit officials told us they used Recovery Act funds for preventive maintenance-such \nas bus mechanical maintenance-which they said was considered a capital expense but did not produce new \ninfrastructure. Officials noted that this reduced pressure on the transit agency's budget, which freed up state funds \nfor operating expenses\n\nAs we reported in May 2010, a portion of the highway money that was transferred was not obligated by the \nRecovery Act's March 2010 1- year obligation deadline for highways and transit. We noted that the U.S\n\nRecovery Act 82GAO, Recovery Act States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address \nImplementation Challenges and Bolster Accountability, GAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C. May 26, 2010), 35\n\n\n\n83As DOT pointed out, section 104(k) requires that funds transferred under that authority are to be administered in \naccordance with the provisions of chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, which does not include a withdrawal \nand redistribution procedure. 23 U.S.C. 104(k)(1); 49 U.S.C. 5334(i)(1). When specific and general statutes appear \nto conflict and a general provision is \"broad enough to include the subject to which the specific provision relates, the \nspecific provision should be regarded as an exception to the general provision so that both may be given effect, the \ngeneral applying only where the specific provision is inapplicable.\" B-255979, Oct. 30, 1995, quoting B-163375, \nSept. 2, 1971. Section 104(k) specifically prescribes the disposition of funds transferred under authority of the \nsection- namely, that funds transferred under section 104(k) are to be administered under chapter 53 of title 49. As \nsuch, the Recovery Act's 1-year obligation deadline for FHWA's Highway Infrastructure Investment appropriation \ndoes not apply\n\nFurthermore, because the transferred funds were not originally appropriated to FTA's Transit Capital Assistance or \nFixed Guideway Infrastructure Investment Programs, and they were not merged with those funds upon transfer to \nFTA, they are not subject to FTA's distribution formula for transit capital assistance and fixed guideway \ninfrastructure and, therefore, are not subject to the 1-year obligation deadline applicable to FTA's Recovery Act \nappropriations. Instead, the funds were transferred after identification of specific ready-to-work projects\n\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) did not treat these funds as subject to the Recovery Act obligation deadline for \neither FHWA or FTA because it concluded that once Recovery Act highway funds were transferred to FTA, they \nwere subject to the provisions of the law that apply generally to the transfer of highway funds to FTA. At the time, \nwe expressed no opinion on DOT's determination but stated that we were exploring this issue further.82 On further \nreview, we have no objection to DOT's interpretation of the applicability of the Recovery Act's 1-year obligation \ndeadlines.83 Impact of Transportation Funds Obligation and Reimbursement of Regular FHWA Formula Funds \nSlowed during the Recovery Act, Raising Questions about Whether Recovery Act Funds Had the Full Economic \nStimulative Effect Intended While states have been working to have FHWA obligate funds for constructing Recovery \nAct projects, we found that, compared with previous years, many states were slower in obligating and expending \nregular federal highway formula funds. FHWA officials stated that with the emphasis placed on the economic \nbenefits to be gained, the obligation of Recovery Act funds and meeting the act's statutory deadlines have taken \npriority. States are facing drastic fiscal conditions, and FHWA officials\n\nRecovery Act 84The average of funds remaining to be obligated on June 30 for federal fiscal years 2007, 2008, and \n2009 was $12.1 billion\n\nnoted economic and budget difficulties in many states have led to staffing shortages. FHWA officials also suggested \nthat uncertainty about future program funding levels may have slowed spending because a long-term \nreauthorization of federal programs has not yet been enacted\n\nNationally, as of June 30, 2010 (the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year), states had $19.7 billion remaining to \nbe obligated, 63 percent more funds than they did at the same time for the 3 previous years84 (see fig. 21)\n\nFigure 21 Regular Federal Highway Formula Funds Nationwide Remaining to Be Obligated at the End of the Third \nQuarter of Fiscal Year 2010 In addition, while funding available to states for highways has increased in each of the \nlast 3 fiscal years, we found that as of July 31, 2010, the reimbursement of regular federal highway formula program \nfunds were lower compared with the reimbursement at the same point in the 3 previous fiscal years (see fig. 22)\n\nFunds remaining to be obligated0500010,00015,00020,00025,000 2010200920082007Dollars (in millions) Source \nGAO analysis of FHWA data\n\nFiscal year\n\nRecovery Act Figure 22 Regular Federal Aid Highway Funds Reimbursed Nationwide at End of the Third Quarter \nfor Fiscal Years 2007 through 2010 As Figure 23 shows, this trend was also true on a monthly average basis\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the reimbursement of regular federal highway formula funds for the first 10 months of fiscal year 2010 \nhas been almost 18 percent (or about $4.3 billion) less than the average reimbursement in the previous 3 fiscal \nyears\n\nFunds reimbursed05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000 2010200920082007Dollars (in millions) Source GAO \nanalysis of FHWA data\n\nFiscal year\n\nRecovery Act Figure 23 Nationwide Monthly Reimbursement of Federal Highway Formula Funds for Fiscal Year \n2010 and the Average for Fiscal Years 2007-009 In the last 3 months of fiscal year 2010, state highway agencies \nnot only have to request FHWA obligate over $500 million in remaining Recovery Act funds, but also $19.7 billion of \nregular federal highway formula funds\n\nThe amount of unobligated regular federal highway formula funds varied among states. For example, Illinois had \nnone as of June 30, 2010, while Utah had $178.4 million-almost 6 times as much compared with its average \nbalance of unobligated funds over the 3 previous years\n\nNationally, we found 16 states with over twice the amount of unobligated funds, while 5 states had fewer \nunobligated funds than in the past. Some state officials told us they had not been obligating regular federal highway \nformula funds as quickly because they had been focusing on meeting the This figure shows the nationwide monthly \nreimbursement of federal-aid highway funds for fiscal year 2010 and the monthly average for fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2009. The amount reimbursed for each month in fiscal year 2010 is lower than the monthly average \nreimbursements for the three previous years\n\nRecovery Act 85For this report, GAO interviewed officials in California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, \nNorth Carolina, and Texas regarding expenditures of their regular federal-aid highway program funds\n\n86The Highway Infrastructure Investment, Transit Capital Assistance and the Fixed Guideway Infrastructure \nInvestment Programs are formula grant programs, which apportion funds to states or their subdivisions by law. \nApportioned funds are obligated when DOT issues project or grant agreements to recipients, a process that is \ntypically followed by contractor selection, contract award, and performance. As expenses are incurred, recipients \nmay request and be reimbursed for their expenses following program eligibility guidelines\n\nRecovery Act obligation deadlines and did not have the resources to do both.85 Because states did not spend \nregular federal highway formula funds at the same pace as in previous years, while also spending Recovery Act \nfunds, the full economic benefits of Recovery Act funds are likely to be delayed\n\nSpecifically, if states had awarded contracts and begun expending those regular federal highway formula funds at \nthe same rate as in previous years and in conjunction with spending Recovery Act funds, states would have \nexperienced an earlier stimulus effect.86 Funding being obligated now for projects will need up to several months to \naward contracts and initiate construction, and the effect on the economy comes when construction is initiated and \nworkers are employed\n\nFHWA officials said they expect all regular program funds to be obligated by the end of the fiscal year. To ensure \nthat all authorized funds are obligated nationally each year, FHWA redistributes obligation authority from states that \nare not able to obligate their funds to other states that are\n\nDespite projects being obligated at a slower rate than in previous years, in August 2010, when we completed our \nreview, the 16 states and the District all reported to FHWA that they would fully obligate fiscal year 2010 highway \nformula funds. We will continue to monitor the relationship of obligations and reimbursements in both the regular \nfederal highway formula program and Recovery Act in future reviews\n\n\n\nDOT Is Developing Plans to Assess the Impact of the Recovery Act but Has Not Committed to Assessing Long-\nTerm Benefits The goals of the Recovery Act were not only to promote economic recovery and to preserve and \ncreate jobs but also to make investments in transportation and other infrastructure that would provide long-term\n\nRecovery Act 87GAO, Executive Guide Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act, \nGAO/GGD-96-118 (Washington, D.C. June 1996)\n\neconomic benefits. However, the Recovery Act did not include requirements that DOT or states measure the impact \nof funding on highway and transit projects to assess whether these projects ultimately produced long-term benefits. \nIn our May 2010 report, we noted that, although DOT developed performance plans to measure the impact of \nRecovery Act transportation programs, these plans generally did not contain an extensive discussion of specific \ngoals and measures needed to assess the impact of Recovery Act projects. As we have reported, it is important for \norganizations to measure performance to understand the progress they are making toward their goals.87 In our \nMay 2010 report, we noted several efforts DOT initiated to strengthen its capacity to assess the impact of Recovery \nAct funds. For example, DOT is exploring opportunities to link databases that stored information about road \nsmoothness and congestion, bridge structural sufficiency, and transit performance with financial data\n\nOur May report recommended that DOT assess the results of Recovery Act transportation investments and \ndetermine whether these investments produced long-term benefits. We further recommended that, in the near term, \nDOT determine the types of data and performance measures needed to conduct such an assessment and, as \nappropriate, identify specific authority DOT may need to collect and report on these measures. In its response, \nDOT noted that it expected to be able to report on Recovery Act outputs, such as the miles of road paved, bridges \nrepaired, and transit vehicles purchased, but not on outcomes, such as reductions in travel time, nor did it commit to \nassessing whether transportation investments produced long-term benefits. DOT further explained that limitations in \nits data systems, coupled with the magnitude of Recovery Act funds relative to the overall annual federal investment \nin transportation, would make assessing the benefits of Recovery Act funds difficult. DOT indicated that, with these \nlimitations in mind, it is examining its existing data availability and, as necessary, would seek additional data \ncollection authority from Congress if it became apparent that such authority were needed. While we are encouraged \nthat DOT plans to take some steps to assess its data needs, it has not committed to assessing the long-term \nbenefits of Recovery Act investments in transportation infrastructure. We are therefore keeping our \nrecommendation on this matter open\n\nRecovery Act 88Recovery Act, div. A, title XII, 1201(a). A state that does not meet its level of effort will be prohibited \nfrom participating in the redistribution of federal-aid highway obligation authority, scheduled to occur in August 2011\n\n89DOT officials indicated that Massachusetts and Minnesota agreed to correct errors in the amount identified for \nthe states' transit programs, and the states agreed to provide this information to DOT by early September 2010. \nDOT was in discussion with Connecticut to determine whether there were errors to correct in the certification, and \nofficials said this issue would also be resolved by early September\n\nDOT Plans to Report on State Progress in Meeting Maintenance-of- Effort Provisions As we have previously \nreported, timely information on the progress states are making in meeting the Recovery Act maintenance-of-effort \nprovisions could better inform policymakers' decisions on the usefulness and effectiveness of the maintenance-of- \neffort requirements and of including similar provisions in future legislation. The Recovery Act required governors to \ncertify that their states will maintain the level of spending for the types of transportation projects funded by the \nRecovery Act that it planned to spend the day the Recovery Act was enacted. As part of this certification, the \ngovernor of each state was required to identify the amount of state funds planned to be spent from February 17, \n2009, through September 30, 2010.88 Timely information is also important to assessing the impact of Recovery Act \nfunding and whether it achieves its intended effects of providing countercyclical assistance and increasing overall \nspending\n\nOur earlier reports have noted that DOT does not have current information on the progress states are making \ntoward meeting their certified amounts\n\n\n\nThis is because the Recovery Act does not require states to report final expenditures until February 2011. As a \nresult, DOT will not make a determination as to whether states have met their required program expenditures until \nsome 6 months after the maintenance-of- effort provision time period expires on September 30, 2010. We have also \nreported that the challenges to implementing a maintenance-of- effort provision have been tremendous-as of mid-\nAugust 2010, for example, DOT had not yet fully accepted the certifications of three states.89 As we have \nreported, these implementation challenges, coupled with the fiscal challenges states have faced, raise questions \nas to whether the maintenance-of-effort provision will achieve its intended purpose of preventing states from \nsubstituting federal funds for some of their planned spending on transportation programs. That said, DOT and \nFHWA have\n\nRecovery Act 90GAO, Recovery Act One Year Later, States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Opportunities to \nStrengthen Accountability, GAO-10-437 (Washington, D.C. Mar. 3, 2010)\n\ninvested a significant amount of time and work to ensure consistency across states on how compliance with the act \nis certified and reported. As a result, DOT is in an advantageous position to understand lessons learned-what \nworked, what did not, and what could be improved in the future\n\nOur March 2010 report recommended that DOT gather timely information on the progress states are making in \nmeeting the maintenance-of-effort requirements.90 Specifically, we recommended that DOT gather these data and \nreport preliminary information to Congress within 60 days of the maintenance-of-effort period on (1) whether states \nmet required program expenditures as outlined in their maintenance-of-effort certifications; (2) the reasons that \nstates did not meet these certified levels, if applicable; and (3) lessons learned from the process. In response, DOT \nofficials stated that DOT will encourage states to report preliminary data for the certified period ending September \n30, 2010, and deliver a preliminary report to Congress within 60 days of the certified period. DOT officials said they \nhave developed a timeline for obtaining information to produce this report and will issue guidance by October 1, \n2010, requesting that states update actual aggregate expenditure data and provide the data to DOT by November \n15, 2010. DOT officials said they will use this information to develop the report to Congress, and it will submit the \nreport no later than November 30, 2010\n\nPublicly Available Information Continues to Overstate the Extent to Which Recovery Act Funds Were Directed to \nEconomically Distressed Areas Our previous reports have identified challenges DOT faced in implementing the \nRecovery Act requirement that states give priority to\n\nRecovery Act 91Specifically, the Recovery Act requires states to give priority to projects that can be completed \nwithin 3 years and to projects located in economically distressed areas\n\nEconomically distressed areas are defined by the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as \namended. To qualify as an economically distressed area, an area must (1) have a per capita income of 80 percent \nor less of the national average; (2) have an unemployment rate that is, for the most recent 24-month period for \nwhich data are available, at least 1 percent greater than the national average unemployment rate; or (3) be an area \nthat the Secretary of Commerce determines has experienced or is about to experience a \"special need\" arising from \nactual or threatened severe unemployment or economic adjustment problems resulting from severe short- or long- \nterm changes in economic conditions\n\n92Each state used FHWA's special-need criterion that relates to severe job dislocation resulting from actual or \nthreatened business closure or restructuring. These states were advised that in order to be consistent with the \nFHWA guidance, the states must have data that show a connection between demonstrated severe job losses and \nactual, identified firm closures and restructurings\n\ncompleted within the 3-year time frame over other projects. In addition, projects located in economically distressed \nareas.91 In July 2009, we reported substantial variation in the extent to which states prioritized projects in \neconomically distressed areas and how they identified these areas. Many states based their project selections on \nother factors and only later identified whether these projects were in economically distressed areas. We also found \ninstances of states developing their own eligibility requirements for economically distressed areas using data or \n\n\n\ncriteria not specified in the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended. In response to our \nrecommendation, FHWA, in consultation with the Department of Commerce, issued guidance to the states in \nAugust 2009 that defined \"priority,\" and directed states to give priority to projects that were located in an \neconomically distressed area and could be FHWA's guidance set out criteria for states to use to identify \neconomically distressed areas based on \"special need.\" Three states-Arizona, California, and Illinois-developed \ntheir own eligibility requirements or applied a special-need criterion that overstated the number of counties, and \nthus the amount of funds, directed to economically distressed areas. For example, California designated all \ncounties as economically distressed, and we identified 219 projects with an estimated cost of $1.1 billion coded as \nbeing in economically distressed areas that should not have been so coded. In early February 2010, FHWA \ndetermined the documentation these states provided to justify these additional designations was not consistent with \nFHWA guidance.92 In May 2010, we recommended that FHWA advise these states to correct the designations, and \nin July 2010, FHWA instructed its division offices to\n\nRecovery Act advise the states to revise their designations and to report these projects as being in \nnoneconomically distressed areas\n\nIn December 2009, DOT testified to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that 57 percent of \nprojects were in economically distressed areas-including 99 percent and 100 percent of Recovery Act highway \nfunding in California and Arizona, respectively\n\nHowever, as we noted above, these data had not yet been corrected by DOT and therefore overstated the amount \nof funding, and this testimony is DOT's only public accounting of how states implemented this provision of the \nRecovery Act. Because FHWA's July guidance did not direct states other than Arizona, California, and Illinois to \ncorrect existing entries, we reviewed RADS data on projects in economically distressed areas. We found about \n2,300 projects that did not appear to meet FHWA's guidance for classifying projects in economically distressed \nareas and thus appeared to contain errors that would result in an overstating of the funds directed to these areas. \nFor instance, over 2,100 of these entries did not include an explanation justifying the designation of an area as \neconomically distressed. In response to this information, DOT officials told us that they manually compared these \nentries with maps designating distressed area and other data sources. When we completed our review, FHWA \nofficials said they were able to verify that most of these data were accurate; however, they did not provide \ndocumentation of the analysis to us. DOT stated it does not intend to correct this information because the Recovery \nAct does not contain a specific requirement that DOT report on the extent to which distressed areas prioritized and \ndirected funds to economically distressed areas. However, without accurate publicly available information, it is \ndifficult to determine the extent to which Recovery Act funds were directed to areas most severely impacted by the \nrecession or to know the extent to which states prioritized these areas in selecting projects for funding\n\nAlthough Recovery Act Provisions Do Not All Contain Reporting Requirements, Additional Reporting Would Help \nDecision Makers and the Public Better Understand If Its Goals Were Met The Recovery Act included a number of \nrequirements and provisions designed to support the Act's goals of promoting economic recovery, creating jobs, \nand, in the case of transportation funds, making investments that contribute to long-term economic benefits. \nAlthough the Act included some reporting requirements to accompany these provisions, it did not specify such \nrequirements in all cases. Noting the large amount of federal transportation funding provided in the Recovery Act, \nwe have previously made recommendations that DOT take additional steps to go beyond the specific reporting \nrequirements in the Act, and that DOT develop plans to assess the long-term benefits of Recovery Act funds on the \ntransportation system. We have also made recommendations that DOT improve and\n\nRecovery Act 93The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 was signed into law on December 19, \n2007. Pub.L. No. 110-140, 121 Stat. 1667\n\ncorrect the data it is collecting to better facilitate a public accounting of the use and impact of these funds. For \ninstance, we have recommended that DOT report on the extent to which states met maintenance-of-effort \nrequirements 60 days after the end of the certification period\n\n\n\nIn his March 2009 memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies, the President emphasized \nthe need for providing public transparency and accountability of these expenditures. We are making two new \nrecommendations to DOT because of the value such information can offer policy decision makers and the public to \nbetter understand whether the use of Recovery Act funds met intended goals. We plan to continue to monitor these \nissues in our future work\n\nRecommendations To ensure that Congress and the public have accurate information on the extent to which the \ngoals of the Recovery Act are being met, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation direct FHWA to take \nthe following two actions - Develop additional rules and data checks in the Recovery Act Data System, so that these \ndata will accurately identify contract milestones such as award dates and amounts, and provide guidance to states \nto revise existing contract data\n\n- Make publicly available-within 60 days after the September 30, 2010, obligation deadline-an accurate accounting \nand analysis of the extent to which states directed funds to economically distressed areas, including corrections to \nthe data initially provided to Congress in December 2009\n\nDOE and Grant Recipients Are Working to Overcome Challenges in Spending, Monitoring, and Reporting \nOutcomes for New EECBG Program The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program (EECBG) is \nadministered by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within the Department of Energy (DOE). It \nwas authorized in the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 200793 and funded for the first time by the \nRecovery Act. The EECBG program provides about $3.2 billion in grants to develop, promote, implement, and \nmanage projects to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use and fossil fuel emissions in local \ncommunities. Of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion has been allocated through formula grants to about 2,150 \nstate, local, and tribal\n\nRecovery Act 94While about 2,350 recipients were authorized to receive EECBG formula funding, only about 2,150 \nEECBG formula grants were awarded to recipients. This is because about 100 Native American tribes consolidated \ntheir funds and were awarded EECBG funds as one group and because, as of July 1, 2010, 64 potential recipients \n(amounting to about $6.4 million) returned funds or didn't apply for grant funds. The remaining 36 recipients have \nnot yet been allocated grant funds by DOE\n\n95Approximately 2 percent of the formula funding is for competitive grants to cities, counties, and tribes not eligible \nfor direct formula funding\n\ngovernments (recipients) as of August 23, 2010.94 Funding is allocated to state recipients based on their population \nand total energy consumption; to city and county recipients based on their resident and commuter populations; and \nto Native American tribes based on population and climatic conditions. Eligible applicants for formula EECBG \ngrants include the 50 states; the District of Columbia (the District); five U.S. territories; cities or city equivalents, \nsuch as towns or villages with populations of at least 35,000; counties with populations of at least 200,000; and \nfederally recognized Native American tribes. Each state-level recipient must use at least 60 percent of its allocation \nto provide subgrants to local government units that are not eligible for direct formula grants. In addition to these \nformula grants, the Recovery Act also includes approximately $400 million in EECBG funding to be awarded on a \ncompetitive basis. Competitive grants are designed to stimulate activities that can fundamentally and permanently \ntransform energy markets and sustain themselves beyond the grant period. Our review focuses on the direct \nformula grants\n\nDOE Has Obligated Most Funds to Grant Recipients, Who Have Obligated about Half to Subrecipients; Overall \nSpending Rates Are at 11 Percent The Recovery Act requires that DOE obligate $2.8 billion in formula EECBG \nfunds by September 30, 2010. DOE has obligated most of the EECBG funds to recipients and has plans to obligate \nthe remainder by the September 30 deadline. As of September 13, 2010, DOE has obligated to recipients more \nthan 99 percent of this amount-$2.77 billion. Nearly all of the approximately 2,150 recipients nationwide- \napproximately 1,700 cities and counties, 56 states and territories, and 392 tribal communities-have received \nEECBG funding, with about 68 percent (approximately $1.9 billion) going to cities and counties, 28 percent \n\n\n\n(approximately $767 million) to states, territories, and the District, and 2 percent (approximately $55 million) to \nNative American tribes.95 Steps are being taken to ensure that the remaining funds will be obligated to recipients \nby the September 30 deadline, and the DOE Inspector General has recently\n\nRecovery Act 96DOE, Special Report Review of the Department of Energy's Plan for Obligating Remaining \nRecovery Act Contract and Grant Funding, OAS-RA- 10-15 (Aug. 4, 2010)\n\n97GAO defines larger grant amounts as amounts greater than $2 million\n\nreported96 that there is nothing to indicate that DOE's plan to obligate the remaining Recovery Act funding by \nSeptember 30 will not be effective\n\nDOE announced the opportunity for interested applicants to submit applications for EECBG formula funding on \nMarch 26, 2009. As part of the application process, interested states and local units of government were required to \nsubmit an Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (EECS) that described their strategy for achieving the goals \nof the program. DOE reviewed recipients' EECS and had 120 days to approve or disapprove EECS strategies. DOE \nofficials report that as of July 2010, most recipients have had their EECS plans approved and are now moving from \nthe application to the execution phase. Also, as of July 2010, DOE officials report that EECBG grant recipients \nhave obligated to subrecipients about half ($1.3 billion) of the $2.8 billion awarded to recipients through formula \ngrants. While most recipients are moving to implement projects, recipients awarded larger grant amounts have \nobligated about twice as much as recipients awarded smaller grant amounts.97 As of July 2010, the 291 recipients \nreceiving EECBG grants above $2 million have obligated to subrecipients about half (approximately $1.1 billion) of \nthe $1.9 billion awarded to them by DOE through formula grants. The remaining 1,860 or so smaller communities \n(communities with grants less than $2 million) have obligated only about one-quarter of their EECBG awards \n(approximately $0.2 billion) of the approximately $0.9 billion awarded to them by DOE through formula grants. To \nfacilitate increased obligations, DOE has encouraged recipients to meet targets of obligating 90 percent or more of \ntheir funds by June 25, 2010\n\nRegarding spending, DOE reports that as of August 2010, about 18 months since the passage of the Recovery \nAct, recipients have spent about 11 percent (approximately $311 million) of the $2.8 billion authorized for formula \nfunding for the program. Consistent with this, many recipients we visited had spent less than 8 percent of the \namount awarded. While many recipients have spent only a small part of their funding, DOE is taking steps to \naccelerate spending. For example, DOE has encouraged recipients to meet a spending target of 20 percent by \nSeptember 30, 2010. DOE officials believe this has had a positive impact on spending rates. In particular, DOE \nofficials note that many recipients receiving less than\n\nRecovery Act 98To retrofit is to install new or modified parts or equipment not available or considered necessary at \nthe time of manufacture in something previously manufactured or constructed or to adapt to a new purpose or need\n\n$250,000 met DOE's target of spending 20 percent as of June 30, 2010-3 months ahead of schedule. DOE officials \nalso note that while spending rates are at 11 percent, much more of the funding is obligated and projects are in the \nprocess of being selected and started. They note that the actual costing of the funds for projects is one of the last \nsteps in the process\n\nEECBG Funds Are to Be Used for a Variety of Energy- Efficient Projects; the Majority of Funds Are Slated for \nEnergy- Efficiency Retrofits, Financial Incentive Programs, and Revolving Loan Funds DOE placed restrictions on \nthe selection of projects in line with EISA and the activities that funds are to be used for. DOE required that projects \nbe selected from the 14 eligible activities identified in EISA. As of July 28, 2010, as shown in table 9, more than 60 \npercent of EECBG funds have been obligated for three purposes energy-efficiency retrofits (35.3 percent), such as \nreplacement of heating and cooling systems in fire stations and libraries in the District;98 financial incentive \nprograms, such as the rebate program in New Jersey that pays for energy-efficiency retrofits not already covered by \nexisting incentives (15.6 percent); and building and facilities (11.1 percent), such as a geothermal system at a new \ncorrections facility. In many of the communities we visited, energy- efficiency improvements were made to public \nbuildings, but the types of projects selected for implementation in public buildings and facilities varied considerably. \n\n\n\nFor example, projects included improvements to a waste treatment plant, occupancy sensor lighting at public \nschools, solar trash compactors to reduce the frequency of trash pickup, solar parking meters, and replacement of \npersonal computer workstations with more energy- efficient virtual desktops that reduce both power consumption \nand environmental waste\n\nRecovery Act 99In addition, local recipients may use up to 20 percent of their funds, or $250,000, whichever is \ngreater, to establish a Revolving Loan Fund\n\nTable 9 EECBG Activity Budgets as of July 28, 2010 Activity Proposed budget Percentage oftotal grant allocation \nEnergy-efficiency and conservation strategy $171,912,214 6.1 Technical consultant services 65,885,751 2.4 \nResidential and commercial buildings and audits 63,927,754 2.3 Financial incentive program 424,609,187 15.2 \nEnergy-efficiency retrofits 958,917,290 34.2 Buildings and facilities 300,729,561 10.7 Transportation 105,925,582 \n3.8 Codes and inspections 19,292,035 0.7 Energy distribution 40,516,778 1.4 Material conservation program \n30,114,903 1.1 Reduction/capture of methane/greenhouse gases 27,091,837 1.0 Lighting 168,743,145 6.0 On-site \nrenewable technology 156,970,165 5.6 Other 157,000,296 5.6 Additional funds yet to be categorized by recipients \n22,343,300 0.8 Competitive grant and administrative costs 86,020,202 3.1 Total grant allocation $2,800,000,000 \n100a Source GAO analysis of DOE data\n\naPercentages may not add due to rounding\n\nWhile not required, grant recipients were also encouraged to implement programs and projects that leveraged other \npublic or private resources, enhanced workforce development, persisted beyond the funding period, and promoted \nenergy market transformation, such as revolving loans and energy savings performance contracting.99 Recipients \nthat we visited indicated that their selection of projects was also based on a variety of additional criteria, including \ncommunities' determination of energy savings; job creation; availability of staff and other resources; the extent to \nwhich communities could benefit after Recovery Act funds run out; the ease with which projects could be easily \nimplemented; the potential for return on savings; and populations to be served. For example, the District chose to \nfocus on target populations that they had been unable to serve,\n\nRecovery Act 100DOE, Funding Opportunity Announcement DE-FOA-0000013 for the Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Block Grant Program - Formula Grants (Mar. 26, 2009)\n\nAlso in DOE, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program Notice 10-011 (Apr. 21, 2010)\n\nsuch as nonprofits and small businesses. Kent County, Michigan also considered the availability of county staff to \ncomplete the project. Several recipients have selected projects that leverage other state energy efficiency \nprograms. For example, in Arizona, EECBG funds were used to take advantage of a program that encourages \ncommercial and government customers to implement energy efficiency projects for which a public utility will pay up \nto 30 percent of the cost. In addition, a few of the recipients we visited had developed a revolving loan fund to \nprovide low- interest loans for energy-efficient improvements in businesses and commercial buildings and facilities\n\nUnclear Guidance Has Hampered Project Implementation; DOE Is Taking Steps to Provide Greater Assistance \nWhile many recipients we visited reported that technical assistance, especially that provided by DOE project \nofficers, was helpful, timely, and sufficient, some recipients and DOE project officers we interviewed reported that \nproject implementation guidance, especially early in the process, was unclear and overwhelming and that such \nguidance has contributed to the delay of project implementation. In particular, several recipients we visited indicated \nthat DOE guidance regarding timeline requirements, drawing down funds, and Buy American requirements was at \ntimes unclear, duplicative, and ever-changing. DOE is working to provide greater assistance to recipients that DOE \nofficials believe will increase responsiveness and clarify guidance. In particular, DOE is adding staff in order to \nreduce the workload of project officers and monitors to give them more time to assist recipients. DOE also recently \nissued guidance that reduces reporting requirements, reduces workloads, and streamlines communication with \nrecipients\n\n\n\nRegarding timeline requirements, grant recipients reported that DOE's guidance on the timeline for obligating, \nspending, and drawing down EECBG funds has been confusing. For example, DOE's Funding Opportunity \nAnnouncement, as well as its Program Notice 10-011 for the EECBG program, states that EECBG recipients are to \nobligate all funds within 18 months of the effective date of their award and expend all funds within 36 months of the \neffective date of their award.100 Most recipients had been awarded funding in the fall of 2009, and several of the \nrecipients we visited believed they were on track to obligate funds within 18 months\n\nRecovery Act 101DOE defines the effective date of the award as the date that the DOE contracting officer signed \nthe award document\n\n102Drawing down is the process in which recipients request and receive authorized federal funds for projects under \nthe terms of the grant\n\nHowever, in April 2010, DOE set internal milestones designed to help recipients ensure that they are on track to \nmeeting their obligation and expenditure deadlines. Specifically, DOE requested that recipients have 90 percent of \ntheir funds under contract and obligated by June 25, 2010, and to spend a minimum of 20 percent of their funds by \nSeptember 30, 2010. While DOE reports that some recipients found the guidance useful and that the new \nguidance was helpful in getting many recipients to obligate funds quickly, several recipients we visited said they \nwere confused by this new guidance. These recipients expressed concern that because of the milestones, they had \nto obligate funds sooner than expected-instead of having 18 months to obligate funds, they had to have funds \nobligated in half the time-approximately 9 months after funds had been awarded. In addition, National Association \nof State Energy Officials (NASEO) representatives said that DOE had not made clear to recipients that the revised \ntimelines were \"milestones\" and not deadlines and that several recipients had the impression that funds could be \ntaken away if recipients did not meet the revised spending targets\n\nof the effective date of their award (by the spring of 2011).101 Regarding requirements on drawing down funds, \nwhile DOE reports that many recipients found information on drawing down funds helpful, a few recipients we \nvisited were confused about when they needed to draw down funds to their accounts.102 These recipients believed \nthat based on DOE guidance, they should draw down their entire award soon after it was awarded. For example, \nColorado Springs, Colorado, officials reported that they drew down the entire $3.7 million award as of March 2010 \nbased on their understanding of the Funding Opportunity Announcement, even though they were not yet ready to \nspend it. In April, a Colorado Springs official realized the mistake, and the city paid back $3.1 million in mid-May \n2010. However, in Jackson County, Michigan, local officials also mistakenly drew down their award and told us that \nwhen they tried to return the money, DOE required them to make interest payments on the amount. DOE issued \nguidance on June 23, 2010, in response to recipient questions on drawing down funds\n\nRecovery Act 103In a June 25, 2010 notice, DOE indicated that it expected to get a list from the National Electrical \nManufacturers Association of domestic producers that can meet the Buy American criteria; however, as of August \n16, 2010, this information was not yet available\n\nRegarding Buy American requirements, recipients report that guidance on the Buy American requirement was \ndifficult to understand and ever- changing. The Buy American requirement of the act generally requires that grant \nrecipients use iron, steel, and manufactured goods produced in the United States on all Recovery Act-funded \nprojects. However, some recipients found that it was unclear how to comply with the Buy American requirements in \na reasonable way and that the guidance was lacking or difficult to understand. For example, Colorado Springs \nofficials said that DOE did not have a list of eligible vendors and that trying to ensure compliance with the Buy \nAmerican requirement delayed their light emitting diode (LED) street lighting-replacement projects by at least 4 \nmonths.103 For Berks County, Pennsylvania, officials, it was difficult to determine the source of some components \nof a product and therefore whether the product could be used. NASEO representatives said that DOE's guidance \ndid not provide sufficient detail to enable officials to determine the types of brands or goods they could purchase \nand that recipients did not have the expertise to trace the supply chain of manufactured goods to determine origin. \nIn recent months, DOE has made numerous attempts to help recipients understand Buy American requirements, \nincluding guidance e-mailed to all recipients in May, a webinar in June, and subsequent notice to recipients \n\n\n\nregarding the guidance. DOE officials did note that they were concerned about providing lists of vendors because \nthat might be viewed as an endorsement of particular vendors at the potential exclusion of other eligible vendors\n\nDOE officials said that DOE cannot recommend specific products, in part, due to the large number of eligible \nproducts and because of the potential ethical and liability concerns associated with a federal agency recommending \nspecific manufacturers\n\nWhile many recipients have not had problems understanding program requirements and have successfully \nnavigated requirements through training and technical assistance provided by project officers, DOE is working to \ngive project officers the tools to better assist recipients in navigating DOE guidance. In particular, since March and \nApril 2010, DOE has added staff in order to reduce the workload of project officers and monitors, which DOE \nofficials believe has increased its responsiveness to recipients in clarifying guidance. In addition, as of July 2010, \nDOE is\n\nRecovery Act providing project officers with the Automated Standard Application for Payment (ASAP) reports, so \nthat they can monitor the drawdown of funds\n\nDOE has also recently standardized e-mail distribution lists and provided more frequent communication to \nrecipients\n\nDOE and States Are Beginning to Monitor Grants, as Many Localities Rely on Existing Controls DOE monitors grant \nrecipients primarily through its project officers and monitors. DOE project officers and monitors work directly with \nrecipients to provide guidance and evaluate performance. They also gather and analyze information about project \nplanning, implementation, and outcomes to help ensure data quality and to ensure that statutory requirements are \nmet. There are three levels of review desktop, on-site, and work-site reviews. During desktop monitoring, monitors \nexamine recipients' reports to assess progress and determine compliance with federal rules and regulations, goals, \nand objectives of the grants and the reporting and tracking of resources expended by the recipient and its \nsubrecipients. During on-site monitoring, monitors review deficiencies identified through routine monitoring and how \nthe recipient is resolving the outstanding quality and operational issues. On-site monitoring may also include \ninterviews with contractors to determine whether follow-up protocols were conducted and deficiencies were \ncorrected. During work- site monitoring, monitors review the project, facility, or building being completed. One of the \nproject officers' key functions is to conduct both on-site and desktop monitoring. DOE monitoring is conducted at \nminimum frequencies (see table 10), depending on the funding received by the recipient, and can be increased if \nproject officers have sufficient cause, resources, time, and approval of management. In these reviews, project \nofficers evaluate both financial and project status by evaluating financial records, activities, budgets, and spending \nplans to ensure sufficient progress is being made against planned activities. The monitoring questions were \nupdated on July 30, 2010, downsizing the number of questions asked from over 100 to about 30 questions in on-\nsite reviews and about 6 multi-part questions in quarterly reviews. Now, the desktop monitoring quarterly checklist \nconsists of financial questions such as \"For each activity, does the expenditure match, within reason, the amount of \nwork completed?\" and programmatic questions such as \"For each activity, is the grantee on track to meet \nperformance goals?\" DOE is also developing guidance that includes best practices for how states should monitor \ntheir subrecipients\n\nRecovery Act 104Grant recipients may include states, cities, counties, and Native American tribes\n\n105Subrecipients For states, this term defines nonentitled (to direct federal funding) cities and counties, and for \ncities and counties, the term typically defines subcontractors and vendors\n\n106In addition, DOE officials told us that DOE is developing guidance that includes best practices on how states \nshould monitor their subrecipients\n\nTable 10 DOE Requirements for Frequency of Monitoring Type of monitoring Localities receiving greater than $2 \nmillion Localities receiving $1 million to $2 million Localities receiving $250,000 to $1 million Localities receiving \nless than $250,000 Desktop reviews Monthly Quarterly Quarterly Quarterly On-site reviews 1-2 per year 1 in the life \n\n\n\nof the grant 1 in the life of the grant for 25% of the grants 1 in the life of the grant for 10% of the grants Work-site \nreviews As needed As needed As needed As needed Source DOE\n\nAs of July 28, 2010, DOE has conducted 3,985 desktop reviews of the EECBG program, and about 170 on-site \nreviews. Through its monitoring, DOE has found that smaller recipients have been more likely to fail to complete \nquarterly programmatic and financial reporting to DOE. While 97 percent of larger recipients (recipients with grants \ngreater than $2 million) have completed required quarterly reports due April 30, only 79 percent of recipients \nreceiving less than $250,000 completed quarterly reports\n\nWhile DOE monitors its grant recipients (as well as conducts work-site reviews of subrecipients as needed), grant \nrecipients104 are expected to monitor their subrecipients.105 While DOE does not expect grant recipients to have a \nformal monitoring plan, DOE does require that state recipients \"develop a sub-granting process...that prevents \nfraudulent spending\"106 DOE is also developing guidance that includes best practices for how states should \nmonitor their subrecipients. Several of the states we visited do have a formal plan in place for monitoring their \nsubrecipients. A few of the states we visited have begun monitoring their subrecipients. For example, Colorado \nreviews monthly reports prepared by subrecipients, Michigan project managers review detailed expenditure and \nemployment data submitted by subrecipients on a quarterly basis, and Massachusetts is beginning to monitor \nsubrecipients through regular interactions with subrecipients\n\nRecovery Act 107GAO, Recovery Act States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address \nImplementation Challenges and Bolster Accountability, GAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C. May 26, 2010)\n\n108Standard programmatic metrics are categorized by EECBG activity. For example, a recipient undertaking a \nbuilding retrofit must report on five metrics-outlay of Recovery Act funding, outlay of non-Recovery Act funding, \nobligations, number of buildings retrofitted (by sector), and square footage of buildings retrofitted (by sector)\n\nDOE also expects localities to have a system for monitoring to ensure that subrecipients comply with EECBG \nrequirements. However, for localities that received direct funding, and as we also found in our May 2010 report on \nDOE's Weatherization Assistance Program, DOE provides localities with discretion in developing and implementing \ninternal controls, and as a result, several localities we visited did not have a formal monitoring plan in place for \nmonitoring subrecipients or work performed.107 Many of the localities we visited have developed a system for \nmonitoring, which may include monitoring procedures such as evaluation of the reasonableness of costs, \nmonitoring of building improvements and post-improvement audits, checking payroll for compliance with Davis-\nBacon requirements, checking the validity of expenses, and announced and unannounced site visits\n\nHowever, despite guidance on how to report jobs, it is unclear if all localities' systems for monitoring include \nmeasures to ensure the reliability of reported data. For example, in one locality, an official reported that there were \nno data quality steps to ensure the reliability of the total job count. Another recipient said that it requested greater \nclarification on what was expected from DOE regarding internal controls but did not get more than a general answer \nabout providing good accountability for the use of funds\n\nRecipients Face Challenges as They Begin to Report Outcomes While DOE Works to Provide Guidance EECBG \nrecipients are required to report on outcomes quarterly to DOE on three categories of activity and results metrics. \nThe categories are jobs created or retained; standard programmatic metrics, such as obligations, outlays, and \nmetrics associated with the EECBG activity undertaken;108 and other critical metrics, such as energy savings and \nenergy cost savinRecipients report to DOE through its Performance and Accountability for Grants in Energy system \n(PAGE). In addition, recipients of grants greater than $2 million must report to DOE monthly on funds spent and \nfunds obligated, amount of relevant activity completed, and additional information as required per activity. Several \nrecipients we visited were reporting programmatic metrics such as obligations, expenditures, and jobs created. In \naddition, several recipients we visited were just beginning to implement projects. However, DOE officials have told \nus that they are\n\nRecovery Act not required to report until the completion of their projects. As a result, several recipients do not yet \nhave data to report for critical outcome metrics such as energy savings and emissions reductions\n\n\n\nSome recipients we visited experienced challenges reporting outcomes using these metrics. For example, in one \nlocality, officials said that they planned to estimate jobs because they do not have hourly contracts\n\nSimilarly, in another locality, officials were not aware of how to calculate full-time equivalents (FTE) per OMB \nguidance. In addition, because they experienced challenges in measuring impact metrics, recipients in Georgia \nhave a variety of methods for calculating a metric value. For example, officials from Columbus, Georgia, stated that \nenergy savings from upgrades to traffic lights will be estimated by making assumptions on the amount of energy \nused by the original lights compared to improved traffic lights. A Warner Robins, Georgia, official explained the city \nintends to report project impacts by comparing past monthly utility bills for the water treatment plant to new monthly \nutility bills. To measure the impact of energy efficiency improvements, Cobb County, Georgia, plans a mixed \napproach. According to officials, the county will take field measurements of the performance of old equipment prior \nto removal and replacement equipment as well as use energy models or engineering estimates, including estimates \nprovided by the county's energy audit consultant\n\nCobb County also intends to use the new energy software procured through the EECBG grant to benchmark and \ntrack energy use, cost, and savings and revise calculations based on observed energy usage for each facility. To \nhelp ensure consistency, Georgia has provided guidance from DOE to its subrecipients detailing instructions on \nestimating and reporting energy savings\n\nIn addition, some recipients experienced challenges in the process for reporting metrics, especially due to DOE's \nreporting system, PAGE. DOE provides resources to assist recipients in navigating the PAGE reporting system \non a Web site and offers assistance to recipients via a helpdesk\n\nHowever, several recipients described the reporting process as overwhelming or frustrating and that reporting \nwas time consuming and required extensive resources. One DOE project official said he would like to see the \nreporting process streamlined because it is too complicated for recipients. An official from one EECBG locality in \nCalifornia said that if he had known about the extent of the reporting burden, he may not have applied for the \ngrant. In particular, some recipients said the PAGE reporting system was not user-friendly, and others were \nconfused about what to input into the PAGE system. Similarly, one DOE project officer said that it seems that every \ntime recipients log in, there is a new structure\n\nRecovery Act or a new report that is required to be filled out. Other grant recipients said that using OMB's \nfederalreporting.gov and DOE's PAGE system is difficult because the systems ask for information to be reported in \ndifferent ways\n\nIn addition, some officials have reported challenges in understanding for how many quarters they are required to \nreport some metrics, especially energy saved once a project has been implemented\n\nAdding to recipients' frustration about the reporting process has been the volume of contact from various DOE \noffices about reporting requirements or changes in reporting requirements. For example, one DOE project officer \nthat we spoke with said that grant recipients have expressed frustration at having received so much e-mail about \nguidance or changes to guidance received from different DOE offices. In addition, in Redding, California, officials \ninitially expressed frustration that questions about reporting guidance required calls to several DOE staff to find the \nright person to answer their questions. Kent County, Michigan, officials said that reporting has been challenging \nbecause of the multiple guidance released and because DOE's PAGE system was not user-friendly\n\nDOE is beginning to take steps to deal with the amount of guidance and requirements being provided to recipients. \nDOE plans to issue guidance in August 2010 to assist recipients in navigating the PAGE system, how to correctly \ncategorize metrics and how to interpret and understand financial reporting requirements. In addition, DOE expects \nto issue formal guidance for the reporting period ending August 30, 2010, in which DOE will no longer require \nrecipients with formula awards greater than $2 million to report obligations and performance metrics on a monthly \nbasis. In addition, all recipients will no longer report hours worked through nonfederal funds or outlays of \nnonfederal funds on a quarterly basis. DOE estimates that these changes will increase administrative reporting \nefficiency by approximately 40 percent across the program. In addition, in June 2010, DOE began an effort called \n\n\n\n\"One Voice\" that is intended to improve and streamline communication with recipients. This effort will entail the \ncirculation of a weekly newsletter with announcements regarding guidance, training, and events and will also \ninclude an effort to streamline communication via e-mail. DOE is also working on developing specific requirements \nfor closing out EECBG grants that should clarify when recipients can stop reporting, and a working group within \nDOE plans to clarify the energy metrics reporting guidance\n\nRecovery Act 109Along with the states, and the District, the U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, Northern \nMarianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands also received funds\n\nRecipients of State Energy Program Funds Are Beginning to Obligate Funds, Monitor, and Report on Project \nOutcomes The Recovery Act appropriated $3.1 billion to the State Energy Program (SEP), which is to be \nadministered by the Department of Energy (DOE) and spent over a 3-year period by the states, U.S. territories, and \nthe District of Columbia (the District) for 56 recipients.109 The SEP provides funds through formula grants to \nachieve national energy goals such as increasing energy efficiency and decreasing energy costs. Created in 1996, \nthe SEP has typically received less than $50 million per year. As such, the Recovery Act provided a substantial \nincrease in funding for this program\n\nRecipients Are Making Progress Obligating Recovery Act Funds Recipients are making progress obligating SEP \nfunds, according to August 30, 2010, data from DOE. As of August 30, 27 states, territories, and the District of \nColumbia reported obligating at least 80 percent of their funds, meeting a departmental goal, with another 24 \nstates and territories reporting obligating between 50 percent and 80 percent of their funds\n\nSome states and territories continued to lag in obligating funds- 5 states and territories reported obligating less \nthan 50 percent of their funds\n\nCurrently, a limited amount of national data is available on planned or actual state spending trends. DOE officials \nnoted that they would not have final aggregate national spending data until the funds are fully obligated by \nrecipients in late 2010. Until that time, funding may still shift among spending categories. The data provide \ninformation on different spending categories that have been recommended by DOE to recipients. The most recent \ndata available in August 2010 indicated that the funds were directed to the following - buildings (50 percent)-\nprograms such as school and government improvements, energy-efficiency building code adoption and training, \nand revolving loan programs\n\n- electric power and renewable energy (30 percent)-examples include wind turbine deployment, ground source heat \npumps, and solar generation\n\n- industry (8 percent)-programs such as those for energy audits, waste reduction management, water conservation, \nand manufacturing energy efficiencies\n\nRecovery Act 110Totals do not sum to 100 percent due to rounding\n\n- policy, planning, and energy security (4 percent), which includes programs such as developing state energy \nstrategic plans, energy policy development, and legislative initiatives\n\n- transportation (4 percent), which includes programs related to mass transit use, bike to work, telecommuting, and \nstreet light replacement\n\n- energy education (3 percent)-specific programs include those such as curricula development and K-12 education, \ntraining workshops, and technical and college course development.110 Recipients Are Targeting Recovery Act \nFunds on a Variety of Different Projects Nationally, as of August 25, 2010, approximately 75 percent ($2.31 billion) \nof funds have been obligated by recipients and 10.8 percent ($332 million) have been spent, out of the total $3.07 \nbillion in SEP funds available for grants. Individually, state recipients have reported targeting funds to meet \nRecovery Act goals such as creating or retaining jobs while also generating-long term benefits such as energy and \ncost savings. Recipients have prioritized their spending priorities differently - California allocated the largest portion \n\n\n\nof its $226 million in total funds-$110 million-to improve various types of facilities, including residential, municipal, \nand commercial buildings - New York allocated the largest portion of its $123 million in funds- $74 million-for energy \nconservation projects energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean fleets\n\n- Pennsylvania targeted the largest share of its $99.7 million in funds- $22.8 million-to help leverage private \ninvestments from wind energy developers and manufacturers to develop projects through a state wind initiative\n\nRecipients Are Uncertain of DOE Funding Milestones and Deadlines Though recipients are making progress \nmeeting DOE funding goals, state energy officials noted uncertainty with meeting changing DOE obligation \ntimetables. For example, in the initial funding announcement sent by DOE on April 24, 2009, DOE stated that funds \nmust be obligated by recipients within 18 months of the award of the grant or face potential cancellation by DOE \nand spent within 36 months. However, the same guidance also indicates that 100 percent of funds must be \nobligated by September 30, 2010, to meet departmental and congressional goals. State energy officials noted that \nDOE later provided an updated correspondence on April 21,\n\nRecovery Act 111GAO-10-604\n\n2010, informing states that they were encouraged to obligate 80 percent of their funds by June 30, 2010, and spend \n20 percent by September 30, 2010\n\nDOE officials stated that the June 30 date was meant to help keep states on track to meet the September 30 goal. \nIn many cases, however, states interpreted these dates as new deadlines and were concerned that they would lose \naccess to funds partly because they had experienced pressure from both the administration and the department to \nmeet these new funding milestones. DOE officials stated that they would be unable to deobligate the funds from \nstates if the funding milestones were not met but also stated that they did not know whether funds could be \nreappropriated if states are unable to obligate those funds by September 30, 2010, as policy guidance has not been \nprovided by the administration and Congress. We have previously reported that DOE has provided unclear funding \ndeadlines for the Recovery Act weatherization program, creating confusion among state recipients trying to meet \nDOE Recovery Act deadlines.111 Lack of Guidance and Other Obstacles Hampered Obligating and Spending \nFunds State energy officials told us that delays by DOE in providing guidance hampered early obligating and \nspending on Recovery Act projects. For example, both Iowa and New York state energy officials noted that they \nwaited for DOE to provide guidance before moving forward on projects\n\nAdditionally, other state energy officials we spoke with through the National Association of State Energy Officials \n(NASEO) stated that while DOE guidance has significantly improved, it was not always timely or complete for \nissues such as the Recovery Act's Buy American and Davis- Bacon requirements. For example, similarly to the \nproblems noted by EECBG funding recipients, several state energy officials said that while DOE provided broad \nguidance for meeting Buy American requirements, this guidance did not provide sufficient detail that would enable \nofficials to determine the types of brands or types of goods they could or could not purchase. DOE officials stated \nthat DOE is not capable of recommending specific products requested by recipients partly because of the large \nnumber of products requested. Further, DOE officials stated that there were potential ethical and liability concerns \nassociated with a federal agency recommending specific manufacturers\n\nWhile the state officials stated that they did ask DOE for further advice, the response was not always timely. As an \nexample, several state energy officials described one Recovery Act project that was held up several\n\nRecovery Act 112Categorical exclusions are provided to types (or classes) of actions that normally do not have the \npotential to cause significant environmental impacts and, thus, are categorically excluded from the need to prepare \nan environmental assessment or environmental impact statement\n\n113See http//www1.eere.energy.gov/recovery/buy_american_provision.html\n\nweeks in order to determine if energy-efficient lights purchased for the project met Buy American requirements. \nStates further encountered challenges with meeting National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and National \n\n\n\nHistoric Preservation Act policies. DOE officials acknowledged that NEPA requirements had added significant time \nto the process but stated that progress had been made through the use of categorical exclusions for projects.112 \nAs of August 23, 2010, 87 percent ($2.65 billion) of all SEP Recovery Act-funded projects have been granted \ncategorical exclusions, and 75 percent ($2.31 billion) of funds have been obligated to subrecipients for specific \nactivities. Pennsylvania officials noted that National Historic Preservation Act requirements had slowed some \nprojects but that the situation has improved through an agreement set up between DOE and the state historic \npreservation offices. While DOE officials have acknowledged they initially lacked the infrastructure necessary for \nrapid implementation of a SEP, they noted that DOE has made significant improvements in the level of guidance \nprovided to recipients. For example, DOE has developed a Web site to provide information and guidance for \nrecipients to comply with the Buy American requirements.113 DOE officials further stated that in addition to their \nguidance, states can also contact their DOE project officer for assistance on meeting Recovery Act and program \nrequirements and deadlines. Overall, state energy officials spoke positively about their project officers, though DOE \nhas only recently filled many of these positions\n\nSeveral state energy officials also noted that other obstacles such as the lack of energy management staff has \nmade it more difficult to administer SEP projects. Specifically, District officials stated it was difficult to hire highly \nqualified people because potential staff did not want to leave a current permanent position for a temporary \nRecovery Act position that might only last 2 years. Similarly, Iowa officials noted that their efforts were hindered by \nthe loss of two key staff in 2010 and that they did not want to hire staff for a limited duration. Additionally, \nCalifornia's state auditor reported in December 2009 that the state was not prepared to administer Recovery Act \nfunds for the SEP and listed insufficient staffing as one cause for the lack of preparedness. The report also \nindicated that\n\nRecovery Act 114California State Auditor, Bureau of State Audits, California Energy Resources Conservation and \nDevelopment Commission It Is Not Fully Prepared to Award and Monitor Millions in Recovery Act Funds and Lacks \nControls to Prevent Their Misuse, Letter Report 2009-119.1 (Sacramento, Calif., Dec. 1, 2009)\n\nthe lack of preparedness raised the potential for misuse of Recovery Act funds.114 California officials stated that \nfollowing the state auditor's report, they have since taken actions to address inadequate staffing through the hiring \nof additional contractors\n\nTracking of Recovery Act Spending for SEP Can Take Place Significantly after the Funds Have Been Obligated \nBoth state recipients and DOE reported that the final reporting of spending of state energy funds can take place \nsignificantly after the funds have been obligated and work has begun. For example, District officials told us that \nschool improvements were scheduled for late June, but the funds would not be reported as spent until significantly \nlater because the contractor would not be paid until the work was completed. District officials also noted there would \nalso be an additional delay in reporting the final outlay because the work was being conducted though a sister \nagency\n\nPennsylvania officials also reported delays between the time work was performed and the final spending was \nreported. State officials told us that they reimburse SEP subrecipients on a cost reimbursement system, after work \nis completed and invoices and proof of payment have been submitted, reviewed, and approved. District and \nPennsylvania officials both said that reimbursing costs only after work is completed helps to ensure that the funds \nare spent appropriately. DOE officials stated that they have tried to increase the speed at which invoices have been \npaid to better demonstrate the timely use of Recovery Act funds. For example, through program guidance, DOE has \nencouraged states to pay contractors after specific work milestones have been achieved rather than after the \nproject has been completed\n\nDOE Is Beginning to Monitor Recovery Act Recipient Spending DOE officials stated that they are currently on track \nto meet their monitoring goals. The SEP Recovery Act Monitoring Plan developed by DOE calls for each recipient to \nbe visited twice a year. DOE officials stated that the plan provides guidance for various classes of enhanced \nmonitoring and visitation, but leaves it to the discretion of the DOE field office to plan these trips. DOE state project \nofficers give priority, on a case by case basis, to recipients facing special challenges. The frequency of monitoring \n\n\n\nmay be increased if prior monitoring reports uncovered significant deficiencies in how a recipient is administering \nand managing its program. Visits to recipients with low obligation or expenditure rates are focused on providing \ntechnical assistance to help increase the rates\n\nRecovery Act Overall, DOE officials stated that on-site monitoring will increase as payments grow larger\n\nDOE also conducts on-site monitoring visits at the subrecipient- local agency-level. DOE's target is to conduct on-\nsite monitoring of about 10 percent of all subrecipients nationwide. However, if the risks to the particular state are \nhigher, then the state would be given closer attention by DOE staff for potential assistance. While DOE does \nconduct some on- site monitoring of subrecipients, the officials clarified that the main monitoring relationship is \nbetween the state recipient, the state energy official, and the DOE project officer. DOE officials stated that they view \nstate recipient monitoring as DOE's main responsibility\n\nDOE reported that it is on track to meet its monitoring goals - As of late June 2010, DOE staffed a total of 29 \nproject officers to 56 recipients, exceeding its goals of one officer per two recipients\n\nThough meeting their goal, DOE officials noted that 12 of these officers had been hired in the past 6 weeks\n\n- By the end of September 2010, DOE anticipates that all 56 recipients will have received the first of their required \nannual site visits, with the second follow-up site visit to be performed by the end of the calendar year. In addition to \non-site monitoring of the states, project officers are also required to visit between 5 percent and 10 percent of all \nsubrecipients each year\n\n- To date, DOE has not determined any projects that are \"at variance,\" indicating a high risk for funding misuse\n\nDOE officials noted that the primary monitoring challenge facing project officers and state recipients during desktop \nand on-site visits is gathering the quantity of information and other process indicators needed for compliance \ncertification by the project officer. DOE officials stated that assistance from the field offices, the technical \nassistance provider network, and best practices from the state's own NASEO peer organization are helping to \naddress this situation to assist states in developing effective documentation in a timely manner\n\nRecipient Monitoring Practices Vary, and Some Recipients Are Just Starting Recovery Act Projects Planned state \nrecipient monitoring practices vary, and some recipients are just beginning their monitoring activities because they \nare just starting projects. For example, District officials plan to monitor projects via video and desk monitoring but \nnoted that they have not yet started monitoring in\n\nRecovery Act the field. Planned monitoring will focus on ensuring that the work being done is consistent with the \nagreed-upon scope of work. Additionally, District officials have developed monitoring procedures that will include \nmonitoring checklists of programmatic and financial questions, desktop monitoring, and financial monitoring by the \nDistrict SEP/Recovery Act financial Officer. Pennsylvania has also developed monitoring procedures; project \nadvisers from state regional offices are assigned to each SEP project and, using an inspection form, conduct initial \nand final inspections of projects and are encouraged to perform other inspections as needed\n\nProject advisers also communicate on a weekly basis with SEP recipients and update project status in the agency's \nreporting system\n\nSome state recipients in our review are also using independent contractors to aid in grant monitoring at varying \nlevels. For example, Colorado, California, and New York all reported hiring outside contractors to supplement their \nmonitoring activities. Colorado hired an outside firm to manage its rebate program for appliances, energy- efficient \nmeasures, and renewable-energy systems, citing a need for expertise to handle the large growth in the program \ndue to the addition of Recovery Act funds\n\nAdditionally, Colorado also recently issued a Request for Proposal for measurement and verification activities for its \ngrant funds. Due to the significant increase in the size of Colorado energy programs, Colorado officials determined \n\n\n\nthat oversight by state program managers alone is no longer sufficient. California officials set aside $6 million of its \n$226 million grant to hire contractors to provide, among other things, monitoring, verification, and audit support\n\nThough still in their early stages of oversight, some state energy officials have noted monitoring challenges. For \nexample, Arizona officials noted that some rural grant recipients were more challenging to monitor due to their \nremote location. Additionally, Colorado officials told us that detecting fraud in rebate programs is difficult and that \nwhile the contractor administering the program has procedures in place to detect fraudulent rebate claims, it is not \npossible to ensure that 100 percent of the claims will be legitimate. Colorado officials further noted that there was \nnot a clear standard for how to monitor certain programs such as rebate programs. DOE officials have \nacknowledged that grant programs such as revolving loan programs can require special skill sets to monitor and \nreported that they are taking steps to provide recipients with technical resources by early September 2010\n\nRecovery Act DOE and Recipients Have Reported Challenges in Meeting Recovery Act Outcome Reporting \nRequirements DOE officials stated that recipients have experienced challenges with meeting Recovery Act \nreporting requirements. Similar to EECBG, DOE requires monthly and quarterly reporting by SEP recipients to \nDOE. DOE officials stated that many state recipients have as many as 17 different Recovery Act programs and \nmust coordinate with many different state agencies to fulfill their reporting requirements. In turn, state agencies \nmust also coordinate with local agencies. The officials said that they faced the problem of balancing state and DOE \nneeds with collecting information; asking states to collect too much information would be overly burdensome, while \ncollecting insufficient information would not allow states or DOE to track long-term outcomes. To help decrease the \nadministrative burden of reporting, DOE decreased both its monthly and quarterly reporting requirements effective \nfor the August 30, 2010, reporting deadline. The changes will decrease the amount of job, performance, and \nfunding information reporting required and will help states focus on expending Recovery Act funds\n\nBoth DOE and state energy officials have noted that reporting on outcome measures has been limited because \nSEP Recovery Act projects are in their early stages. For example, DOE officials stated that SEP recipients first had \nto report quarterly beginning in January 2010 but that the early reports by recipients did not include many critical \nmetrics, such as total energy saved and dollars savings. DOE officials further stated that because outcomes such \nas total energy cost savings take time to achieve, and because the state energy offices were still in the initiation \nphases earlier in 2010, there are few outcomes to report. State officials have also noted that outcome data are \ncurrently limited due to the early stage of SEP Recovery Act projects. For example, District energy officials noted \nthat they won't have data on calculating energy savings until projects are complete\n\nSpecifically, the District plans to report on energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions by calculating the \nbuilding square footage, pre- and post- installation utility bills, as well as the energy-savings measures installed and \nthe dollars spent. On-site monitoring will be an important part of the verification process\n\nState energy officials have indicated difficulties with reporting information into DOE's primary reporting system, \nPAGE. For example, Iowa noted that PAGE was not compatible with their existing grant management system or \nother federal reporting systems, which meant that data had to be input twice. DOE's Inspector General also \ndescribed significant issues with\n\nRecovery Act 115U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Inspector General, Management Controls over the \nDevelopment and Implementation of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Performance and \nAccountability for Grants in Energy System, OAS-RA-10-14 (July 22, 2010)\n\n116During an energy audit, auditors visually inspect the building shell and mechanical systems; conduct diagnostic, \nhealth, and safety tests; and record the location, condition, and dimensions of walls, ceilings, floors, windows, \ndoors, and mechanical systems\n\nAccording to DOE, before work is conducted, auditors should use this information to select cost-effective measures \nthat would make the unit more energy-efficient and prepare work orders to ensure that appropriate measures are \ninstalled. After weatherization work is completed, another energy audit and final inspection should be conducted\n\n\n\nAlong with other concerns, the report indicated that DOE officials \"did not seek input from grant recipients-the \nsystem's external users-related to the design of PAGE due to the limited time before the system had to be \noperational.\" To assist states with reporting, a NASEO official stated that DOE has asked NASEO to work with \neach recipient to complete the submissions through PAGE. Additionally, DOE officials stated that the contractor that \ndeveloped PAGE is providing additional assistance and feedback to the recipients on data entry issues\n\nPAGE in a recent report.115 DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program The Recovery Act appropriated $5 billion \nfor the Weatherization Assistance Program, which the Department of Energy (DOE) is distributing to each of the \nstates, the District of Columbia (District), all five territories, and two Indian tribes. According to DOE, during the past \n33 years, weatherization has helped more than 6.4 million low-income families by making long-term energy-\nefficiency improvements to their homes such as installing insulation; sealing leaks; and modernizing heating \nequipment, air circulation fans, and air conditioning equipment. These improvements enable families to reduce \nenergy bills, allowing them to spend their money on more pressing needs. The Recovery Act appropriation \nrepresents a significant increase for a program that has received about $225 million per year in recent years\n\nDuring 2009, DOE obligated about $4.73 billion of the Recovery Act's weatherization funding to the states, \nterritories, and tribes, while retaining about 5 percent of funds to cover the department's expenses. Initially, DOE \nprovided each recipient with the first 10 percent of its allocated funds, which could be used for start-up activities \nsuch as hiring and training staff, purchasing needed equipment, and performing energy audits of homes, among \nother things.116 Before recipients could receive the next 40 percent of their funds, DOE required each to submit a \nweatherization\n\nRecovery Act 117June 30, 2010, is the most recent quarter for which the states are required to report data under \nthe Recovery Act. The 58 recipients include all of the states, the District, all five territories, and two Indian tribes\n\n118Based on June production totals, DOE released the remaining 50 percent of funds to 19 states Arizona, \nColorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, \nNevada, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Based on July production totals, DOE \nreleased the remaining 50 percent of funds to the following three states Kentucky, North Dakota, and Wyoming\n\n119Our discussion on weatherization is limited to the following 7 states and the District of Columbia that are the \nfocus of this report Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New York, and Pennsylvania\n\nplan outlining how it would use its Recovery Act weatherization funds\n\nThese plans identified the number of homes to be weatherized and included strategies for monitoring and \nmeasuring performance. By the end of 2009, DOE had approved the weatherization plans of all 58 recipients and \nhad provided all recipients with half of their weatherization funds under the Recovery Act.117 According to DOE \nofficials, as of June 30, 2010, about 166,000 homes have been weatherized nationwide, or about 29 percent of the \napproximately 570,000 homes currently planned for weatherization. To release the remaining 50 percent of funds, \nDOE requires that recipients complete weatherizing 30 percent of the homes identified in their weatherization plans \nand meet other requirements- namely, fulfilling the monitoring and inspection protocols established in its \nweatherization plan; monitoring each of its local agencies at least once each year to determine compliance with \nadministrative, fiscal, and state policies and guidelines; ensuring that local quality controls are in place; inspecting \nat least 5 percent of completed units during the course of the respective year; and submitting timely and accurate \nprogress reports to DOE, and monitoring reviews, to confirm acceptable performance\n\nRecovery Act funds are available for obligation by DOE until September 30, 2010, and DOE has indicated that the \nrecipients are to spend their Recovery Act weatherization funds by March 31, 2012\n\nRecipients' Access to Recovery Act Funding for Weatherization Varies Due to Uneven Progress in Meeting DOE's \nRequirements Recipients' ability to access all of their Recovery Act weatherization funding by meeting DOE's \nrequirements varies considerably. DOE records indicate that as of June 30, 2010, 29 states had weatherized at \nleast 30 percent of their total planned units. As of August 2010, DOE reported it had released the remaining 50 \n\n\n\npercent of funds to 22 states that had met the other requirements.118 Of the 7 states and the District in our review \nfor the Recovery Act weatherization program, two states, Iowa and Arizona, have been granted access to their \nremaining 50 percent.119 In Iowa, DOE\n\nRecovery Act 120As of June 30, 2010, the agency responsible for administering the Recovery Act weatherization \nprogram had not yet approved weatherization of multifamily residences, but it reported having received proposals\n\n121See GAO-10-604\n\n122See GAO-10-604\n\nreleased about $40.4 million after the state reported its completion of weatherizing 2,179 homes-more than 30 \npercent of its target of 7,196 homes. Similarly, in Arizona, officials reported the state had weatherized 1,930 \nhomes, about 30 percent of its 6,414 total estimated homes, and gained access to the remaining $28.5 million\n\nAdditionally, other states, such as California and Florida, are close to meeting their 30 percent production targets. \nDespite a delayed start in spending Recovery Act funds, California reported weatherizing 8,679 homes out of its \ntotal estimated production target of 43,150 units as of June 30, 2010. Similarly, Florida officials reported a total of \n3,878 single- family residences had been weatherized, or about 20 percent of the total 19,090.120 Furthermore, \nboth California and Florida officials report they are on track to weatherize 30 percent of their total estimated units \nby September 30, 2010\n\nSome recipients that we found to be behind schedule in our May 2010 report, such as the District and Georgia, \nhave since increased their weatherization of units; however, these recipients still have not met production goals \nrequested by DOE.121 For example, as of March 31, 2010, we found service providers in the District and Georgia \nhad weatherized about 14 percent and 11 percent of homes identified in their state weatherization plans, \nrespectively. By the end of June 2010, although both recipients' production targets were still below DOE's approved \ngoal of 30 percent, the District and Georgia reported they have increased their production to about 25 percent and \nabout 22 percent, respectively\n\nSome Recipients Still Face Challenges with Implementing Internal Controls to Ensure Program Compliance Some \nrecipients are still challenged with establishing controls to ensure compliance with weatherization program and \nRecovery Act requirements\n\nDOE has issued guidance requiring recipients of Recovery Act weatherization funds to implement a number of \ninternal controls to mitigate the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. In our May 2010 report, we recommended that \nDOE should develop best practices for key internal controls that should be present at the local weatherization \nagency level to ensure compliance with key program requirements.122 DOE provides\n\nRecovery Act 123See GAO-10-604\n\nrecipients with the discretion to develop and implement these internal controls in accordance with each state's \nweatherization plan. Local agencies use various methods to prevent fraudulent or wasteful use of Recovery Act \nfunds, such as conducting risk assessments\n\nSince our last report, we have identified challenges in the implementation of internal controls for some local \nweatherization agencies. For example, in the District, we conducted client file reviews and found that while some \nweatherization project data were not present in the physical files, much, but not all, of this data was in an online \nsoftware system used to manage weatherization projects. While the online system appeared to be a useful tool in \nmanaging weatherization projects, it has not yet been fully implemented and does not contain all of the data \nnecessary to track individual weatherization projects from start to finish. As a result, at the time of our review, \nneither the physical files nor the online weatherization management system presented a complete record of \nweatherization projects. District officials reported that they conducted inspections of local weatherization agencies \nin early July 2010-roughly 2 weeks after our review-and found that all agencies they reviewed had copies of all \n\n\n\nrequired documentation in the physical files. Additionally, District officials reported they are continuing to fully \nimplement the online reporting system and address issues associated with incomplete data. In Florida, the state \nagency responsible for administering the program had instituted various management controls over the program, \nbut our review of two local weatherization agencies revealed internal control gaps and compliance issues similar to \nthose identified in our May 2010 report.123 For example, weatherization work done was often not consistent with \nthe recommendations of home energy audits and no reasons were given for the differences; in some instances, \nwork was charged to the program but not done or lacked quality; several potential health and safety issues were not \naddressed; and contractors' prices were not being compared to local market rates, as required by the state \nweatherization agency. State officials have acknowledged these problems and have taken steps to address the \nproblems, including changing procedures and guidelines and instructing contract field monitors to be more attentive \nto these issues. The two local weatherization agencies we reviewed also agreed to take corrective actions\n\nRecovery Act 124See GAO-10-604\n\nMost States We Reviewed Have Varying Levels of Monitoring Procedures Most of the states we reviewed have \noversight procedures in place to monitor local agencies; however, the level of monitoring varies considerably. DOE \nrequires state weatherization agencies to conduct on- site monitoring of all weatherization service providers to \ninspect the management of funds and the production of weatherized homes at least once a year. These monitoring \nvisits consist of a financial review of the service provider's records pertaining to salaries, materials, equipment, and \nindirect costs; program reviews of the service provider's records, contracts, and client files; and a production review, \nconsisting of the inspection of weatherized homes by the state agencies and by the service provider. In our May \n2010 report, we recommended that DOE set time frames for development and implementation of state monitoring \nprograms; DOE generally agreed with this recommendation and indicated it will take steps to address this issue\n\nWe found in the states we reviewed that levels of monitoring varied considerably. Some state monitoring plans are \nfully implemented. For example, in Arizona, state officials reported program monitors conduct file reviews of all \ncompleted units each month using a statewide database\n\nAlso, program monitors visit each of the 10 service providers at least once a month, exceeding DOE's requirement \nof yearly visits to local service providers. Iowa officials reported inspecting at least 5 percent of the weatherized \nhomes for each local agency and providing monitoring at 15 of 18 local agencies\n\nIn contrast, monitoring procedures in other states have either just been fully implemented or are still facing \nchallenges. We identified some issues in our May 2010 report related to weatherization monitoring in Georgia\n\nSome monitoring positions remained vacant, and oversight of the providers had been slow to start.124 However, \nstate officials at the agency responsible for the weatherization assistance program have since taken steps to \naddress these issues. Specifically, they told us that their contractor had filled all monitoring positions, and all 22 of \nits providers have received monitoring visits. Additionally, Pennsylvania officials are still facing challenges. For \nexample, state officials reported weatherization program monitors are not in compliance with some Recovery Act \nmonitoring procedures, and they are not getting about half of their monitoring reports back to the agencies within \n30 days of the site visit\n\nDOE reported the need for Pennsylvania's department responsible for\n\nRecovery Act administering the program to improve the financial management system to better track actual costs \nfor each unit weatherized on a service provider basis. State officials reported they are working on corrective \nactions to address these concerns by August 2010\n\nFinally, some recipients, such as California and the District, were delayed in spending Recovery Act weatherization \nfunds and have just begun to implement monitoring efforts. For example, in California, program officials recently \nbegan on-site monitoring of Recovery Act activity in June 2010, and by July 31, they visited seven of the 38 service \nproviders\n\n\n\nAdditionally, program officials also conduct quarterly performance visits as needed for providers with production \ndeficiencies, monthly Recovery Act expenditure and performance analyses, fiscal monitoring, on-site monitoring of \nwhistleblower complaints and high-risk agencies, and Davis- Bacon on-site reviews to ensure employees are paid \nappropriately and paperwork is in compliance. Similarly, District officials reported a number of monitoring \nprocedures are in place, such as annual monitoring reviews of local weatherization agencies and site inspections of \nat least 10 percent of weatherized units. District officials told us that, as of July 15, 2010, their program managers \nhad conducted monitoring visits of all seven local weatherization agencies, and program auditors had begun \nconducting site inspections for the quality assurance of work completed by contractors\n\nSome States Are Measuring Long-Term Energy Savings Resulting from the Recovery Act Weatherization Funds, \nWhile Others Are Still in Development With respect to energy cost savings, some states are actively measuring \nenergy savings, while others are beginning to develop methods to do so\n\nAs with EECBG and SEP, weatherization recipients are required to report on different program metrics, both \nmonthly and quarterly. A long-term goal of the weatherization program is to increase energy efficiency through cost-\neffective weatherization work, and DOE relies on its recipients to ensure compliance with this cost-effectiveness \nrequirement\n\nFor example, in Arizona, the agency responsible for administering the weatherization program calculates the \nestimated kilowatt hour usage reduction and utility costs savings resulting from weatherization work performed on \nhomes. As of June 2010, officials estimated that Recovery Act weatherization services have resulted in \napproximately $267,000 in savings for the residents in the 1,930 homes weatherized. Florida officials reported \ncontracting with the University of Florida to conduct a study of overall energy savings utilizing consumption data \nobtained from clients' utility bills. Alternatively, District officials are still developing a methodology to capture energy \nsavings for weatherized homes. In July 2010, Georgia officials stated it had begun using a Web-based reporting \ntool to track real-time information on energy savings. In addition, program monitors will track and compare energy \ncosts after weatherization work\n\nRecovery Act 125See GAO-10-604\n\nhas been completed for 3, 6, and 12 months. While California estimated annual energy savings of about $1.5 \nmillion resulting from Recovery Act funds, state officials currently do not anticipate attempting to calculate actual \nenergy savings and noted that they would like more guidance from DOE on its effort to study energy savings\n\nDOE Generally Agreed with the Recommendations Issued in Our May 2010 Report and Has Taken Some Steps \ntoward Implementation In our May 2010 report, we provided eight recommendations and raised concerns about \nwhether program requirements were being met.125 DOE generally agreed with all of our recommendations and has \nbegun to take several steps in response. For example, DOE reported that it has drafted national workload \nstandards to address our concerns regarding training, certification, and accreditation. DOE plans to issue these \nstandards to recipients in October 2010. DOE is still in the process of considering our recommendations and will \nprovide additional information on how they plan to fully implement our recommendations at a later date\n\nHousing Agencies Have Been Using Recovery Act Funds for a Variety of Projects, and HUD's Initial Monitoring \nEfforts Have Identified Problems with Obligations for Some Projects Competitive Grants for Public Housing Capital \nFund Have Supported a Variety of Projects The Recovery Act requires the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) to distribute nearly $1 billion to public housing agencies based on competition for priority \ninvestments, including investments that leverage private sector funding or financing for renovations and energy \nconservation retrofitting. In September 2009, HUD awarded 396 competitive grants in the amount of $995 million to \n212 public housing agencies. (Subsequently, three housing agencies returned competitive grants totaling \napproximately $14 million to HUD). The Recovery Act required housing agencies that received competitive grants to \nobligate 100 percent of their competitive grant funds within 1 year of the date when competitive funds became \navailable to agencies for obligation, which means they have until September 2010 to obligate 100\n\n\n\nRecovery Act 126HUD awarded the competitive grants to housing agencies at varying dates in the month of \nSeptember 2009. As a result, the 1-year deadlines for obligating these funds vary by category of competitive grant. \nThe deadlines include September 8, 2010, September 22, 2010, September 23, 2010, and September 27, 2010 \npercent of their funds.126 As of August 7, 2010, 179 housing agencies reported obligations totaling about $460.1 \nmillion for 340 grants. This reflects about 46.3 percent of the total Public Housing Capital Fund competitive funds \nallocated to them (see fig. 24). In addition, there were 57 grants (14 percent) located at 39 housing agencies for \nwhich no competitive funds had been obligated. Further, another 102 grants (26 percent) had less than 20 percent \nof their funds obligated. As the September 2010 obligation deadline approaches, HUD officials said they are \nworking to ensure that housing agencies meet the deadline, but expect that some housing agencies may not. HUD \nwill recapture any funds not obligated by the deadline and return them to the Department of the Treasury. One \nhundred forty-four housing agencies had also drawn down funds to pay for project expenses already incurred. As of \nAugust 7, 2010, these 144 public housing agencies had drawn down about $93.5 million, or about 9.4 percent of \nthe total allocated to them. The Recovery Act required housing agencies to expend 60 percent of obligated funds \nwithin 2 years and expend 100 percent of Recovery Act funds within 3 years of the initial date when funds were \nprovided to agencies for obligation\n\nRecovery Act Figure 24 Percentage of Public Housing Capital Fund Competitive Grants Allocated by HUD That \nHave Been Obligated and Drawn Down Nationwide as of August 7, 2010 More specifically, housing agencies have \nbeen using their competitive grants for the creation of energy- efficient communities, gap financing for projects \nstalled because of financing issues, public housing transformation, and improvements addressing the needs of the \nelderly or persons with disabilities - For the creation of energy-efficient communities, HUD awarded 36 grants \ntotaling $299.7 million for substantial rehabilitation or new construction and 226 grants totaling $305.8 million for \nmoderate rehabilitation. For example, in New Jersey funds are to be used to incorporate green features in two new \nbuildings with public housing units. Some of the energy-efficient features of the project include water conserving \nfixtures, Energy Star lighting packages in all interior units, and Energy Star or high-efficiency commercial grade \nfixtures in all common areas, as well as daylight sensors or timers on all outdoor lighting. In Massachusetts, funds \nare to be used to reduce the annual energy and water costs of more than $4,000 per unit in a physically distressed \nsite. The project will redevelop a portion of the site into innovative, high-efficiency affordable housing for current \nresidents This figure uses three pie charts to show the percent of funds made available under the Recovery Act for \nthe Public Housing Capital Fund competitive grants that was obligated by HUD to housing agencies, the percent of \nfunds obligated by housing agencies, and the percent of funds drawn down by housing agencies, as of August 7, \n2010\n\nRecovery Act 127Gap financing is the process of providing funding to housing agencies for projects that are ready \nto proceed but are stalled due to the inability of the housing agency to obtain anticipated private funding for the \nprojects\n\nwith the new construction of 96 affordable rental units and a community center\n\n- For gap financing for projects that were stalled due to financing issues, HUD awarded 38 grants totaling $198.8 \nmillion.127 For example, in Pennsylvania, $10 million in funds are to be used to construct 50 units of a 101-unit \ndevelopment that will be a mixture of walk-up and duplex apartments and three-scattered site buildings replacing a \nhigh-rise building demolished in 2008\n\n- For public housing transformation, HUD awarded 15 grants totaling $95.9 million to revitalize distressed or \nobsolete public housing projects. For example, in Illinois, funds are to be used on a multiphase, mixed-finance \nproject that will build public housing, rental, and for- sale apartments and houses on housing agency land and \nvacant city lots\n\n- For improvements addressing the needs of the elderly or persons with disabilities, HUD awarded 81 grants \ntotaling $94.8 million. For example, in Texas, funds are to be used to complete work on common areas to make \nthem accessible and ADA-compliant, upgrade and improve space used for supportive services, and add energy-\nefficient lighting, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning in properties housing the elderly. In California, funds are to \n\n\n\nbe used to provide upgrades to nine dwelling units for accessibility improvements for the elderly and disabled, as \nwell as improvements to common spaces used for supportive services targeted to those residents\n\nAs discussed above, HUD officials expect that some housing agencies may not meet the September 2010 \ncompetitive grant obligation deadline. They noted that among all the competitive grant projects nationwide, the 75 \ngrants supported by mixed-financing have been at greatest risk of missing the obligation deadline. HUD's Office of \nUrban Revitalization has assigned a grant manager to each of the mixed-finance competitive grant projects to track \nand monitor their progress. Officials with 5 of the 10 housing agencies we visited that had received competitive \ngrants told us they were experiencing challenges related to mixed-financing of their projects, but they still \nanticipated meeting the deadline. Because funding for these projects comes from multiple sources, if one financing \nparty is not able to\n\nRecovery Act finalize its part of the contract by the obligation deadline, the housing agency will not be able to close \non the contract. As a result, the housing agency would not be able to obligate its competitive grant funds on time \nand the funds would be recaptured. For example, one housing agency is relying on a 4 percent low-income housing \ntax credit to pay for about $10 million of the $40 million cost for the first phase of its project. The 4 percent tax credit \nwas contingent on the state selling tax-exempt bonds, and according to HUD field office officials, the state's \ndifficulty doing so had prevented the housing agency from securing the tax credit. State officials told us they notified \nthe project developer on August 5, 2010, that the tax-exempt bonds, which will generate the tax credits, had been \napproved, which would allow the housing agency to submit its final paperwork to HUD by September 18, 2010 \nAdditionally, HUD field staff have taken several steps to assist public housing agencies in obligating Recovery Act \ncompetitive grant funds by the September 2010 deadline. HUD field officials told us that they have been \ncommunicating regularly with housing agencies via e- mail and telephone to address their questions, provide \ntechnical assistance, and monitor their progress. For example, field staff in one field office in Texas use weekly \nconference calls to communicate with all of the housing agencies in their jurisdiction and answer their questions \nabout obligation- related issues for competitive grants. The officials also told us they have dedicated three staff to \nwork with the five public housing agencies under their jurisdiction that received 14 competitive grants. HUD field \nstaff in Illinois have contacted each competitive grant recipient in their region on a weekly basis and use an internal \ntracking sheet to monitor progress\n\nHUD officials in Massachusetts have provided additional oversight to smaller housing agencies to help them better \nunderstand federal procurement policies. Based in part on these efforts, HUD field staff believed that housing \nagencies in Massachusetts would meet the September 2010 obligation deadline\n\nAs we note in our May 2010 Recovery Act report, HUD plans to redistribute $17.16 million of competitive and \nformula grant funds that were rejected or returned by housing agencies by awarding a new set of\n\nRecovery Act 128According to HUD officials, funds that are recaptured from housing agencies after passage of the \nDodd-Frank Act will have to be returned to the Department of the Treasury (because of congressional concerns \nabout debt reduction, the Dodd-Frank Act required unobligated Recovery Act funds to be returned to the Treasury). \nHowever, because the initial $17.16 million in returned formula and competitive grant funds was returned to HUD \nbefore passage of the act, HUD is still able to redistribute them to other housing agencies\n\n129According to HUD officials, 21 housing agencies refused to accept or returned to HUD approximately $3.26 \nmillion in Recovery Act formula grant funds\n\nHUD plans to redistribute these funds to qualified housing agencies that previously applied for competitive grants \nbut did not receive them because HUD had obligated all of the nearly $1 billion allocated to the program. Given \nHUD's emphasis on green, energy- efficient housing, HUD will limit the redistribution of funds to those applications \nfor energy retrofit projects. Prior to funding any of the remaining applications, HUD planned to verify that potential \nrecipients still would be able to complete the work outlined in their original applications and that they currently are in \ncompliance with Recovery Act requirements. Of the 23 public housing agencies that HUD has contacted and \nverified their eligibility to receive additional competitive grant funds, 22 agencies accepted the additional funds. \n\n\n\nAccording to HUD officials, they may be able to redistribute these funds by the end of fiscal year 2010. According to \nHUD officials, once the housing agencies receive the redistributed funds, housing agencies must obligate 100 \npercent of the funds within 1 year, expend 60 percent within 2 years, and expend 100 percent within 3 years\n\ncompetitive grants.128 Public Housing Capital Fund Formula Grants Have Also Supported a Variety of Projects The \nRecovery Act required HUD to allocate $3 billion through the Public Housing Capital Fund to public housing \nagencies using the same formula for amounts made available in fiscal year 2008. HUD allocated Capital Fund \nformula dollars to 3,134 public housing agencies shortly after passage of the Recovery Act and, after entering into \nagreements with housing agencies, obligated these funds on March 18, 2009. As we previously reported, all \nhousing agencies met the March 17, 2010, obligation deadline for formula grants by either obligating all of their \nfunds or rejecting or returning a portion of the funds.129 The Recovery Act also required that public housing \nagencies expend 60 percent of their formula funds within 2 years from when the funds became available and \nexpend 100 percent of their formula grant funds within 3 years from when the funds became available. Housing \nagencies have been making progress in drawing down funds in accordance with these deadlines. According to \nHUD data, as of August 7, 2010, 3,075 housing agencies had drawn down funds totaling more than $1.6 billion from \nHUD, or about 55 percent of the\n\nRecovery Act total allocated to the housing agencies, to pay for project expenses already incurred (see fig. 25)\n\nFigure 25 Percentage of Public Housing Capital Fund Formula Grants Allocated by HUD That Have Been Obligated \nand Drawn Down Nationwide as of August 7, 2010 Public housing agency officials said they have been using these \nfunds to support a variety of improvement projects at public housing sites, including performing roofing and gutter \nwork, replacing windows and doors, rehabilitating unit interiors, and replacing heating, cooling, and hot water \nsystems. For example, a housing agency in California used formula funds to rehabilitate vacant units at two sites \nquickly to make them available for lease to prospective low-income tenants. Work at both sites included repairing \ndamaged walls, ceilings, and floors; removing old plumbing fixtures; replacing tile and appliances; and painting the \ninteriors of units (see fig. 26)\n\nThis figure uses three pie charts to show the percent of funds made available under the Recovery Act for the Public \nHousing Capital Fund formula grants that was obligated by HUD to housing agencies, the percent of funds \nobligated by housing agencies, and the percent of funds drawn down by housing agencies, as of August 7, 2010\n\nRecovery Act Figure 26 Before and After Photographs of the Alice Griffith Project in San Francisco, California In \nPennsylvania, a housing agency is using formula funds to rehabilitate 23 row houses on the last remaining blighted \nblock adjacent to a large redevelopment the housing agency had already completed. Combined with the previous \nredevelopment, once this project is complete, there will be more than 700 total units in an approximate four square \nblock area. Work on the last block of the development began in March 2010 (see fig. 27)\n\nAccording to housing agency officials, this redevelopment project not only has provided additional public housing \nunits, but also has increased property values for row homes in the area from $40,000 or $50,000 to asking prices of \nup to $125,000\n\nOn the left is a photo of a dilapidated kitchen with an old sink. The sink is supported by a single pole and there is no \ncabinet underneath it\n\nOn the right is a photo of the same kitchen with the sink replaced. The new sink is mounted on top of a new set of \nkitchen cabinets.\n\nRecovery Act 130HUD was concerned that housing agencies may not have followed proper procedures or may \nhave directed funds to ineligible uses in the rush to meet the March 17, 2010, formula grant obligation deadline. \nHUD officials decided to review the obligation documents of those housing agencies that obligated the majority of \ntheir funds just prior to the deadline\n\n\n\nThese quick-look reviews were conducted by HUD field staff using a checklist that included questions such as \nwhether necessary approvals were in place for work items and whether obligations correspond to work items in the \nhousing agency's approved annual plan\n\nFigure 27 Public Housing Rehabilitation Using Recovery Act Capital Fund Competitive Grant in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania Results of HUD's Initial Second Year of Monitoring Efforts Have Identified Few Problems with \nHousing Agencies' Obligations of Funds HUD has employed multiple monitoring efforts for Recovery Act funds and \nhas found that only a few housing agencies had deficiencies relating to their obligations. For the second year of \nimplementation, HUD's strategy for monitoring Recovery Act formula and competitive grant funds includes a \ncombination of remote and on-site reviews of housing agencies' administration of Recovery Act requirements, the \nsame approach it used for monitoring housing agencies during the first year of the Recovery Act\n\nSpecifically for the formula grant funds, HUD developed a four- tier monitoring approach that includes - quick-look \nreviews of all Recovery Act formula grant obligation documents generated from February 26, 2010, to March 17, \n2010, by 543 housing agencies that had obligated less than 90 percent of formula grant funds as of February 26, \n2010. HUD completed the quick- look reviews in July 2010;130 On the left is a photo of a series of brick row \nhouses. The row houses have boarded up or missing windows and doors, and some are covered in graffiti. Parts of \nthe street in front of the row houses are covered in piles of dirt that will be used for rehabilitation of the property\n\nOn the right is a photo of row houses from the same development that have been rehabilitated. The row houses are \nnicely painted and all have new windows, doors, and front steps. The sidewalks are new and the street is clean and \nclutter-free. A new street lamp is visible on the sidewalk.\n\nRecovery Act - on-site and remote reviews. Housing agencies currently designated as troubled will have a minimum \nof one on-site review. Housing agencies that are nontroubled may be subject to additional remote or on-site reviews \ndepending upon factors including having open audit findings, failing to expend funds in prior years, and having \nprocurement-related deficiencies such as not revising procurement policies to reflect Recovery Act requirements. \nHUD anticipates that about 25 percent of grant recipients will be subject to these reviews, which the agency plans \nto complete by February 2011; - quality assurance and quality control reviews by HUD's Office of Field Operations, \nwhich HUD plans to conduct between December 2010 and March 2011; and - independent reviews (performed by \nan outside contractor) of housing agencies that HUD identified as being the top 100 to 125 funded agencies with \nthe largest formula grant award amount. The independent reviews are to be completed by June 2011\n\nAccording to HUD officials, as a result of its quick-look reviews of 543 housing agencies, HUD staff identified 26 \nhousing agencies that were potentially deficient in meeting HUD requirements for obligating formula grant funds \nand required further review. For example, some housing agencies signed contracts to obligate funds after the \nMarch 17, 2010, deadline. HUD staff also determined that some housing agencies obligated funds for products and \nservices that were not approved for Recovery Act use, such as paying the local police department to provide \nsecurity services. In addition, HUD staff identified 24 housing agencies with minor deficiencies that did not warrant \nfurther review. Finally, there were 22 housing agencies that did not submit final documentation requested by HUD \nstaff for the quick-look reviews. HUD plans to conduct on-site reviews of those housing agencies if they do not \nsubmit the requested documentation\n\nHUD created a panel comprised of officials from its Office of Field Operations, Office of Capital Improvements, and \nOffice of General Counsel to examine in greater detail those 26 housing agencies with potential deficiencies \nidentified via the quick-look reviews, as well as potential deficiencies identified by other means. Of the 26 housing \nagencies, the panel determined that deficiencies at 8 housing agencies were significant and necessitated a \nrecapture of funds. As of August 27, 2010, the panel reviews identified approximately $1 million in Recovery Act \nfunds that necessitated recapture. HUD is in the process of recapturing these funds and will return them to the \nDepartment of the Treasury. HUD plans to continue conducting panel reviews and will\n\nRecovery Act 131GAO, Recovery Act One Year Later, States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Opportunities to \nStrengthen Accountability, GAO-10-437 (Washington, D.C. Mar. 3, 2010)\n\n\n\nrecapture Recovery Act funds from any housing agency found to have deficiencies\n\nHUD adopted a similar multireview approach for its second-year monitoring of Recovery Act competitive grant \nfunds. HUD has been conducting remote reviews of all 393 competitive grants and had planned to complete them \nby August 20, 2010. As of August 23, 2010, HUD field staff reported having completed 371 remote reviews of \ncompetitive grants\n\nHUD officials are in the process of analyzing the results of these reviews\n\nWhile HUD officials have not completed their reviews, as of August 27, 2010, the agency may recapture \napproximately $12 million in competitive grant funds based on remote review findings and other means. For \nexample, after reviewing one project's proposed building site, HUD staff found that the project would be located in \nan industrial space next to a railroad track with little access to roadways, raising both transportation and \nenvironmental concerns. HUD also plans to conduct quality assurance and quality control reviews for a random \nsample of 20 to 25 percent of the remote reviews, which HUD plans to complete by September 2010. In October \nand November 2010, HUD also plans to review obligations made by housing agencies that had not fully obligated \ntheir grant funds within 2 weeks of the September 2010 deadline. Finally, from January to March 17, 2011, HUD \nplans to conduct on-site reviews of all eight housing agencies that received competitive grant funds and were \ndesignated as troubled as of September 30, 2009. Given that less than half of the competitive grant funds have \nbeen obligated to date, we believe that it is important for HUD to continue to closely monitor progress in meeting the \nobligation deadline\n\nIn addition, because HUD identified some deficiencies among those housing agencies that obligated their formula \ngrant funds near the deadline, we believe it will be important for HUD also to review those competitive grant \nobligations made by housing agencies just prior to the deadline\n\nAs part of its second-year strategy, HUD developed a management plan for the administration of Recovery Act \nfunds, including the need for an additional 11 FTEs to carry out Recovery Act responsibilities. This was in response \nto our March 2010 recommendation that HUD develop such a plan to address its resource needs for both the \nRecovery Act funds and the existing Capital Fund program.131 Similarly, HUD's Office of Public and\n\nRecovery Act 132Asset management reviews examine how the asset is being managed in areas including whether \nthe housing agencies are renting to the types of tenants specified by the terms of HUD funding, or whether the \nasset is being maintained in accordance with HUD safety standards\n\nIndian Housing also agreed to develop a management plan addressing the activities and resources needed to \nadminister its existing Capital Fund program. In July 2010, HUD provided us with its management plan for the \nPublic Housing Capital Fund program. The plan summarized the key activities HUD undertakes to monitor and \nfacilitate the use of these funds by program area, including rule and policy development, planning, program awards, \nprogram management, technical assistance, and reporting. The plan also included the specific activities, tasks, \nand resources used for each of these existing program areas, identifying approximately 91 existing FTEs in its \nheadquarters and field offices to support these activities. According to HUD's management plan, HUD's current \nstaffing level is sufficient to manage its existing Capital Fund program, but the agency could more efficiently utilize \nits current resources. As a result, HUD plans to realign current staff to focus on its core missions, including \nRecovery Act responsibilities\n\nHUD's management plan for its existing Capital Fund program states that HUD currently has the staff and \nresources required to effectively implement its core programs. However, officials in two HUD field offices we visited \nstated that they revised their oversight strategies for their regular programs to accommodate Recovery Act work. \nFor example, officials in one HUD field office told us that most of the field office's resources have been devoted to \nthe Recovery Act and, as a result, staff have done less on-site monitoring of non- Recovery Act grant recipients\n\nHowever, the officials noted that their staff still have been conducting remote monitoring of all recipients, although \nstaff have not conducted any asset management reviews of grant recipients this year.132 At another HUD field \n\n\n\noffice, an official told us that since the Recovery Act was passed, Recovery Act work has been a top priority for \nHUD nationwide. He noted that other housing work, especially conducting on-site reviews, has been deferred to \nmeet Recovery Act requirements. According to HUD headquarters officials, as a consequence of field office \nmonitoring of Recovery Act requirements, field staff conducted reviews (on-site or remote) of every housing agency \nin the country, something they would not have accomplished in the course of their routine monitoring activities\n\nHUD officials also stated that field staff were able to strengthen housing agency officials' knowledge of contract \nadministration and forge stronger\n\nRecovery Act relationships with a greater number of housing agencies as a result of their Recovery Act oversight\n\nHUD Has Taken Additional Action to Improve Quality of Recipient Reported Data HUD officials told us they have \nbeen using the same quality review procedures for the fourth recipient reporting period as they did for the third \nreporting period. However, HUD also issued additional guidance to recipients to help them more accurately report \njob-related data. Although HUD does not play a direct role in compiling the recipient data, officials noted they \ncontinued to support recipients' report preparation by providing technical assistance, including issuing guidance, \nconducting conference calls, manning a call center, and transmitting regular e-mail correspondence. Officials also \ntold us that their data quality reviews of recipient reports continued to include automated data checks to flag values \nin specific fields that were incorrect or that fell outside of parameters that HUD had defined as reasonable and to \ngenerate comments notifying housing agencies of the potential errors. HUD officials told us that they also have \nbeen using the same processes from the third reporting period for checking for and addressing errors in job-count \ntotals for the fourth reporting period. The officials noted that their on-time reporting rate for the fourth reporting \nperiod was high and their error rate continues to decline with each reporting cycle. We are in the process of \nassessing the transparency of information reported in Recovery.gov for three HUD Recovery Act programs, \nincluding formula grants awarded through the Public Housing Capital Fund program\n\nAs we reported in May 2010, officials with two housing agencies reported using an out-of-date version of HUD's \njobs-counting calculator for the third round reporting period. To ensure that housing agencies use the correct jobs \ncalculation, we recommended that HUD clearly emphasize to housing agencies that they discontinue use of the \noutdated jobs calculator provided by HUD in the first round of recipient reporting. In response to our \nrecommendation, HUD sent an e- mail to housing agencies on June 30, 2010, that explicitly instructed them not to \nuse the outdated jobs-counting calculator, as it was not correctly computing the FTE calculation per updated OMB \nguidance. This e-mail also included a link to HUD's new online jobs-counting calculator and instructed housing \nagencies to use this calculator for the July, and all future, reporting periods\n\nOMB's December 2009 guidance states that to the maximum extent practicable, job information should be collected \nfrom all subrecipients and vendors in order to generate the most comprehensive and complete job impact numbers \navailable. As we reported in May 2010, for the third reporting period, at least one housing agency did not report \njob\n\nRecovery Act 133State housing finance agencies award LIHTCs to owners of qualified rental properties who \nreserve all or a portion of their units for occupancy for low-income tenants. Once awarded LIHTCs, project owners \ntypically attempt to obtain funding for their projects by attracting third-party investors that contribute equity to the \nprojects. These investors can then claim the tax credits for 10 years if the property continues to comply with \nprogram requirements. This arrangement of providing LIHTCs in return for an equity investment is generally \nreferred to as \"selling\" the tax credits. Some project owners sell the LIHTCs to an investor that will invest directly in \nthe LIHTC project while others use a syndicator, which assembles a group of investors and pools funds that are \nthen invested in the LIHTC project\n\nFor purposes of this report we refer to direct investors and syndicators generally as \"third- party investors\"or \n\"investors.\" 134Because many of the affordable housing tax credit projects generate small amounts of cash flow \nfrom rental income, they rely on LIHTC together with other forms of subsidies like the HOME Investment \n\n\n\nPartnerships Program, Community Development Block Grants, and state funds to develop, rehabilitate, and \nadequately maintain projects\n\ninformation for subcontractors even when the subcontractors were providing essential goods and services for \nRecovery Act-funded projects\n\nWe recommended that HUD issue guidance to housing agencies that explains when the prime recipient should \nreport FTEs attributable to subcontractors. In response to our recommendation, HUD notified housing agencies in \na June 30, 2010, e-mail that it had developed additional guidance for housing agencies to use when determining \nwhether prime recipients should report FTEs for subcontractors and provided a link to the guidance on its Web site. \nThe guidance noted that housing agencies should include Recovery Act-funded hours that contractors and \nsubcontractors worked as part of their FTE calculation\n\nHUD and Treasury Continue Making Progress Outlaying TCAP and Section 1602 Program Funds, but \nOpportunities Exist to Improve Plans for Oversight and Meeting Challenging Project Spending Deadlines The \nRecovery Act established two funding programs that provide capital investments to Low-Income Housing Tax Credit \n(LIHTC) projects (1) the Tax Credit Assistance Program (TCAP) administered by HUD and (2) the Grants to States \nfor Low-Income Housing Projects in Lieu of Low-Income Housing Credits Program under Section 1602 of the \nRecovery Act (Section 1602 Program) administered by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).133 Before the \ncredit market was disrupted in 2008, the LIHTC program provided substantial financing in the form of third- party \ninvestor equity for affordable rental housing units.134 As the demand for tax credits declined, so did the prices third-\nparty investors were willing to pay for them, which created funding gaps in projects that had received tax credit \nallocations in 2007 and 2008. TCAP and the Section 1602 Program were designed to fill financing gaps in planned \ntax credit projects and jumpstart stalled projects\n\nRecovery Act 135HUD obligated funds to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The Recovery \nAct directed HUD to distribute TCAP funds in accordance with the fiscal year 2008 HOME Investment Partnerships \nProgram (HOME) formula allocations to state participating jurisdictions, thereby limiting the funds to states as \ndefined by the HOME requirements (HOME formula). Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands are defined as \"insular \nareas\" under HOME, rather than as \"states,\" and therefore, did not receive TCAP funds\n\n136This report uses the terms obligation and outlays when discussing funds that HUD and Treasury provide to \nHFAs. By obligation, we mean that the respective federal agencies have entered into agreements with HFAs for a \nspecified amount of funds. By outlays, we mean that the federal agencies have released funds to an HFA. We use \nthe terms commitments and disbursements to discuss funds provided by HFAs to projects. By commitments, we \nmean the HFA has entered into an agreement to provide funds to a project owner. By disbursement, we mean that \nthe HFAs have released funds to project owners\n\nFor TCAP, the Recovery Act requires HUD to obligate $2.25 billion to 52 housing finance agencies (HFA) for gap \nfinancing of LIHTC projects that included some LIHTCs.135 HFAs had to give priority to projects that were \"shovel \nready\" and expected to be completed by February 2012. HFAs and project owners face three milestones for \ncommitting and disbursing TCAP funds.136 - HFAs had to commit 75 percent of their TCAP awards by February \n16, 2010. According to HUD officials, all HFAs met the February 16, 2010, deadline except for South Carolina \nbecause it did not have enough affordable housing projects that needed TCAP assistance\n\n- The Recovery Act requires that HFAs disburse 75 percent of the TCAP awards by February 16, 2011\n\n- The Recovery Act requires that project owners spend all of their TCAP funds by February 2012 As of the end of \nJuly 2010, HUD had outlayed 32.6 percent (about $733 million) of the TCAP funds, up from 16.5 percent as of April \n30, 2010, that we reported in May (see fig. 28)\n\nRecovery Act Figure 28 HUD Outlays of TCAP Funds, as a Percentage of Total Recovery Act Obligations as of \nApril 30 and July 31, 2010 Although HUD originally made obligations of $2.25 billion to HFAs, HUD officials told us \nthat they have taken back TCAP funds from HFAs that either did not commit 75 percent of funds by February 2010, \n\n\n\ndid not have enough demand for the funds, or both. South Carolina-which did not meet the February deadline and \ndid not have enough demand-returned $13 million of its original $25.4 million TCAP allocation. Alabama, which did \nmeet the deadline, returned $3 million of its original $32 million allocation because it did not have enough demand \nfor TCAP funds and would not be able to use all the funds. (We further discuss why some HFAs were challenged to \nmeet deadlines for TCAP and the Section 1602 Program later in this section.) HUD officials told us that they plan to \nreallocate the $16 million through a competitive process and develop criteria to be issued in a HUD notice this fall. \nHUD officials said they expect only HFAs that have demonstrated program progress to be eligible for consideration \nsince the existing TCAP deadlines for disbursing 75 percent of funds by February 2011 still would apply. HUD \nofficials told us that they heard informally from about 20 HFAs interested in receiving additional TCAP funds\n\nFor the Section 1602 Program, Treasury had obligated $5.5 billion and outlayed about 25.5 percent ($1.4 billion) as \nof July 31, 2010, up from the 13.6 percent outlayed as of April 30, 2010 (see fig. 29)\n\nThis figure shows two pie charts that demonstrate HUD's progress outlaying TCAP funds between April 30, 2010 \nand July 31, 2010. The first pie chart shows that of $2.25 billion TCAP funds obligated, HUD outlayed 16.5 percent \n($317 million) as of April 30, 2010. In contrast, the second pie chart shows that of the $2.25 billion TCAP funds \nobligated, HUD outlayed 32.6 percent ($733 million) as of July 31, 2010\n\nRecovery Act 137Project owners must have, by the close of 2010, spent at least 30 percent of their total adjusted \nbasis on land and depreciable property that is reasonably expected to be part of the low-income housing project\n\nFigure 29 Treasury Outlays of Section 1602 Program Funds as a Percentage of Total Recovery Act Obligations as \nof April 30 and July 31, 2010 Unlike HUD, Treasury has not taken back any funds because the first deadline for the \nHFAs to disburse funds is December 31, 2010. Specifically, under Section 1602 Program rules, HFAs must commit \nthe funding to projects by December 2010 and can continue to disburse funds to awarded projects through \nDecember 31, 2011, provided that the project owners spend at least 30 percent of the eligible project costs by \nDecember 31, 2010.137 HFAs must disburse all Section 1602 Program funds by December 2011, or the funds the \nHFAs have not disbursed must be returned to Treasury. Originally, Treasury's guidance required that HFAs had to \nmake all Section 1602 Program disbursements by December 31, 2010, or return the undisbursed funds to Treasury, \nbut Treasury extended the disbursement deadline to December 31, 2011\n\nIn the six previous Recovery Act reports, we have collected and reported data on programs receiving substantial \nRecovery Act funds in 16 selected states and the District of Columbia. These 16 states and the District of Columbia \ntogether have about 65 percent of the U.S. population and will receive an estimated two-thirds of the TCAP funds \nand about 60 percent of the Section 1602 Program funds. Figure 30 lists the TCAP and Section 1602 This figure \nshows two pie charts that demonstrate Treasury's progress outlaying Section 1602 Program funds between April \n30, 2010 and July 31, 2010. The first pie chart shows that of $5.5 billion Section 1602 Program funds obligated, \nTreasury outlayed 13.6 percent ($742 million) as of April 30, 2010. In contrast, the second pie chart shows that of \nthe $5.5 billion Section 1602 Program funds obligated, Treasury outlayed 25.5 percent ($1.4 billion) as of July 31, \n2010\n\nRecovery Act Program obligations and outlays for the 16 states and the District of Columbia as of July 31, 2010\n\nFigure 30 HUD and Treasury Obligations and Outlays for TCAP and Section 1602 Program for the 16 States and \nthe District of Columbia as of July 31, 2010, Compared to April 30, 2010 According to HUD and Treasury data, \nnearly all the HFAs have made progress in disbursing TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds to project owners. \nFigure 30 shows HUD outlays to HFAs in the 16 selected states and the District of Columbia. Because HFAs must \ndisburse their TCAP and This figure shows the dollars and percentages of funds obligated and outlayed for both \nTCAP and Section 1602 Programs as of July 31, 2010, compared to the percentages of funds outlayed for each \nprogram as of April 30, 2010, based on GAO analysis of HUD and Treasury data\n\nFor TCAP funds, 16 states and Washington, D.C. outlayed 30.8 percent of $1.5049 billion obligated as of July 31, \n2010. These outlays range from 11.4 percent (Texas) to 77.5 percent (Arizona), including three more than 50 \n\n\n\npercent (Arizona; Washington, D.C.; and Iowa). In contrast, none of the states or the District had outlayed more \nthan 50 percent of TCAP funds as of April 30, 2010\n\nFor Section 1602 Program funds, 16 states and Washington, D.C. outlayed 22.0 percent of $3.267 billion obligated \nas of July 31, 2010. These outlays range from 0 percent (Mississippi) to 69.9 percent (North Carolina), including \nthree more than 50 percent (Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania). In contrast, only one state (North Carolina) \nhad outlayed more than 50 percent of Section 1602 Program funds as of April 30, 2010.\n\nRecovery Act 138Unlike TCAP, the Section 1602 Program permits rolling applications through December 31, 2010\n\n139We interviewed a cross-section of HFAs and conducted site visits to selected projects that had received either \nTCAP or Section 1602 Program funds, and interviewed project owners and third-party investors involved with these \nselected projects. The Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Mississippi appendixes in the e-supplement of this \nreport provide information on our site visits (GAO-10-1000SP). We also conducted telephone interviews with the \nHFAs in Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, and Montana\n\nSection 1602 Program funds to project owners within 3 days, these figures would closely track disbursements. As \nshown in figure 30, Arizona, Iowa, and the District of Columbia have drawn down more than 50 percent of their \nTCAP funds, and Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania have drawn down more than 50 percent of their Section \n1602 Program funds as of July 31, 2010. When we reported in May, North Carolina was the only state out of the 16 \nselected states and the District of Columbia to have drawn down more than 50 percent of its funds from one of the \nprograms\n\nHowever, the level of outlays, and therefore HFA spending, continues to vary considerably across the states. We \npreviously reported that the difference in spending across the 16 states and the District of Columbia depended on \nwhen the HFA requested Section 1602 Program funds, the level of construction activity, and the HFA's \nimplementation timeline.138 For example, Treasury officials told us that while 40 HFAs had requested funds by \nSeptember 2009, the Mississippi Home Corporation (MHC) requested funds for the first time in February 2010. \nAccording to Treasury officials, Treasury outlayed funds to MHC for the first time on August 12, 2010. MHC officials \ntold us that they expect to close on most of their projects in August and September 2010, which is when MHC will \nsign agreements with project owners that will meet HFA requirements to begin disbursing funds\n\nTCAP and the Section 1602 Program Have Had a Strong Impact on the LIHTC Market HFA officials, project \nowners, and third-party investors that we interviewed generally agreed that TCAP and the Section 1602 Program \nprovided funds to many stalled LIHTC projects and enabled them to move forward.139 For example, some owners \nof stalled projects said that their projects could not have continued without TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds. \nTCAP and Section 1602 Program funds also made some rural projects and special needs population projects-such \nas farm worker housing, housing for formerly homeless, and housing for the disabled- more feasible and attractive \nto third-party investors. Officials from one HFA we interviewed told us that investors scrutinize the financial outlook\n\nRecovery Act for rural projects because they expect that the income for these projects will be tight or non-existent. \nHFAs, project owners, and investors also told us that in a difficult market, investors are less likely to risk \ninvestments in these types of projects. We interviewed nine HFAs that awarded financing to 385 projects-154 (40 \npercent) were rural and 37 (10 percent) were special needs population projects-which may not have moved forward \nwithout the assistance of the TCAP and Section 1602 Program\n\nLIHTC projects that received TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds typically had less investor equity than LIHTC \nprojects had prior to the economic downturn. The decrease in investor equity varied for each project and by state. \nThe nine HFAs that we interviewed reported that equity in LIHTC projects prior to the economic downturn generally \nranged from 50 to 80 percent of the total financing for a project. In contrast, for projects receiving TCAP and Section \n1602 Program funds from the nine HFAs that we interviewed, investor equity represents on average 43 percent of a \nproject's overall financing. For LIHTC projects receiving TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds, the decrease in \ninvestor equity has been offset by the increase in federal funds\n\n\n\nSome HFA officials, project owners, and third-party investors that we interviewed currently believe that demand for \nLIHTCs is re- emerging since the credit markets were severely disrupted in 2008. However, some of them said that \nthird-party investor demand still was not at a level where most projects were feasible. Investor demand and tax \ncredit prices have been picking up in some states and regions more than others. According to some investors with \nwhom we spoke, investor demand and tax credit prices tended to be higher on the coasts than in the middle of the \ncountry\n\nInvestors also preferred certain types of projects, such as those that were larger, located in urban areas, and \ncatered to seniors. Projects that were smaller, located in rural areas, and targeted special needs populations more \noften lacked third-party investors\n\nSince the economic downturn, the composition of third-party investors also has changed. First, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, which according to an investor, had bought the largest share of tax credits (40 percent in 2006) and \nwere the primary third-party investors in special population projects, exited the marketplace. Second, according to \nanother investor, the low tax credit prices have resulted in higher yields that in turn have attracted \"yield-driven\" \ninvestors, including insurance companies, large\n\nRecovery Act 140The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is intended to encourage institutions that accept \ndeposits, such as banks, to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. CRA requires \nregulators to evaluate periodically each insured depository institution's record in helping meet the credit needs of its \nentire community. That record is taken into account in considering an institution's application for deposit facilities, \nincluding mergers and acquisitions. Investing in LIHTC projects allows banks to earn positive consideration toward \ntheir regulatory ratings under CRA\n\ncorporations, and individuals. Banks, which had invested in the tax credit markets primarily because of Community \nReinvestment Act requirements, have continued to do so.140 However, if tax credit prices continue to rise, yields \nwill decrease, which may cause \"yield- driven\" investors to exit the market\n\nBecause the LIHTC market is still rebounding and some states continue to face challenges attracting investors, the \nmajority of HFAs that we interviewed support temporarily extending the Section 1602 Program. If the Section 1602 \nProgram were not extended, some project owners anticipated scaling back development activities and being more \nselective about which projects they develop. Some HFAs and project owners who supported the extension of the \nSection 1602 Program believe the funds would be most useful if used to fill financing gaps, to fund rural and special \nneeds population projects, and to provide grants or funds to nonprofits that are developing projects that target such \nneeds\n\nSome HFAs and Projects May Face Challenges in Meeting HUD and Treasury Deadlines for Using Funds Some \nHFAs and projects may face challenges in meeting TCAP and Section 1602 Program deadlines for reasons ranging \nfrom increased workload to the time needed to assemble financing to construction delays\n\nSome HFAs reported that the addition of TCAP and Section 1602 Program transactions this year has increased \ntheir workloads significantly. One HFA reported that it typically closed from 18 to 22 projects annually, but this year \nwould close 60 projects. Two other HFAs reported that they typically closed from 8 to 15 projects annually, but \nexpected to close 50 and 85 projects this year, respectively\n\nMost HFAs Likely Will Meet TCAP Deadlines, but Those That Have Delayed Disbursing TCAP Funds May Face \nChallenges For TCAP, the potential challenges HFAs face appear to be related to how they structured the timing of \nthe TCAP disbursements. According to HUD officials, it is difficult to determine which states may have difficulty \nmeeting TCAP spending deadlines because states took different\n\nRecovery Act 141According to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, the litigation involves three projects for \nwhich the owners disagreed with the HFA's decision to rescind provisional awards based on an unfavorable credit \nunderwriting review\n\n\n\napproaches to awarding funds. A few HFAs may be at a disadvantage in terms of meeting 2011 and 2012 \ndeadlines because they chose to award TCAP funds late in the development process to ensure that commitments \nfrom other financing sources are in place and the projects will be successfully completed. As a result, these HFAs \nhave disbursed a small percentage of their TCAP funds to date. The HFA officials we interviewed in nine states did \nnot believe the TCAP disbursement deadline was a challenge for their projects\n\nTreasury Plans for Ensuring That Section 1602 Program Projects Meet Spending Deadlines Remain Unclear \nAccording to some HFA officials, some project owners may face challenges meeting the 30 percent spending \ndeadline (December 31, 2010) for Section 1602 Program projects, due to reasons that affected some projects \nallocated Section 1602 Program or TCAP funds, ranging from the timing needed to assemble or disburse funding \nby HFAs, litigation, and routine construction delays. According to HFA officials with whom we spoke, some projects \nneeded to wait for FHA mortgage insurance approval or approval from other sources of subsidies before receiving \nfinal HFA approval. Officials from one HFA with whom we spoke said that while all their Section 1602 Program \nprojects were shovel-ready, getting all parties educated and comfortable about the requirements of the new \nprogram took time. Some projects had been stalled for months, and it took time to \"ramp up\" all parties engaged in \nthe projects. In addition, some projects encountered delays during the construction process due to weather or other \nissues typical of development projects such as waiting for construction permits from local agencies. Other projects \nwere delayed due to legal issues unrelated to the Section 1602 Program. For example, Florida Housing Finance \nCorporation officials told us that as of August 2010, about $22.3 million in Section 1602 Program funds were \nallocated to projects involved in litigation.141 Furthermore, in HFAs that delayed the decision to participate in the \nSection 1602 Program or that had a slow start to launching the Section 1602 Program projects have collectively had \nless time to spend eligible funds than in other states where funds were awarded earlier. For example,\n\nRecovery Act 142MHC's board delayed its request for Section 1602 Program funds to Treasury until February 2010 \nwhile it assessed program risks related to Treasury's requirements for recapture of funds. MHC is responsible for \nreturning Section 1602 Program funds to Treasury if a project owner fails to complete the project or meet LIHTC \nrequirements. GAO reported previously on the risks and responsibilities of recapture for HFAs under TCAP and the \nSection 1602 Program. See GAO, States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address \nImplementation Challenges and Bolster Accountability, GAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C. May 26, 2010)\n\nthe MHC did not request Section 1602 Program funds from Treasury until February 2010.142 MHC told us that it is \nconcerned that each of its 17 projects receiving Section 1602 Program funds may not meet the 30 percent spending \ndeadline. One HFA said that a typical LIHTC project would take about 15 months from applying for funds to closing \nthe project and commencing construction. Our review of projects in nine states shows that these HFAs had not yet \nawarded Section 1602 Program funds to 75 projects as of June 30, 2010. Further, as of June 30, 2010, about 39 \npercent of Section 1602 Program projects (98 of 252 projects) that have been awarded funds in these nine states \nhave not yet closed, which is the first step to being able to draw funds from entities that provide financing\n\nTreasury initially required HFAs to return all Section 1602 Program funds not disbursed by December 31, 2010. In a \nregulation of August 31, 2009, Treasury extended the deadline for disbursing Section 1602 Program funds by 1 \nyear, provided project owners met the 30 percent spending requirement. Treasury had determined that completion \nof projects by December 31, 2010, was too restrictive and would preclude funding of otherwise eligible projects. \nTreasury officials told us that the new 30 percent requirement was put in place to assure that project owners were \nmaking some progress by the original (December 31, 2010) deadline date\n\nMissing the deadline for the 30 percent spending requirement could have significant implications for the viability of \nSection 1602 Program projects\n\nIf project owners failed to meet this spending deadline, they would not be eligible to receive any additional Section \n1602 Program funds. If prevented from receiving the rest of their Section 1602 Program award, project owners \nmight not be able to find replacement financing and committed financing sources might withdraw their funds. If \nprojects could not secure replacement financing quickly, they would be unlikely to be completed in accordance with \nSection 1602 Program and LIHTC requirements and would be stalled again. Under such a scenario, the HFA would \n\n\n\nbe responsible for recapturing any Section 1602 Program funds that were disbursed to the project prior to the 30 \npercent spending deadline\n\nRecovery Act 143Asset management includes many activities that relate to monitoring and planning for the long-\nterm financial and physical health and viability of a project. Some examples of asset management are discussed in \nthis section\n\nTreasury officials told us that they plan to enforce the deadline requirement, and would provide written guidance to \nHFAs that will describe the kind and format of information to be reported to Treasury to document whether projects \nhave met the spending deadline. Treasury officials told us that they do not plan to collect this information until after \nthe deadline has passed. Without a plan in place for handling projects that do not meet the Section 1602 Program \ndeadline, Treasury risks further project interruptions, including the possible loss of any job creation associated with \nprojects that must be discontinued if alternate financing cannot be found\n\nTCAP and the Section 1602 Program Impose More Oversight Responsibilities on HFAs Than the LIHTC Program \nAlone, and HFAs Have Developed Approaches for Such Oversight TCAP and the Section 1602 Program require \nHFAs to assume a greater project oversight role than in the standard LIHTC program. Under the LIHTC program, \nHFAs need not monitor construction disbursements, but must report that projects are completed and occupied in \naccordance with LIHTC requirements and deadlines. For long-term monitoring under the LIHTC program, third- \nparty investors in the project perform long-term asset management, and HFAs perform limited compliance \nreviews.143 - HFAs must review LIHTC projects at least annually to determine project owner compliance with \ntenant qualifications and rent and income limits\n\n- Additionally, every 3 years the HFAs must conduct on-site inspections of all buildings in each LIHTC project and \ninspect at least 20 percent of the LIHTC units and resident files associated with those units\n\nHowever, under TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, HFAs must monitor the disbursement and use of funds \nthroughout the construction period\n\nHFAs also must perform long-term asset management, which imposes ongoing responsibilities on the HFAs for the \nviability of each project\n\n- An HFA's asset management activities may include monitoring current financial and physical aspects of project \noperations. For example, an HFA may perform analyses or approvals of operating budgets, cash flow trends, and \nreserve accounts and conduct physical inspections more frequently than every 3 years Recovery Act 144In \ncontrast, under the conventional LIHTC program, HFAs are not liable for recapturing funds if a project owner fails to \ncomply with LIHTC requirements. Rather, their obligation is to report any noncompliance to the IRS, and the IRS \ntakes any further actions with respect to recapture. GAO reported previously on the risks and responsibilities of \nrecapture for HFAs under TCAP and the Section 1602 Program. See GAO-10-604\n\n145We conducted a Web-based survey in November 2009 of all 54 HFAs that received TCAP and Section 1602 \nProgram funds as of that date. All HFAs responded. For a copy of the survey and the compiled HFA responses, see \nGAO-10-1023SP\n\n- Asset management activities also examine long-term issues related to plans for addressing a project's capital \nneeds, changes in market conditions, and recommendations and implementation of plans to correct troubled \nprojects\n\n- HFAs also ensure compliance with LIHTC requirements as part of their asset- management activities\n\nMoreover, HFAs are responsible for returning TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds to HUD and Treasury, \nrespectively, if a project fails to comply with LIHTC requirements.144 Given the increase in responsibilities and risks \nto HFAs, HFAs have developed approaches for oversight during the construction period as well as long-term asset \n\n\n\nmanagement over the 15-year tax credit compliance period. These approaches are designed to monitor the \nphysical and financial health of projects and compliance with LIHTC affordability restrictions\n\nIn response to an open-ended question in our survey asking about what changes in oversight activities HFAs \nplanned to put in place to assure compliance with the TCAP and Section 1602 Program, 37 HFAs said they would \nmake some changes in oversight activities, 11 said they would make no changes in oversight activities, and 6 said \nthey were not sure what changes they would make or they did not answer the question.145 Changes in activities \nvaried across HFAs. For example, of the 37 HFAs that said they would make some changes, 13 HFAs noted that \nthey would make changes to their disbursement process to more closely track the use of TCAP and Section 1602 \nProgram funds, 9 HFAs said they would increase overall monitoring of projects or reporting required by project \nowners, and 7 HFAs planned to implement or increase the frequency of site visits or inspections. Eleven HFAs said \nthey would not change their oversight activities, but 6 of those 11 HFAs noted that they would rely on their\n\nRecovery Act 146The Recovery Act expressly applies section 288 of the HOME statute, which requires the state to \nassume responsibility for environmental review under NEPA and related federal environmental authorities and \nregulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 58 \"Environmental Review Procedures for Entities Assuming HUD Environmental \nResponsibilities.\" In addition, under section 1606 of Division A of the Recovery Act, contractors and subcontractors \nhired with Recovery Act funds are required to pay prevailing wages to laborers and mechanics in compliance with \nthe Davis-Bacon Act\n\nexperience in and established procedures for monitoring their lending programs or disbursement of other federal \nfunds\n\nHFAs Have Increased Oversight during Construction Phase of TCAP and Section 1602 Program Projects HFAs \nhave been providing greater oversight during the construction period for projects that receive TCAP and Section \n1602 Program funds\n\nThis oversight includes monitoring disbursements of the program funds, overseeing the construction process, and \nensuring compliance by TCAP projects with federal cross-cutting requirements such as Davis- Bacon wage \nrequirements and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).146 For example, HFAs must review \npayrolls for all TCAP projects to ensure that project owners and contractors are paying prevailing wages to \nindividuals employed in the construction of the projects. HFAs also had to ensure that all TCAP projects complied \nwith the NEPA environmental review process prior to receiving any TCAP funds. However, according to HUD \nofficials, up to one-third of HFAs lacked prior experience in overseeing compliance with these federal cross-cutting \nrequirements\n\nUnder TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, HFAs have been disbursing a greater volume of funds than in the past \nand, as a result, have taken additional steps to limit risk and increase monitoring. For example, one HFA we \ninterviewed expected to disburse the same amount of funds in 1 month as it previously disbursed annually. For \nstandard LIHTC projects, HFAs only allocate tax credits and do not disburse funds. HFAs assume greater risk by \ndisbursing TCAP and Section 1602 Program funds because they are responsible for repaying funds to HUD and \nTreasury, respectively, in the event of noncompliance. The nine HFAs we interviewed are supporting an average of \n23 to 62 percent of the total development costs of projects through awards of TCAP or Section 1602 Program \nfunds. Prior to the Recovery Act, three of these HFAs typically did not provide loans or grants to LIHTC projects, but \nnow they are providing an average of 23 to 47 percent of total project financing through TCAP and Section 1602\n\nRecovery Act 147HOME, administered by HUD, provides formula grants to states and localities that communities \nuse-often in partnership with local nonprofit groups-to fund a wide range of activities that build, buy, or rehabilitate \naffordable housing for rent or homeownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income people\n\nProgram project awards. The remaining six HFAs typically funded up to about 33 percent of the total project \nfinancing for some LIHTC projects through other loan programs prior to the Recovery Act. HFAs have mitigated \nrisks by broadening the scope of guarantees and by requiring project owners to certify the accuracy of the \ninformation provided\n\n\n\nApproaches to overseeing the construction process varied across HFAs, although most HFAs we interviewed \nplanned to apply their existing construction oversight framework to oversee TCAP and Section 1602 Program \nprojects. These activities include site inspections of varying frequency. For example, some HFAs we interviewed \nplanned to conduct monthly site inspections, while two HFAs said that construction superintendents would visit \nproject sites twice per month or more frequently if needed. Site inspections help confirm whether work performed on \na project is carried out as planned and approved by the HFA. One HFA also told us that it planned to facilitate \ncommunication among project owners, investors, and other lenders by sharing information or holding more frequent \nmeetings with these stakeholders\n\nHFAs and project owners told us that meeting Davis-Bacon wage reporting and NEPA environmental review \nrequirements for TCAP projects required time and resources, and it was easier for HFAs with prior experience to \nmeet the requirements. We previously reported that HFAs viewed Davis- Bacon and NEPA requirements as a \nchallenge and followed up with HFAs and project owners on ways that they have been meeting the requirements\n\nTo comply with Davis-Bacon wage requirements, some HFAs developed new processes for data collection and \nplanned to apply additional scrutiny to data received from project owners or more frequent reporting, and other \nHFAs developed training for project owners. To comply with NEPA requirements, some HFAs and project owners \ndrew upon their experience administering HOME funds, which also require NEPA compliance.147 Project owners \nsaid that in some cases they allocated additional resources to projects to complete environmental reviews ahead of \nproject closings\n\nRecovery Act In Response to New Asset Management Responsibilities, HFAs Have Increased Long-Term \nMonitoring and Put in Place Stricter Requirements for Project Owners In response to the new asset management \nresponsibilities HFAs have accepted under TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, all HFAs we interviewed \nreported that they had strengthened their procedures for long- term monitoring to meet the program requirements, \nmitigate risks, and help ensure projects' long-term physical and financial viability\n\nApproaches to long-term asset management varied depending on an HFA's resources, workload, and asset \nmanagement experience. However, all nine of the HFAs we interviewed have implemented some oversight \nchanges, such as increasing the number of inspection visits over the 15-year tax credit compliance period and the \nfrequency of reporting, as well as enhancing financial monitoring of projects receiving TCAP and Section 1602 \nProgram funds when compared with standard LIHTC projects\n\nOf the nine HFAs we interviewed, four HFAs said that instead of inspecting projects every 3 years as required by \nthe LIHTC program, they will inspect projects annually or more often. Seven HFAs said that they will require \nreports from project owners on a monthly, quarterly, or as- requested basis that may include information such as \nproject income statements. Five of the nine HFAs we interviewed have the ability to approve and remove the \nproject's management agent and general partner of the project owner if the project is in noncompliance with LIHTC \nrequirements or the terms of the HFA's agreement with the project owner\n\nTwo HFAs said that they have new software systems in place to manage asset management activities, and four \nsaid they plan to provide additional training for staff to manage the monitoring and reporting for TCAP and Section \n1602 Program projects. HFAs said that they have also strengthened financial requirements for project owners. All \nnine HFAs require annual financial audits or reports. Other changes HFAs have made include requiring or \nperforming capital needs assessments to determine the condition and expected life of the physical infrastructure, \ncalculating replacement costs, and assessing whether a project's replacement reserve will be adequate to meet the \nexpected capital needs of a project. Some HFAs also require project owners to provide guaranties that the project \nowner will ensure compliance with program requirements or the project owner will be personally liable to repay \nTCAP and Section 1602 Program funds to the HFA. Some HFAs also have strengthened requirements for financial \nreserves or changed how and when the reserves can be accessed to ensure that there is a source of funds to draw \nupon in the event the project encounters operating difficulties. Some project owners with whom\n\n\n\nRecovery Act 148These data do not include projects financed with a combination of Section 1602 Program funds \nand TCAP funds\n\nwe spoke said that HFAs have been careful in structuring requirements to protect the HFAs' interests and that in \nsome cases the HFAs' requirements and plans for monitoring were stricter than those typically required by third-\nparty investors\n\nNearly all HFAs we interviewed noted that a third-party investor provides additional oversight and monitoring or \nfinancial interest in a project. TCAP requires tax credits to remain in transactions, and project owners typically sell \nthe tax credits to third-party investors. Therefore, most TCAP projects have some level of private investment and \noversight. In contrast, the Section 1602 Program allows HFAs to exchange all of the tax credits awarded to a \nproject in return for Section 1602 Program funds. As a result, many Section 1602 Program projects do not have \nthird-party investor oversight. However, some HFAs have required third-party investor participation in all or the \nmajority of their Section 1602 Program projects, and they plan to work in coordination with investors on asset \nmanagement activities. Based on information from our survey, 32 HFAs expected to have a total of 485 projects \nwithout third-party investors out of a total of 825 projects expected to be financed with Section 1602 Program \nfunds.148 In our survey, about half of the HFAs planned to outsource asset management functions for TCAP and \nthe Section 1602 Program. Based on our interviews with nine HFAs, we found that HFAs with past asset \nmanagement experience and HFAs with a smaller volume of projects often chose to conduct their own asset \nmanagement activities over the 15- year compliance period. In contrast, HFAs with little asset management \nexperience or many projects requiring oversight often chose to hire a third-party contractor to perform asset \nmanagement activities. However, one HFA in each of these categories chose to work in coordination with individual \ninvestors on asset management activities rather than relying solely on its own asset management efforts or the \nwork of outsourced asset managers\n\nFive of the nine HFAs we interviewed are conducting their own asset management activities because they have \nsignificant experience managing loan portfolios or because the number of projects is manageable. One HFA we \ninterviewed has 35 years of asset management experience, and two have 20 years of asset management \nexperience. One of these HFAs also conducts asset management for HUD's performance- based contract\n\nRecovery Act 149This HFA told us that it did not have asset management experience and chose to outsource asset \nmanagement on projects that did not have investor participation (6 projects) and coordinate with investors on \nprojects that have investor participation (74 projects). The other HFA we interviewed that has hired an outside asset \nmanager has a large volume of projects (89 projects) and will use the outside services to supplement its own \nfinancial monitoring of projects. Two HFAs we interviewed have required investor participation in all transactions, \nand they said they will coordinate with investors to ensure asset management is performed on all projects\n\nadministration program and has won awards for its asset management systems. Six HFAs we interviewed said they \nhave or are developing policies, procedures, or \"watch lists\" to assess project performance and identify projects that \nmay be in need of additional monitoring\n\nOne of the two HFAs we interviewed planning to outsource asset management activities has contracted with a \nnational syndicator to provide asset management for its projects without private investment.149 The syndicator has \nsaid that it will provide the same asset management services to the HFA as it would provide to investors in its \nLIHTC investment funds. The HFA has a staff person that is receiving an asset management certification and will \nwork closely with the syndicator to ensure that asset management functions are performed in accordance with the \nsyndicator's scope of work. The syndicator's scope of work covers both the leasing and asset management phases \nand includes activities such as providing quarterly project performance reports that rate the risk of the project \nbased on market conditions and project owner capacity, conducting annual property inspections, and performing \nannual long-term financial analysis. The syndicator said that it helped the HFA structure a more comprehensive \nscope of work because it felt that the asset management activities started too late to ensure project success\n\n\n\nHFAs noted a range of challenges associated with asset management. One HFA we interviewed said that \nexplaining the HFA's new asset management role to developers has been a challenge because the HFA does not \nusually act as a lender or party with long-term interests in the projects. Rather, the agency's primary role is that of \ntax credit allocation with compliance monitoring as required by IRS. HFAs also noted the cost of asset management \nas a challenge. A few HFAs are charging low or no fees for asset management because of the stress the fee puts \non the project budgets. Other HFAs have estimated a fee based on market research and costs associated with their \ncurrent operations, but they are not sure the fee will be sufficient to cover costs. Most HFAs we interviewed \nestimated that their initial asset management costs would be highest during the first\n\nRecovery Act years implementing TCAP and the Section 1602 Program, including the initial construction monitoring \nperiod. For example, one HFA estimated that 20 - 30 percent of its asset management costs would be incurred \nwithin the first 2 years of overseeing TCAP and Section 1602 Program projects. However, some HFAs and \ninvestors noted future challenges as projects age. They said that between the fifth to twelfth year of a project's life, \nprojects may begin to show signs of physical and financial stress due to capital replacement needs, diminishing \nreserves, or resident turnover\n\nOne investor said that HFAs may not have the financial resources to support troubled projects in the same way as \nan investor would\n\nHUD Strategy for Monitoring TCAP Does Not Fully Consider Project Risks HUD officials told us that the agency has \nbeen relying on existing monitoring systems to determine whether funds have been spent properly or to track \nprojects that have not been complying with the terms and conditions of TCAP agreements. The monitoring systems \nconsist of HUD Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits (thus far ongoing in three states), HUD Office of Fair \nHousing and Equal Opportunity (OFHEO) reviews in 10 states, HOME reviews done by HUD field offices when \nprojects include both TCAP and HOME funds, and HFA reviews. HUD officials told us that they can rely on existing \nOffice of Community Planning and Development (CPD) field staff to carry out HUD's monitoring and also would \nplan to look for patterns of problems identified by the OIG, OFHEO, CPD staff, or HFAs during oversight and review \nactivities. HUD officials noted that the agency's emphasis so far has been on the obligation, outlay, and tracking of \nfunds to the HFAs and their disbursement to project owners\n\nAs well as HFAs, HUD officials also expect that third-party investors will monitor TCAP projects for compliance in \nthe same way that these stakeholders have been responsible for monitoring LIHTC projects. TCAP requires tax \ncredits to remain in transactions, and project owners typically sell the tax credits to third-party investors. However, \nwe found that in some cases projects included a limited amount of LIHTCs and project owners chose not to sell \nthese credits to a third-party, thereby limiting or precluding third-party oversight of these projects. In traditional \nLIHTC projects, third- party investors play an important role in ensuring compliance with tax credit program \nrequirements because they risk losing their ability to claim the tax credits if the project is not in compliance with \nthese requirements. Some HFAs told us that they will coordinate with and rely on reviews and audits that investors \nand private construction lenders\n\nRecovery Act 150Some HFAs are coordinating with and relying on reviews and audits that investors and private \nconstruction lenders perform in order to satisfy the HFAs' asset management obligations under the Section 1602 \nProgram as well\n\n151FHFC officials said they set $650 as the required equity investment for these projects by using the average \nmarket price for LIHTCs in Florida at the time of the TCAP award, which was 65 cents per dollar of tax credits. \nBecause LIHTCs are claimed over a ten-year period, the total equity investment for $100 of tax credits priced at 65 \ncents is $650\n\n152See the Florida appendix in the e-supplement of this report for a description of FHFC's activities (GAO-10-\n1000SP)\n\nIn cases when an HFA is coordinating with a third-party investor, the investor may provide early warning information \nthat would be useful to the HFA if the HFA had to act quickly to assist the project or ensure compliance with TCAP \n\n\n\nrequirements. But, some TCAP projects received a nominal amount of tax credits, and project owners chose not to \nsell the tax credits. These projects lack the additional oversight provided by third- party investors. In these cases, \nHFAs may be the sole monitor, other than HUD, ensuring that funds are spent properly and that the project owners \ncomply with TCAP terms and conditions\n\nperform to satisfy the HFAs' asset management obligations under TCAP.150 HUD officials acknowledged that in \nthe absence of a significant third- party investment, the amount of overall scrutiny a TCAP project would receive is \nreduced; however, HUD officials told us that at this point in time they were not aware of how many projects either \nhad nominal LIHTC awards or lacked third-party investors. Our limited review showed that some TCAP projects in \nFlorida received a nominal amount of tax credits and lacked third-party investors that otherwise would provide an \nadded layer of oversight for compliance with TCAP requirements. Specifically, we found that 13 of 25 projects (52 \npercent) that were allocated TCAP funds in Florida had received a nominal amount of LIHTCs. The Florida Housing \nFinance Corporation (FHFC) explained that it had awarded $100 in LIHTCs to each of these projects and that the \nproject owners made $650 equity investments to the projects in return for the tax credit awards instead of selling the \ntax credits to a third-party investor.151 FHFC plans to institute oversight activities for all of its TCAP and Section \n1602 Program projects.152 Nonetheless, HUD has not required HFAs to enhance their oversight or take other \nactions to account for the absence or limited involvement of third-party investors. Without the oversight provided by \nthird-party investors and with the limited monitoring planned by HUD, these TCAP projects may constitute a higher \nrisk to HUD and to the HFAs\n\nRecovery Act that they will become troubled or fall out of compliance with LIHTC requirements\n\nIn addition, although HUD's monitoring strategy relies partly on monitoring by third-party investors and HOME \nprogram reviews, HUD officials told us that they will not know how many TCAP projects have third-party investors \nor how many also have HOME funds until projects are completed and HFAs submit final reports on the projects. \nTherefore, HUD cannot currently determine the number of projects that are being monitored by others. Additionally, \nHUD does not currently know how many TCAP projects will be covered through HOME reviews. According to HUD \nofficials, once projects are complete and all project information has been reported to HUD, it plans to use that \ninformation to tailor a monitoring plan to these projects. It will be important for HUD's TCAP monitoring strategy to \nrecognize the differences in risk for projects without third-party investor oversight and those with investor oversight \nas well as those projects not covered by HOME reviews\n\nAs discussed above, HUD officials said they have been focused on getting Recovery Act funds to HFAs. Since \nbeginning TCAP, HUD has drawn upon limited staff resources in headquarters to administer and track the spending \nof TCAP funds-its Office of Affordable Housing Programs administers TCAP, and four existing headquarters staff \nfrom the HOME program work on TCAP (three part-time and one full-time). HUD officials noted that the Recovery \nAct does not set aside administrative resources to HUD to either implement the TCAP program, which was \nperformed by existing HOME program staff, or to monitoring HFAs for compliance. In comparison, the Recovery Act \nprovided additional resources for monitoring under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which HUD's CPD also \nperforms\n\nWithout a plan for identifying projects without third-party investor oversight and ensuring sufficient oversight when \ninvestors are absent, HUD will face constraints in ensuring that TCAP projects remain in compliance with program \nrequirements, some of which apply for 15 years or more. Furthermore, without knowing whether projects involve \nthird- party investors, HUD cannot focus its limited monitoring resources on the projects with the least oversight by \nothers\n\nTreasury Developed a Risk- Based System for Monitoring HFAs Unlike HUD, which relies on existing program \noversight resources, Treasury has developed a system to conduct compliance reviews to ensure that the HFAs are \nfollowing the terms and conditions of the Section 1602 Program agreement, and are providing oversight over the \nproject owners\n\n\n\nRecovery Act receiving the awards. Treasury officials told us that their Office of Fiscal Assistant Secretary received \n$3 million to administer the Section 1602 Program and the Section 1603 Renewable Energy Program from the total \nfunds appropriated to Treasury for administrative expenses under the Recovery Act. According to Treasury officials, \nthey have designed a risk- based system in which they plan to conduct compliance monitoring on- site for 23 HFAs \nand remote monitoring for the remainder of the HFAs by the end of calendar year 2010. Whether monitoring is \nconducted on- site or remotely depends on factors such as identified risks and the size of the grant. The review \ngenerally consists of an interview, followed by a review of program files, a review of a sample of project files, a \nreview of financial management information, and a cross-check to the records held at Treasury. After the review is \ncompleted, if there are any findings, staff request a corrective action or action plan, depending on the nature and \nseverity of the noncompliance. According to Treasury officials, if staff recommend a corrective action or action plan, \nTreasury will follow up to ensure that the HFA takes the necessary corrective action. If the agency fails to take the \ncorrective action, Treasury will take steps to bring the HFA into compliance and, if necessary, recapture funds\n\nAs of August 2010, Treasury officials told us that they had completed nine compliance monitoring reviews and have \nbeen conducting six additional HFA reviews. Treasury officials said that the kinds of issues they found in their \nreviews relate to failure to properly document files, lack of a policy to handle fraud by project owners, and, in one \ncase, unresponsiveness to Treasury's request for documentation. Treasury officials told us that these issues were \noften resolved during the compliance review, but that some issues required additional follow-up with the HFAs. In \nthe case of the unresponsive HFA, Treasury officials said they have put a hold on the HFA's Section 1602 Program \nfunds until they are sure the HFA has provided all materials required to satisfy Treasury's requests\n\nTCAP Reporting Requirements Have Been More Complex Than Section 1602 Program Requirements Recovery \nAct recipient reporting requirements are different and more complex for TCAP than for the Section 1602 Program. \nMore specifically, the Recovery Act describes recipient reporting requirements, including that of estimated jobs \ncreated and retained\n\nThe Recovery Act recipient reporting requirements apply only to programs under Division A of the Recovery Act, \nwhich includes TCAP. The Section 1602 Program is under Division B of the Recovery Act, and, therefore, not \nsubject to recipient reporting requirements\n\nRecovery Act 153See GAO-10-604\n\nAs Recovery Act-funded recipients, HFAs must file quarterly reports through FederalReporting.gov on a number of \ndata elements, including the number of full-time equivalent jobs funded by TCAP funds during that quarter. Jobs \nmust be counted in accordance with methodology provided by OMB. OMB guidance limits the number of jobs \nreported to the actual use of the funds in each quarter. In cases of construction funding based on a mix of financing \nsources, HFAs can count the jobs created or retained based on the proportion of TCAP funds. In addition to \nreporting through FederalReporting.gov, HFAs report information on TCAP projects through two HUD systems. \nHFAs use HUD's Integrated Disbursement and Information System to report on the selection of TCAP projects by \nHFAs as well as disbursement of TCAP funds. HFAs also use the Recovery Act Management and Performance \nSystem to report on project compliance with environmental reviews\n\nAlthough not subject to recipient reporting, Treasury chose to collect project information through quarterly \nperformance reports submitted by HFAs on an Excel spreadsheet. HFAs need only make one report of all jobs \ncreated or retained by Section 1602 Program funds for each project\n\nHFAs submit estimated information on the number of FTE jobs to be created or retained by the entire project with \nthe first quarterly report for each project. The number of jobs reported to Treasury need not be reduced to reflect \nparts of the project not funded under the Section 1602 Program. Except for requiring the use of FTEs, Treasury has \nnot issued detailed guidance specifying job estimation methodology under the Section 1602 Program\n\nJob counts between the programs and across HFAs are not comparable\n\n\n\nAbout two-thirds of the HFAs in our survey said that they will conduct a review of the information being provided by \nthe project owners, but others said that they relied on signed statements from the project owners attesting to the \naccuracy of the jobs estimates. Furthermore, because of the differences in job reporting methodology for TCAP \nand the Section 1602 Program, job counts reported for the programs varied widely. We previously reported that \nsome HFAs were concerned about underreporting jobs that TCAP funds created because of OMB's requirement \nthat they count only jobs directly funded by TCAP.153 They said that because projects funded under TCAP would \nnot have moved forward without TCAP funds, all the jobs associated with the projects\n\nRecovery Act should be counted. For example, $2 million in TCAP funds could enable an $8 million project to be \nconstructed that otherwise would not have been built, but only the jobs directly related to the $2 million TCAP \nexpenditure would be reported\n\nConclusions Although constrained by limited resources or time, HUD and Treasury developed two new programs, \nTCAP and the Section 1602 Program, respectively, that are designed to provide capital investment to LIHTC \nprojects hit hard by the economic crisis. TCAP and the Section 1602 Program have had a strong impact on the \nLIHTC market. However, our review identified two areas of concern one that relates to HUD's identification of \nhigher-risk TCAP projects and another that relates to challenges that some project owners may face in meeting a \nDecember 2010 deadline for spending funds in Treasury's Section 1602 Program\n\nUnder TCAP, HFAs have increased responsibilities for asset management and monitoring compliance of project \nowners with the terms and conditions of the program. However, some projects with a nominal amount of tax credits \nmay lack the benefit of oversight by third-party investors. Nonetheless, HUD has not identified projects that lack this \nadditional level of oversight and thus may be at higher risk of noncompliance with TCAP and LIHTC requirements. \nAlthough HUD relies in part on HFAs to provide oversight, HUD does not know the extent to which the HFAs will \nprovide additional oversight for projects that lack third-party investors. HUD is relying on existing monitoring \nsystems and resources, but has not fully identified those projects that may be subject to review under its existing \nsystem (such as TCAP projects that also have HOME funds) or developed additional guidance or oversight of \nTCAP projects where there is little or no third-party oversight. HUD could take a more active role in monitoring \nTCAP projects-first by identifying those projects that may present a higher risk of noncompliance, and second by \nidentifying those projects that also have HOME funds. HUD could also more effectively use limited oversight \nresources by using a risk-based approach that considers whether a TCAP project has third-party investors and \nwhether HFAs are providing enhanced oversight. Likewise, by gathering information about the number of the \nprojects that have TCAP and HOME funding, HUD could more effectively plan reviews and deploy staff. Without a \nmore rigorous approach to oversight, HUD will be limited in its efforts to ensure that TCAP projects meet program \nrequirements and continue to provide a source of affordable housing\n\nTreasury's regulations require project owners to spend 30 percent of eligible project costs by December 31, 2010, \nto continue receiving\n\nRecovery Act additional Section 1602 Program funds in 2011. However, some of the HFAs and project owners \nexpressed concerns about meeting the 30 percent requirement because of unexpected delays stemming from the \ntime needed to assemble funding, litigation, or construction or permitting issues. For instance, as of June 30, 2010, \nabout 39 percent of Section 1602 Program projects that we reviewed have yet to close, leaving little time to meet \nthe spending deadline. Projects that do not meet the deadline would not be eligible to receive any additional \nSection 1602 Program funds. In response, other sources of funding might withdraw from the projects, and project \nowners would face difficulty finding replacement financing. Thus, the 30 percent spending requirement might stop \nprojects already under way-an unintended irony for a program designed to jumpstart stalled projects. Should there \nbe a significant number of such projects, Treasury will be challenged in ensuring that the program achieves its \nintended goals. Specifically, although Treasury has been developing guidance for how HFAs should monitor project \nspending, it has yet to develop contingency plans in the event that significant numbers of projects stall again\n\nRecommendations for Executive Action Because the absence of third-party investors reduces the amount of overall \nscrutiny TCAP projects would receive and HUD is currently not aware of how many projects lack third-party \n\n\n\ninvestors, HUD should develop a risk- based plan for its role in overseeing TCAP projects that recognizes the level \nof oversight provided by others\n\nTreasury should expeditiously provide HFAs with guidance on monitoring project spending and develop plans for \ndealing with the possibility that projects could miss the spending deadline and face further project interruptions\n\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation We provided a draft of this report to HUD for review and comment. HUD \nresponded by saying it will identify projects that are not funded by HOME funds and projects that have a nominal \ntax credit award. HUD said it will make these identifications after projects are complete and develop a monitoring \nplan tailored to these projects. It will be important to ensure that HUD's approach includes a risk-based plan. We \nrevised our section to recognize actions that HUD proposed in their response. HUD also provided technical \ncomments that we incorporated as appropriate\n\nWe provided a draft of this report to Treasury for review and comment\n\nTreasury responded by saying that it has taken a number of steps to ensure HFAs and project owners have a \ncomplete understanding of the 30 percent deadline and are prepared to comply with that requirement\n\nRecovery Act 154Under the continuous corrections period, recipients were able to modify this round of submissions \nfrom August 3, 2010, through September 20, 2010. The final update of this round of recipient reported data should \noccur on September 22, 2010\n\n155Under the Recovery Act, recipients are to file reports for any quarter in which they receive Recovery Act funds \ndirectly from the federal government. Reporting requirements apply to nonfederal recipients of funding, including \nentities such as state and local governments, educational institutions, nonprofits, and other private organizations. \nThese requirements apply to recipients who receive funding through the Recovery Act's discretionary \nappropriations, not recipients receiving funds through entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, or tax provisions. \nCertain other exceptions apply, such as for individuals\n\nRecovery Act, div. A, 1512, 123 Stat. at 287-288\n\n156Under the Recovery Act, recipients are required to submit reports no later than 10 days after the end of each \ncalendar quarter. The Board extended the reporting deadline by several days for all four rounds of reporting\n\nFurther, Treasury said it plans to continue monitoring the impact of the 30 percent spending deadline on the \nprogram and to provide additional guidance necessary to address unforeseen or unexpected circumstances\n\nIn our review of nine HFAs, we found that about 39 percent of the projects awarded funds in those nine states had \nnot yet closed, which is the first step to being able to draw funds from entities that provide financing\n\nTreasury's development of timely guidance may be particularly important because the December 31 deadline for \nspending 30 percent of program funding is quickly approaching. Treasury also provided technical comments that we \nincorporated as appropriate\n\nMany Recipients Are Citing Greater Ease Meeting Recovery Act Reporting Requirements, but Some Recipients \nContinue to Face Difficulties Calculating Jobs According to Recovery.gov, as of August 24, 2010, recipients \nreported on close to 200,000 awards indicating that the Recovery Act funded approximately 750,000 jobs during \nthe quarter beginning April 1, 2010, and ending June 30, 2010.154 As reported by the Recovery Accountability and \nTransparency Board (the Board), the job calculations are based on the number of hours worked in a quarter and \nfunded under the Recovery Act and expressed in FTEs.155 Officials from many states reported that the recipient \nreporting process was, by this fourth round, becoming routine\n\nGiven that no new reporting guidance was issued by OMB during the quarter and that a time extension was again \ngranted by the Board, recipients indicated they had few problems reporting.156 The FTE calculations, however, \n\n\n\ncontinue to be difficult for some recipients as evidenced by our field work in selected jurisdictions covering two \nenergy programs\n\nRecovery Act 157An award key is a derived field that identifies an award. This field is derived using a distinct \ncombination of the following component fields Award_type, Prime_DUNS, Award_id and Order_number\n\nFourth Round Data Indicate Progress in Linking of Recipient Reports, Which Can Facilitate Tracking Across \nQuarters We reviewed 74,249 prime recipient report records from Recovery.gov for this fourth round. This was \n3,592 more than submitted in the previous quarter and represents about a 5 percent increase from round three. For \nour analyses, in addition to the round four recipient report data, we also used the round one, round two, and round \nthree data as posted on Recovery.gov as of July 30, 2010\n\nWe examined recipient reports to identify the extent to which progress was being made in addressing several key \nlimitations we had found in our prior reports, including - the inability to link reports for the same project across \nquarters; - reporting errors; - unusual values, such as award amounts of zero, or relationships between values \nrequiring further review because they are unexpected; or - flaws in the data logic and consistency, such as reports \nmarked final that show a significant portion of the award amount not spent\n\nLinking Reports for the Same Projects across Quarters Our analysis showed better linkage of reports across \nquarters, but we still found instances where it appears reporting on projects was discontinued and may indicate \npossible issues with linking. The ability to link reports across quarters is critical to tracking project funding and \nFTEs that are key indicators of project results. For example, if two consecutive quarterly reports on the same \nproject are not linked, they become identified as two separate records, having an impact on the cumulative funding \ncalculation and the ability to associate FTEs reported in the separate quarters with one another. Similarly, \nmislinked reports would result in funding and FTEs from two different projects being incorrectly associated with one \nanother\n\nFor the data in Recovery.gov, the award key data field is used to track recipient reports across quarters.157 In our \nprevious report, we performed a series of matching operations between the three rounds of prime recipient reports \nusing the award key data field. We extended these matches to the current fourth round of prime recipient reports to \ncontinue reviewing the tracking of reports from one quarter to the next and to identify potential mismatches of \nreports. We\n\nRecovery Act identified 1,111 fourth round prime recipient reports-1.3 percent of the fourth round prime recipient \nreports-that reflected a break in reporting (e.g., recipient reports that appeared in rounds one and four but not \nrounds two and three or, similarly, appeared in rounds two and four but not round three, etc.). Even though the \nnumber of prime recipient reports has increased for this fourth round, this is a smaller number of reports showing \na break in reporting than we observed in the previous quarter. In our previous match across three rounds of \nreports, we identified 1,358 prime recipient reports that appeared in rounds one and three but not round two\n\nWe performed another analysis using the final report and project status indicator fields that also suggested some \nconcerns with missing linkages or potential errors in one of the reporting fields. As before, we identified recipient \nreports that only appeared in prior rounds, but not in round four\n\nFor prime recipients whose last report appeared in one of the prior three rounds, we examined the final report \nstatus and the project status fields, as those would presumably be the last reports from these projects. As shown in \ntable 11, of the total 14,542 prime recipients that did not report in round four, overall, 34 percent of their last prior \nround reports were not marked as final and 27 percent showed project status as being less than 50 percent \ncomplete or not started. These data suggest that, among other reasons, the projects may not have been completed, \nor they should have been linked to a report in a subsequent quarter, or that recipients were locked out of the \nreporting system\n\nThe percentage not marked as final is less than we observed in our previous analysis. However, the number of \nrecipient reports from round three that did not appear in round four, with no indication that the round three report \n\n\n\nwas final or that it was not close to completion, is quite similar to the number of discrepancies found in our last \nreport. Based on these results showing projects that were not marked as final and indicating that they were in the \nearlier stages of implementation, it seems reasonable to expect that a fourth round quarterly report should have \nbeen filed, but the necessary linkage has not been made. Alternatively, these fields may not show the correct status\n\nRecovery Act 158This function was provided to recipients at FederalReporting.gov in order to achieve more \naccurate tracking and analyses of reports across quarters. The function, however, did not allow users to link \ncurrent reports submitted in round four to ones submitted in round one or round two. Since there is no information \non the downloadable recipient reports about the use of this function by recipients, we are unable to assess the \nextent to which this function was applied\n\n159Both TAS and CFDA values are linked to specific agencies and their programs. The TAS codes identify the \nRecovery Act funding program source. The two leftmost characters of each TAS code form a data element, which is \nidentical with the two-digit numerical code used in the federal budgetary process to identify major federal \norganizations. The CFDA is a governmentwide compendium of federal programs, projects, services, and activities \nthat provide assistance or benefits. It contains assistance programs administered by departments. Each program is \nassigned a unique number where the first two digits represent the funding agency\n\nTable 11 Number, Final Report Designation, and Project Status of Prime Recipient Reports Not Appearing in \nRound Four Prime recipient reports last reported in Number of reports Percent not marked as final report \nPercent project status is\"not started\" or \"lessthan 50 percent complete\" Round 1 2,671 50 43 Round 2 5,983 30 23 \nRound 3 5,888 30 23 Total 14,542 34 27 Source GAO analysis of Recovery.gov data as of July 30, 2010\n\nDuring the most recent reporting quarter, recipients were able to reorganize unlinked or mislinked reports between \nrounds three and four\n\nThis may have facilitated the reduction in the proportion of reports that did not appear in round four, but that were \nnot marked as a final report.158 Reporting Errors In addition to our examination of report linking across quarters, \nwe continued our monitoring of errors or potential problems by repeating many of the analyses and edit checks \nreported in our earlier reports using the fourth reporting period data. The results of such analyses can help \nimprove the accuracy and completeness of the Recovery.gov data and inform planning for analyses of recipient \nreports over time. In general, the overall results were similar to what we observed in the previous round\n\nFor example, we identified a mismatch of 128 reports for Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) codes and 115 for \nCatalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) numbers.159 This is a small increase from the previous round, \nwhere 117 reports for TAS codes and 112 reports for CFDA number\n\nRecovery Act were mismatched to the agency name fields. We also checked the data fields on the number and \ntotal amount of small subawards of less than $25,000 and identified 443 reports where the amount reported in \nboth small subawards and small subawards to individuals were the same. This may be an indicator of improper \nkeying of data or inaccurate placement of award data in a data field, both of which negatively affect data accuracy\n\nThe 443 reports is a small increase from the 436 reports identified in the previous round. However, the number of \nreports where the same value was entered for the number of subawards and the total dollar value of subawards \nwas reduced, from 110 in round three to 101 in round four\n\nUnusual or Atypical Data Values Unusual or atypical data values alert the analyst to potential inaccuracies\n\nWe checked unusual or atypical data values by identifying reports where the award amount was zero or less than \n$10. We know that it is highly improbable that grants were awarded in these small amounts. Finding numbers like \nthese suggests improper keying of data or a misinterpretation of the guidance for FederalReporting.gov, both of \nwhich negatively affect data quality. We determined that the number of reports where this occurred was reduced to \n37 reports in this round out of the 74,249 prime recipient report records, down from 74 reports in round three\n\n\n\nFlaws in Data Logic and Consistency Data logic and consistency inform the analyst about whether the data are \nbelievable, given program guidelines and objectives. To assess consistency in the range between award amount \nand amounts reported as received or expended, we repeated our analyses of reports marked as final to identify \npossible over or underspending or misreporting by identifying final reports where the amount received or expended \nby the recipient was less than 75 percent of the award amount or exceeded the award amount by 10 percent or \nmore. If the final report status is correct, this check can help agencies identify where award funds were not being \nspent, which may indicate project implementation problems. If more funds were spent than were awarded, it may \nindicate problems with project financial accounts or controls. Similar to round three, 3 percent of the round four \nreports marked as final showed an amount received or expended that was not within 75 percent of the award \namount, and no reports exceeded the award amount by 10 percent or more\n\nRecovery Act Many State Officials Cited Increased Ease Compiling and Reporting Recipient Data Many state \nofficials noted that the reporting process is starting to become routine. They highlighted the fact that guidance \nremained stable for this round of reporting and that the early decision to extend the reporting deadline from July \n10 to July 14 contributed to the success of the reporting process. For example, officials in California stated that the \nfourth round of recipient reporting went a lot smoother than prior rounds; further, the extension of the deadline to \nJuly 14 allowed many of the state agencies to obtain more complete data through the end of the month of June and \nreport this to FederalReporting.gov. Similarly, officials in Colorado reported that the deadline extension to July 14 \nallowed for three additional working days for recipients to review their submissions and make necessary \ncorrections, which they felt improved the data quality. Officials in the District of Columbia reported that in general \nthere are no difficulties in the District's recipient reporting process and the process has become smoother with \neach subsequent reporting period, while officials in Illinois stated that with the reporting guidance remaining the \nsame, their agencies are becoming familiar with the reporting process. Officials in Georgia noted that they did not \nhear negative feedback from the state agencies regarding the recipient reporting process or the \nFederalReporting.gov Web site during this round\n\nA Few States Are Preparing for Changes in Leadership A number of the states we reviewed are anticipating \nleadership changes in the upcoming gubernatorial elections. In preparation, a few states noted that they are \nplanning or are undertaking changes in procedures to ensure continuity during a transition. For example, Michigan \nEconomic Recovery Office officials told us that because of anticipated changes to the state's administration, they \nmoved to a decentralized process during this round of reporting to allow time for state agencies to adjust to \nreporting. Michigan state agencies submitted quarterly recipient reports directly to the federal government via \nFederalReporting.gov rather than to the state's Economic Recovery Office, which had previously served as a \ncentralized reporting point. The officials told us that the decentralized reporting process for the quarter ending \nJune 30, 2010, went as smoothly as they had anticipated, and the quality of the data submitted by state agencies to \nFederalReporting.gov has improved over time. The governor's office in Colorado is in the initial planning phase of \ntransitioning to a new administration. Colorado state officials commented that the recipient reporting process has \nbecome a stable activity that should be able to move into a new administration with relatively little disruption. \nOfficials in Georgia did not have any real concerns regarding a transition in administration, as the state now has \nrecipient reporting systems and processes in place. California officials stated that steps have already been taken \nto ensure continuity in recipient reporting for the duration of the\n\nRecovery Act Recovery Act, while New Jersey officials noted that there were not many challenges related to \nrecipient reporting amid a transition to a new administration in their state\n\nStates Focus Their Recovery Act Web Sites on Providing Information to the Public and Continue to Enhance Web \nSite Features Many states noted that their Web sites were designed to provide information about Recovery Act \nprograms, funding, and eligibility to the people of their states. For example, officials in California commented that \nthe state Web site was designed for use by the average Californian to keep citizens informed about the Recovery \nAct's impact in California. Officials in Arizona noted that their Web site was designed to provide transparency to the \npublic on how stimulus funds are being spent in the state. Several state Web sites were also used to provide \npotential applicants information on how to obtain grants, assistance, and contracts. For example, officials in the \nDistrict of Columbia noted that their Web site provides information about Recovery Act funding received by the city \n\n\n\nand is a resource for people and organizations who are seeking opportunities to apply for grant funding, assistance, \nand potential contracts involving Recovery Act funds\n\nA number of state officials reported that they are continuing to add content to their Web sites. For example, Ohio's \nRecovery Act Web site recently added an interactive searchable map of funds awarded by location and enhanced \ninformation on the use of funds that are not covered by recipient reporting requirements. Officials in Texas said \nthat enhancements in the past year have included new tracking reports to follow dollars, an interactive county map, \nand disbursement information\n\nAs another example, the Massachusetts Recovery and Reinvestment Office recently created a new Recovery Act \nWeb site using an outside firm to help develop the most important features. An official from that office felt that the \nRecovery Act data collection and reporting effort will positively affect state government by improving policy and \nmanagement discussions through the use of data\n\nRecovery Act 160Prime recipients are nonfederal entities that receive Recovery Act funding as federal awards in \nthe form of grants, loans, or cooperative agreements directly from the federal government. Subrecipients are \nnonfederal entities that are awarded Recovery Act funding through a legal instrument from the prime recipient\n\nMost DOE EECBG and Weatherization Program Recipients We Interviewed Followed OMB's FTE Calculation \nGuidance, and DOE's Recovery Operations' Data Quality Efforts Continue to Develop EECBG Program The \nEECBG program is administered within DOE and was funded for the first time with the passage of the Recovery \nAct. Because over 2,300 state, local, and tribal governments are eligible for direct formula EECBG grants and the \ngrants are also awarded on a competitive basis, the program has many different types and sizes of recipients. For \nexample, each state-level recipient must use at least 60 percent of its allocation to provide subgrants to local \ngovernment units that are not eligible for direct grants, making the state the prime recipient while the local \ngovernment unit is a subrecipient\n\nLarger local government units receive grants directly from DOE, making them prime recipients.160 For the fourth \nround of reporting, 2,116 prime recipients of the program reported, as of July 30, 2010, that they created or \nretained about 2,265 FTEs funded by the Recovery Act\n\nWe interviewed 13 EECBG state-level and 19 local government recipients from our 17 selected jurisdictions about \ntheir FTE calculations for the fourth round of reporting. Given that the EECBG program is new, some of them had \nnot yet reported. For example, District of Columbia officials from the District's Department of the Environment told \nus that their work under the EECBG program had not started in time for them to report for the period that ended on \nJune 30, 2010. California Energy Commission officials noted that they had only a few EECBG recipients for the last \nreporting round, but there were 50 or 60 recipients for this fourth round\n\nAnother recipient commented that reporting was fairly easy now because they were only reporting internal data \nthey controlled, as compared to contractor data, but the official anticipated more complexity as the program \nexpands\n\nRecovery Act 161GAO-10-604, pp. 195-211\n\nOfficials from all of the state-level government units we interviewed that had FTEs to report said they followed \nOMB's December 18, 2009, guidance on FTE calculations. Specifically, they collected the number of hours worked \nthat were funded by the Recovery Act and divided that total by the number of hours in a full-time work schedule, \nwith defined processes in place to collect the EECBG recipient reported data. For example, Arizona Department of \nCommerce officials said that their office is responsible for reporting EECBG recipient data to the state's Office of \nEconomic Recovery centralized reporting team. The Office of Economic Recovery works closely with the Arizona \nDepartment of Commerce to ensure that the reporting data are accurate. Additionally, Arizona officials said there \nis a review and approval process in place to check that the hours reported by the program's subrecipients are \naccurate. Officials in the Colorado state energy office noted that it has been easier collecting hours worked from \n\n\n\nEECBG subrecipients because DOE requires reporting the hours worked and the same data is used to convert \nhours to FTEs for OMB reporting\n\nHowever, officials from a few other states said that generating the most comprehensive and complete job numbers \navailable from subrecipients is still a challenge. The same challenge surfaced in education and housing programs \nthat we previously reviewed.161 A few local government EECBG recipients we interviewed used methods other \nthan the OMB guidance to estimate their number of FTEs, possibly resulting in over or undercounting. For example, \nwhile DOE guidance explicitly states that the job-year estimate issued by the Council of Economic Advisers for job \ncreation potential is not appropriate in determining direct jobs created or retained and should not be used for \nreporting to either OMB or DOE, a New Jersey recipient informed us that she planned to use this number to \nestimate her township's FTEs. We informed the recipient that this was incorrect. In New York, a county official said \nthat an EECBG contractor was conducting work under a Recovery Act contract, but the county did not report any \nFTEs in its most recent quarterly report because the official did not think the contractor had any documented jobs \ncreated or saved. Related to the problem with complete FTE numbers, several EECBG recipients reported \nconfusion about including data from subrecipients on jobs, which OMB guidance states should be included. For \nexample, officials from a county in California stated they received conflicting information about including jobs from \nsubrecipients and vendors in their recipient reports. The\n\nRecovery Act officials said that the conflicting information emanated from different levels within DOE and between \nDOE's and OMB's guidance. The county officials believed they did not get a clear answer from DOE as to the \ndifference between subrecipients and vendors. Deciding that it was better to over report jobs than to under report \njobs, they included subrecipient and vendor hours that could be project-related in their recipient reports\n\nBased on the recipients we interviewed, there was some evidence that larger EECBG direct grant recipients \nseemed to conduct more thorough recipient reporting data quality reviews than smaller direct grant recipients, \npossibly due to their enhanced administrative capacity. For example, a large EECBG grant recipient in Georgia \nreported that it improves data accuracy by prepopulating reports for subrecipients so they only need to include job \nnumbers and vendor disbursements. In some instances, it also compares the subrecipient data to other documents, \nsuch as invoices and Davis-Bacon reports. However, according to a city official in Georgia, for their small grant, no \nspecific data quality reviews are conducted other than a city official reviewing the hours worked. Colorado state \nofficials said that communities that received under $2 million in direct formula grants have more difficulty \nadministering EECBG grants and meeting the reporting requirements because they have limited staff resources. \nAs an example, they mentioned a Colorado city, which received approximately $1 million in its EECBG grant. \nBecause of limited resources, the city has the person who administers its housing programs also administer the \nEECBG grant. The Colorado state officials believed that in the case of smaller communities, it would work better if \nthe state administered the EECBG grants and could report for the locality\n\nAccording to DOE officials, their EECBG program project officers have as minimum responsibilities making sure the \nrecipients that need to report are reporting, reviewing the quality of the recipient reporting data submitted, and \nensuring that recipients correct the data if the project officers detect errors. DOE monitors grant recipients primarily \nthrough its project officers, and project officers work directly with recipients to provide guidance and evaluate \nperformance. Project officers also gather and analyze information about project planning and implementation and \noutcomes to help ensure data quality and to ensure that statutory requirements are met. DOE stated that it has \nupdated the checklist that project officers use to monitor recipients, and it is also developing guidance that includes \nbest practices on how states should monitor their subrecipients. Such increased attention to monitoring recipients, \nincluding the quality of their data, could likely reduce the errors made by recipients\n\nRecovery Act Weatherization Assistance Program During the fourth round of recipient reporting, 58 prime \nrecipients of DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program submitted their quarterly data to FederalReporting.gov, and \nas of July 30, 2010, reported approximately 12,980 FTEs funded by the Recovery Act. We interviewed 8 state-level \nand 17 local weatherization assistance recipients from our 17 selected jurisdictions about their FTE calculations for \nthe fourth round of reporting. As with the EECBG grants, we found that most of the weatherization assistance \nrecipients we interviewed followed OMB's December 18, 2009, guidance regarding FTE calculations. A few \n\n\n\nrecipients, however, did not estimate the number of FTEs correctly for this round of reporting, resulting in under or \nover counting. For example, in one case, subrecipients in Florida did not include the hours worked by contractors \nwho performed weatherization work at individual homes, which they attributed to a lack of awareness of the \nrequirement to report the hours. In California, a local weatherization assistance provider also expressed confusion \nregarding reporting subcontractor hours. In Pennsylvania, a state official indicated some weatherization \nsubrecipients experienced difficulties, at least in their initial reports, in submitting FTE information through a new \nWeb-based reporting system that collects and calculates FTE information from the subrecipients. The \nPennsylvania weatherization recipients report hours through this system to the Department of Community and \nEconomic Development, but the system does not currently provide a method for subrecipients to certify the \naccuracy of what they report\n\nA few states had processes in place to help ensure weatherization assistance recipient reporting accuracy. For \nexample, a District of Columbia official said the weatherization program staff and Recovery Act grant managers \nreview submitted recipient reporting data from community-based organizations on a monthly basis before it is \nreported into the District's centralized reporting system. A New York official reported reviewing data submitted by \na sample of subrecipients and comparing jobs data to contract and payment information in the program base, while \nin Georgia, the state weatherization program officials reviewed each provider's submission and called each provider \nto discuss their numbers. This process resulted in some changes to vendor information and the number of jobs \ncreated or retained\n\nDOE's Recipient Reporting Data Quality Review According to DOE officials, during the quarter ending June 30, \n2010, 3,988 DOE recipients submitted reports, an increase of about 7 percent from the quarter ending March 31, \n2010, and an increase of about 28 percent from the 2009 year-end reporting period. DOE stated that only eight \nrecipients\n\nRecovery Act are considered nonreporters for this quarter, the majority of whom belong to a group with consistent \nchallenges in reporting\n\nAccording to a senior DOE official in the department's Recovery Operations Group, the department's data quality \nreview process for fourth round recipient reports was enhanced by several factors. The DOE official noted that \naccess to FederalReporting.gov during the reporting period helped DOE identify recipients who had not yet filed \nand helped assist those who had unsuccessfully filed, entered the wrong awarding agency code, or confused the \nreporting required by OMB with DOE's system. In addition, he said that communicating the extended time frame \nfor reporting before the reporting period actually began alleviated last-minute confusion or frustration on the part \nof recipients or reviewers, causing fewer recipients to wait until the last minute to file. Also, the official commented \nthat the July 14 to July 20, 2010, late submission period, during which recipients were still allowed to file, allowed \nrecipients experiencing access issues to FederalReporting.gov to submit reports. During this time period, DOE \nstaff was also able to identify and assist with issues such as Central Contractor Registration numbers and getting \nnew passwords for the last approximately 100 recipients filing reports. The DOE official noted that while the \ncontinuous correction provision has added to the workload of the DOE team, the period allows them greater time to \nreview more recipient reported data than previously, identify potential errors, and work with agency reviewers and \nrecipients to improve data quality\n\nThe senior official listed a number of frustrations DOE encountered during the fourth round of reporting, most of \nwhich are in areas where they felt FederalReporting.gov is technologically limited. For example, according to the \nofficial, FederalReporting.gov lacks some basic logic tests for matching award numbers, with most of the \nmismatches resulting from prefix differences. The lack of this matching capability creates extra work for the DOE \nstaff, but the Board declined to run separate matching routines for each agency\n\nIn an April 2010 audit report of DOE's efforts to ensure the accuracy and transparency of reported Recovery Act \nresults, the DOE Inspector General's (IG) office found that the department had taken a number of actions designed \nto do so and made two recommendations, which DOE\n\n\n\nRecovery Act 162U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Inspector General, Office of Audit Services, Accounting \nand Reporting for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by the Department of Energy's Funding \nRecipients, OAS-RA-10-06 (Washington, D.C., Apr. 1, 2010)\n\n163U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Review \nof the Effectiveness of Department/Agency Data Quality Review Processes (Washington, D.C., June 25, 2010)\n\nhad already started to address.162 For example, recipient reported data elements are compared to information \nmaintained in the department's financial systems. The IG recommended that DOE adjust the quality assurance \nprocess to include adding comparisons of other data elements, and a senior DOE official reported that for this \nround of reporting, the department has added several data elements to the original four that were reviewed \ncentrally by the headquarters Recovery Operations Group. Now reviewers compare recipient reports in \nFederalReporting.gov against DOE systems to identify recipient information that falls outside expected results in \nseven different areas. According to DOE, these areas are key project markers being tracked by the public, the \nadministration, Congress, and within the department to determine if the high-level goals of stimulating the economy \nand creating jobs outlined in the Recovery Act are being met. The DOE official said that increased attention has \nbeen placed on data quality within DOE systems as a result of this review process, which has created new \ncommunication channels and processes to identify issues and correct them. In line with the other IG \nrecommendation, DOE developed a training program for officials responsible for reviewing recipient data \nsubmissions that includes detailed steps and procedures for officials to follow when reviewing recipient quarterly \ndata for significant reporting errors and material omissions\n\nThe Inspector General Community Has a Series of Efforts Aimed at Increasing Recipient Reported Data Quality \nThe IG community is also performing data quality audits of federal agencies' data quality review efforts for their \nrecipient reports. In June, an IG-led Board review of the effectiveness of the agencies' data quality review \nprocesses was completed.163 To identify material omissions and significant errors that were not identified by the \nreviewed agencies for the quarter ending December 31, 2009, the IGs performed reviews of the recipient reported \ndata on FederalReporting.gov and attempted to compare that data with the data available in the agency-owned \nsystems. In general, the IGs found that the agency systems were legacy systems that had been developed, \ndesigned, and implemented prior to the Recovery Act. As a result, data elements were not always consistent and at \ntimes\n\nRecovery Act were nonexistent, making matching the data difficult if not impossible\n\nThe final report provided three recommendations to the Board to pursue discussions with the appropriate \ngovernment entities regarding improving the effectiveness of agency data quality reviews. These recommendations \nincluded establishing a uniform and consistent governmentwide award numbering system; making mandatory the \nsuggested data logic checks identified in OMB guidance; and issuing guidance to better define material omissions \nand significant errors. Although consensus was not reached among the IGs regarding the award numbering system, \nthere was general consensus regarding the logic checks and guidance recommendations. The next effort aimed at \nrecipient reported data quality includes a Board review focusing on key data reporting elements and the factors \ncontributing to errors in the recipient reports\n\nIntergovernmental Interaction Is a Critical Component of Recovery Act Operations and Will Likely Have Implications \nbeyond the Act The new procedures and tools developed to implement the Recovery Act are reshaping \nintergovernmental interactions and ways that governments collect, maintain, and report information. For example, \nthe federal government built a huge data warehouse, FederalReporting.gov, which is populated by thousands of \ngovernments and other Recovery Act fund recipients, to ensure that the public receives as much information as \npossible on the implementation of the Recovery Act. Because such a wide variety of information is required and \nsince some elements are being reported for the first time, OMB used a variety of methods to train federal agencies \nand recipients of Recovery Act funding on how to comply with their reporting responsibilities. OMB and federal \nagencies provided several types of clarifying information to recipients, as well as opportunities to interact and ask \nquestions or receive help with the reporting process\n\n\n\nThese included weekly phone calls between OMB and groups representing the state budget and comptrollers \noffices, weekly calls between state reporting leads, webinars, a call center, and e-mail outreach. In addition, the \nBoard recently reported that, along with the IG community, they have provided more than 2,000 training and \noutreach sessions to federal, state, and local government employees and to private sector individuals involved in \nRecovery Act implementation\n\nAccording to many of the state officials we interviewed, the Recovery Act's reporting requirements also promoted \nmore interaction between state and federal agencies, state agencies, and within departments of these state \nagencies. For example, Ohio officials stated that the governor's stimulus office had established contacts with OMB, \nadministration officials, and other federal agency contacts through work on Recovery Act implementation and \nmonitoring. Officials from Illinois noted that recipient\n\nRecovery Act 164National Association of State Budget Officers, Intergovernmental Communication and the \nRecovery Act (Washington, D.C., July 28, 2010)\n\nreporting was one of the few efforts that brought their otherwise very independent state agencies together. \nColorado state officials reported that the program and accounting staffs within each state agency are working \ntogether closely to help ensure the accuracy and quality of the Recovery Act data. A few state officials, however, \ncommented that although communication with federal agencies and other entities has increased due to the recipient \nreporting requirements, the communication is aimed primarily at dispelling confusion and is not necessarily \npositive. For example, Texas state officials commented that the one change that has been prompted by recipient \nreporting is the significant effort required to communicate reporting requirements to subrecipients and to collect, \nreview, and submit the data\n\nOfficials from a number of states expressed hopes that the increase in intergovernmental interactions resulting from \nthe Recovery Act reporting requirements will continue after the act's reporting requirements expire\n\nFor example, District of Columbia Recovery Act coordinators schedule a weekly teleconference for all District \nagencies receiving Recovery Act funds to provide status updates and have discussions relating to the Recovery \nAct. They intend to continue scheduling the meetings after the Recovery Act funds are expended in order to \nmaintain communication on other grant-related topics. Michigan officials reported that state agencies are working \nwith each other in a way they have not before. They said the Recovery Act has facilitated collaboration, citing that \nthe act removed some barriers to interaction between state agencies because the timeline for complying with \nRecovery Act requirements has been so short that agencies must work together to meet requirements, which has \nyielded many positive effects. Michigan officials noted that they hope the changes will be long-standing. As another \nexample, a representative from a state association described Recovery Act-related problem solving between the \naudit and technology communities. These interactions included discussions where there was a flow of information \nat the policy, technological, and political levels that they would like to see continued\n\nA recent report issued by the National Association of State Budget Officers echoed the responses from many of the \nstate officials we interviewed.164 The report noted that during the months before recipient reporting began in \nOctober 2009 and in the months since, the Recovery Act helped to foster\n\nRecovery Act 165Congress passed the Single Audit Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. ch. 75, to promote, among other \nthings, sound financial management, including effective internal controls, with respect to federal awards \nadministered by nonfederal entities. The Single Audit Act requires states, local governments, and nonprofit \norganizations expending $500,000 or more in federal awards in a year to obtain an audit in accordance with the \nrequirements set forth in the act. A Single Audit consists of (1) an audit and opinions on the fair presentation of the \nfinancial statements and the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards; (2) gaining an understanding of and \ntesting internal control over financial reporting and the entity's compliance with laws, regulations, and contract or \ngrant provisions that have a direct and material effect on certain federal programs (i.e., the program requirements); \nand (3) an audit and an opinion on compliance with applicable program requirements for certain federal programs. \nThe Single Audit Act requires that recipients submit their financial reporting packages, including the Single Audit \n\n\n\nreport, to the federal government's audit clearinghouse no later than 9 months after the end of the period being \naudited. As a result, an audited entity may not receive feedback needed to correct an identified internal control \ndeficiency over compliance until the latter part of the subsequent fiscal year movement toward a more open and \ncommunicative atmosphere between both the federal government and states, as well as between individual states, \nwhile also providing important lessons currently being used in the implementation of the Federal Funding \nAccountability and Transparency Act of 2006 and the recent health care legislation. The report maintained that \nstates have noted that increased transparency on government spending is a worthy goal which they support, as \nlong as the federal government maintains a level of communication that allows for the effective and efficient \nimplementation of any accountability requirements\n\nOversight and Accountability Efforts Actions Are Needed to Improve Single Audit and Federal Follow-up as \nOversight Accountability Mechanisms OMB has indicated that Single Audits play a key role in the achievement of its \naccountability objectives over Recovery Act funds, which include helping to ensure whether Recovery Act funds are \nused for authorized purposes and that risks of fraud, waste, error, and abuse are mitigated. A Single Audit includes \nthe auditor's schedule of findings and questioned costs, internal control and compliance deficiencies, and the \nauditee's corrective action plans along with a summary of prior audit findings that includes planned and completed \ncorrective actions. We identified significant concerns with the Single Audit process that (1) diminish the \neffectiveness of the Single Audit as an oversight accountability mechanism and (2) could allow risks associated with \nRecovery Act funds to persist\n\nThe Single Audit Act165 and related OMB Circular No. A-133 Audits of\n\nRecovery Act 166This circular is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act and sets forth standards for obtaining \nconsistency and uniformity among federal agencies for the audit of states, local governments, and nonprofit \norganizations expending federal awards\n\n167See Recovery Act States' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address Implementation \nChallenges and Bolster Accountability, GAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C. May 26, 2010) for a status of OMB's \nimplementation of GAO's recommendations\n\n168Internal control deficiencies refer to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses as defined by generally \naccepted auditing standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Government \nAuditing Standards, issued by the Government Accountability Office. A material weakness is a significant \ndeficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material \nmisstatement of the subject matter will not be prevented. Auditors report internal control deficiencies over \ncompliance requirements applicable to the major programs in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-133\n\nStates, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations166 do not adequately address the risks associated with \nthe current environment in which billions of dollars in federal awards are being expended quickly through new and \nexisting programs associated with the Recovery Act. In our prior bimonthly reports, we made several \nrecommendations to improve OMB's oversight of Recovery Act-funded programs through the use of Single Audits. \nOMB has implemented some, but not all, of our recommendations.167 OMB's Single Audit Internal Control Project \n(project) highlighted areas where significant improvements in the Single Audit process are needed\n\nOMB encouraged auditors from states that volunteered to participate in the project to communicate internal control \ndeficiencies168 over compliance for selected Recovery Act programs earlier than required under statute. The \nproject has been a collaborative effort between volunteer states receiving Recovery Act funds, their auditors, and \nthe federal government. One of the project's goals was to achieve more timely communication of internal control \ndeficiencies for higher-risk Recovery Act programs so that corrective action can be taken more quickly. GAO \nassessed the results of the project and found that it met several of its objectives and that the project was helpful in \nidentifying critical areas where further OMB actions are needed to improve the Single Audit process over Recovery \nAct funding. The project also required that auditee management provide, 2 months earlier than required under \nstatute, plans for correcting internal control deficiencies to the cognizant agency for audit for immediate distribution \n\n\n\nto the appropriate federal awarding agency. The federal agency was then to have provided its concerns relating to \nmanagement's plan of corrective actions in a written decision\n\nRecovery Act We found, however, that (1) most federal awarding agencies did not issue their management \ndecisions about the corrective actions within the project's required time frames, (2) the current reporting time \nframes for the Single Audit process are not conducive to the timely identification and correction of internal control \ndeficiencies, and (3) OMB's Single Audit guidance is not timely-specifically for 2010 audits, as well as guidance for \na subsequent project. In our May 2010 bimonthly report, we recommended that OMB issue its Single Audit \nguidance, including guidance for future projects, in a timely manner so that auditors can efficiently plan their audit \nwork, and OMB concurred with our recommendation. According to several state auditors who participated in the \nproject, OMB's issuance of its guidance in an untimely manner adversely impacts the auditors' ability to plan and \nconduct their Single Audits. They added that untimely project guidance would also hinder their ability to participate \nin future OMB projects intended to provide earlier communication and correction of internal control deficiencies \nidentified in Recovery Act programs\n\nWe recommend that the Director of OMB strengthen the Single Audit and federal follow-up as oversight \naccountability mechanisms by (1) shortening the timeframes required for issuing management decisions by federal \nawarding agencies to grant recipients and (2) issuing the OMB Circular No. A-133 Compliance Supplement no later \nthan March 31 of each year\n\nSingle Audits as an Oversight Accountability Mechanism for Recovery Act Programs OMB has indicated that Single \nAudits would serve as important oversight accountability mechanism for Recovery Act programs, which have \nconsiderable risks. The most significant of these risks are associated with - new programs that may not have the \ninternal controls and accounting systems in place to help ensure that funds are distributed and used in accordance \nwith program regulations and objectives, - Recovery Act funding increases for existing programs that may exceed \nthe capacity of existing internal controls and accounting systems, - the more extensive accountability and \ntransparency requirements for Recovery Act funds that require the implementation of new controls and procedures, \nand - increased risks because of the need to spend funds quickly\n\nWe reported in our previous bimonthly reports that we were concerned that, as federal funding of Recovery Act \nprograms accelerates, the Single Audit process may not provide the timely accountability and focus needed to \nassist recipients in making necessary adjustments to internal controls to provide assurances that the money is \nbeing spent as effectively as possible\n\nRecovery Act to meet program objectives. We also reported that the Single Audit reporting deadline is too late to \nprovide audit results in time for the audited entity to take action on internal control deficiencies noted in Recovery \nAct programs\n\nIn those prior reports, we made several recommendations to OMB for improving the Single Audit Process to \naddress the increased risks by helping ensure that Recovery Act funds are not used for unauthorized purposes and \nthat risks of fraud, waste, error, and abuse are mitigated\n\nOMB has implemented some, but not all, of these recommendations. In response to one of our recommendations, \nin October 2009 OMB implemented a project to encourage earlier reporting and timely correction of internal control \ndeficiencies identified in Single Audits that included Recovery Act programs. OMB's guidance for the project stated \nthat this earlier communication of internal control deficiencies over compliance would allow participating auditees to \ncorrect internal control deficiencies related to Recovery Act funds in a timely manner, thereby reducing potential \nfuture unallowable costs\n\nWe assessed the results of the project and found that the project met its original objectives of (1) achieving more \nthan 10 volunteer states participating in the project, (2) having the participating auditors issue interim internal \ncontrol reports for the selected programs at least 3 months earlier, and (3) having auditee management issue \ncorrective action plans to resolve internal control deficiencies at least 2 months earlier than required by OMB \nCircular No. A-133. The project also increased the level of awareness by the auditors of some of the risks \n\n\n\nassociated with Recovery Act funds and, in some cases, increased the communication and interaction between the \nauditors, program officials, and the cognizant agency for audit concerning internal control deficiencies related to \nRecovery Act funds. For example, many of the auditors who responded to our survey stated that the project \nincreased awareness of internal control deficiencies and focused attention on the need for federal agencies to be \nmore involved in pursuing corrective actions to develop more timely corrective action plans for internal control \ndeficiencies related to programs receiving Recovery Act funding The project also called for federal awarding \nagencies to actively work with auditees to resolve high-risk findings in the most expeditious manner. One of the \nproject's goals was to achieve more timely communication of internal control deficiencies for higher-risk Recovery \nAct programs so that corrective action could be taken more quickly. The implementation of\n\nRecovery Act 169One of the states that participated in the project has a fiscal year that ends on August 31 rather \nthan on June 30. Therefore, OMB gave this state until March 1, 2010, to report on its fiscal year 2009 internal \ncontrol deficiencies. OMB made this change so that the state's auditors would have the same amount of time to \ncomplete their test work as the other project participants did. All of the other states that participated fiscal year \nended on June 30, 2009, and OMB required them to report by December 31, 2009\n\ncorrective actions of internal control deficiencies will help to ensure that Recovery Act funds are used as intended\n\nMost Federal Awarding Agencies Did Not Provide Their Management Decisions within the Prescribed Time Frames \nThe project's guidelines called for the federal awarding agencies to complete two steps by April 30, 2010 (1) \nperform a risk assessment of the internal control deficiency and identify those with the greatest risk to Recovery Act \nfunding, and (2) identify corrective actions taken or planned by the auditee. OMB guidance called for this \ninformation to be included in a management decision that the federal agency was to have issued to the auditee's \nmanagement, the auditor, and the cognizant agency for audit. As of April 30, 2010, most federal awarding agencies \nhad not provided their management decisions on the states' corrective action plans as required under the project's \nguidelines. Several of the state auditors and state program officials we surveyed emphasized the need for more \ntimely communication from the federal awarding agencies, which is important for state agencies to gain a clear \nunderstanding of needed corrective actions. It is also important for auditors so that they can monitor progress \ntowards addressing Single Audit results. OMB Circular No. A-133 requires management decisions to be issued by \nfederal awarding agencies within 6 months of receipt of the audit report. However, the project's guidelines required \nthe federal awarding agencies to issue a management decision as promptly as possible and not later than 90 days \nafter the date that the corrective action plan was received by the cognizant agency for audit\n\nThe internal control reports for the project identified internal control deficiencies in at least 24 Recovery Act \nprograms awarded by seven federal agencies by December 31, 2009.169 Moreover, under the project's guidelines, \nmost corrective action plans were completed by January 31, 2010, 2 months earlier than the time frames under \nOMB Circular No. A-133 and were concurrently provided to the federal awarding agencies. Despite the federal \nawarding agencies having the internal control reports and\n\nRecovery Act 170The project's second milestone required that auditee management provide the interim \ncommunication report and a corrective action plan to the cognizant federal agency by January 31, 2010. For 10 of \nthe 13 states that submitted the required internal control report, the corrective action plans were included in the \ninterim communication report. In three instances, the plans were provided in a separate report\n\n171HHS, the cognizant agency for audit, has designated the HHS Office of the Inspector General to perform \ncertain responsibilities relating to Single Audits\n\nonly three of the seven federal awarding agencies had submitted some of the relevant management decisions on \ncorrective actions by May 14, 2010. We asked OMB officials to provide us with an update of the number of \nmanagement decisions that had been submitted by the federal awarding agencies through August 5, 2010. OMB \nprovided a summarized list of the total number of management decisions by agency where the auditee and the \nfederal agency had agreed on action to be taken to address the report findings but had not traced these totals to \nthe detailed documentation to verify the summary information\n\n\n\ncorrective action plans in January 2010,170 It is important to note that an awarding agency's issuance of a \nmanagement decision does not mean that internal control deficiencies have been corrected; rather, the \nmanagement decision reflects the agency's approval of the auditee's proposed corrective action. Although some \ncorrective actions can be implemented quickly, others can take months or years to implement. The issuance of \ntimely management decisions by federal agencies is important because it can affect the timeliness of the auditees' \nimplementation of corrective actions to address internal control deficiencies concerning Recovery Act programs. For \nexample, according to an HHS Office of Inspector General official, auditees sometimes wait until they receive a \nmanagement decision before taking corrective action on internal control deficiencies.171 On March 22, 2010, OMB \nissued memorandum M- 10-14, Updated Guidance on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which among \nother things, instructs federal agencies to take immediate action as appropriate to review and act on Single Audit \nfindings. However, as indicated by the project's results, further efforts by OMB are needed to help ensure that \nfederal agencies provide their management decisions on the corrective action plans in a timely manner\n\nRecovery Act 172According to OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non- Profit \nOrganizations, (June 27, 2003 and June 26, 2007) section .400 (c) (5) and section .405 (a) - (e), the federal agency \nis responsible for issuing a management decision on audit findings within 6 months after receipt of the audit report. \nAdditional OMB guidance to federal agencies focused specifically on audit follow up is found in OMB Circular No. A-\n50, Audit Follow-up (September 29, 1982)\n\nTime Frames of the Single Audit Process Do Not Facilitate the Timely Identification and Correction of Audit Findings \nin Recovery Act Programs Under the current time frames for identifying and correcting audit findings provided by \nthe Single Audit Act and OMB Circular No. A-133, it could take years to correct significant deficiencies and material \nweaknesses that expose Recovery Act funds to misuse or fraud. For example, in accordance with current \nrequirements, a material weakness that has been identified by the auditor for an entity that has a June 30, 2009, \nfiscal year- end is to be reported in the Single Audit report to be issued by March 31, 2010, along with the \nauditee's corrective action plan. The federal awarding agency would have 6 months or until September 30, 2010, \nfrom receipt of the Single Audit report to communicate a written management decision to the auditee.172 As a \nresult, it may take 15 months or more since the end of the fiscal year in which the audit finding was initially identified \nbefore any work is begun. Auditee's management reports their progress in taking corrective action in the schedule \nof prior audit findings where the status of the finding is reported as either corrected (closed) or not (open). The \nauditor then reviews this schedule and it is included in the next Single Audit reporting package. If the awarding \nagency delayed issuing a management decision to the auditee, it is possible that corrective action on the finding \nwas also delayed, and, as a result, the finding may have remained open. In addition, several state auditors have \nexpressed frustration regarding Single Audit findings that remain open years after they were initially identified, \nwithout the auditee or the federal awarding agency taking action. The lack of attention to ensuring prompt corrective \naction impairs the federal government's ability to ensure that unallowable costs have been repaid or that internal \ncontrol deficiencies have been corrected. Shortening the timeframes required for issuing management decisions by \nfederal agencies and monitoring the auditee's implementation of timely corrective actions by the federal agency will \nhelp to ensure that appropriate audit follow-up and resolution are achieved\n\nFigure 31 illustrates an example of the Single Audit reporting time frames\n\nRecovery Act Figure 31 Illustration of the Single Audit Reporting Time Frames for Entities with a June 30, 2009, \nFiscal Year-End As we reported in prior Recovery Act reports, the problem that the Single Audit reports are not \ndue until 9 months after the fiscal year-end was exacerbated by the extensions to the deadline to file Single Audit \nreports\n\nThe federal awarding agencies, consistent with OMB guidance, had routinely granted such extensions. In February \n2010, HHS, the cognizant agency for audit, adopted a policy of no longer approving requests for such extensions. \nFurther, in March 2010, OMB issued a memorandum, in response to our recommendation, that directed federal \nagencies to not grant any requests made to extend the Single Audit reporting deadlines for fiscal years 2009 \nthrough 2011. Despite this guidance, we found that the This timeline show the length of time that passes from when \nan audit finding first occurs and the subsequent reporting of the status of the finding (i.e. closed or open) in the \n\n\n\nSingle Audit reporting package. This example uses an entity with a June 30 fiscal year end. The finding occurs \nafter the Recovery Act was enacted on February 17, 2009, but before June 30, 2009, fiscal year end. The auditor \nreports the finding in the Single Audit report, due March 31, 2010, 9 months after fiscal year end. The federal \nawarding agency's management decision is due by September 30, 2010, which is now 15 months since June 30, \n2009. The auditee's management may or may not take action to correct the finding after receiving the management \ndecision, and the auditor evaluates the status of the finding in order to report it as either closed, or remaining open \nin the Single Audit Report due no later than March 31, 2011, that is 21 months after fiscal year 2009 when the \nfinding first occurred\n\nRecovery Act 173The five states are Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Although the FAC \nreceived initial Single Audit reporting packages from Colorado, Georgia, and Massachusetts by the March 31 due \ndate, the FAC received subsequent information, which completed the reporting requirements from these states, \nafter the March 31 due date\n\n174According to OMB data, as of August 5, 2010, five of the 16 states that participated in the OMB Single Audit \nInternal Control Project (Colorado, Georgia, Ohio, South Dakota, and Tennessee) did not file their completed Single \nAudit reporting package by the March 31, 2010, due date. Although FAC received the initial Single Audit reporting \npackages from Colorado and Georgia by the March 31 due date, FAC received subsequent information which \ncompleted the reporting requirements from these states after the March 31 due date\n\nAs of August 24, 2010, the FAC had not yet received Tennessee's reporting package for the fiscal year 2009 \nSingle Audit\n\nFederal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) did not receive Single Audit reporting packages for fiscal year ending 2009 \nfrom 5 of the 16 selected states and the District of Columbia within the 9-month time frame provided by statute.173 \nSingle Audit reporting packages include a schedule of internal control deficiencies and the auditee's plans for \ncorrecting them. Thus, when submissions of reporting packages are late, the auditees' efforts to correct internal \ncontrol deficiencies may be delayed. According to OMB guidance, late submissions of the Single Audit to FAC in \neither of the 2 prior fiscal years would prevent the auditor from attaining low-risk auditee status, which could likely \nresult in an increase in the scope of audit coverage to address the additional risk for the subsequent year's audit of \nthe auditee. While the focus of our bi-monthly reports has been on Recovery Act funds, in general, the Single Audit \npertains to federal expenditures awarded from the Recovery Act as well as from other federal sources; thus, internal \ncontrol deficiencies identified in a program expending Recovery Act funds would generally affect all other sources of \nfederal funds for that program as well\n\nAs of August 5, 2010, five of the states participating in the project did not submit their completed fiscal year 2009 \nSingle Audit reports to FAC by the March 31 due date; one of these states had not yet submitted its fiscal year \n2009 Single Audit Report as of August 24, 2010.174 While these states were able to meet the project's reporting \ndeadline, they were not able to meet the deadline to submit the state's Single Audit reporting package\n\nSingle Audit Guidance Continues to Be Issued in an Untimely Manner We identified other concerns through our \nreview of the project that point to the need for OMB to issue all Single Audit guidance in a more timely manner. \nSpecifically, 12 of the 14 participating state auditors who responded to our survey stated that guidance for any \nfuture OMB projects should be more timely. In addition, more than half of the auditors who\n\nRecovery Act responded to our survey indicated that they had concerns with timeliness issues relating to the \nrelease of OMB's 2009 Circular No. A-133 Compliance Supplement. OMB issued the Compliance Supplement in \ntwo stages, the initial one in May 2009 and an addendum in August 2009. This guidance was issued after the \nSingle Audits for entities with a June 30, 2009, fiscal year-end were already under way. Most of the participating \nauditors told us that they needed the information as early as February 2009, or at least by April 2009, to effectively \nplan their work. Some of these state auditors stated that the OMB guidance was issued too late, causing \ninefficiencies and disruptions in the planning of audit procedures\n\n\n\nOMB officials told us that they planned to issue the 2010 Compliance Supplement in late May 2010. In our May \n2010 bi-monthly report, we recommended that OMB issue its Single Audit guidance, including guidance for future \nprojects, in a timely manner so that auditors can efficiently plan their audit work. OMB concurred with our \nrecommendation. However, OMB issued the 2010 Compliance Supplement on July 29, 2010-again after the audit \nplanning and work for Single Audits for entities with a June 30, 2010, fiscal year end was already under way\n\nOMB officials stated that the delay in issuing the 2010 Compliance Supplement was primarily due to the additional \nattention needed to include more Recovery Act programs in the Compliance Supplement and information regarding \nthe audit procedures for reviewing Recovery Act reporting requirements. OMB had provided the American Institute \nof Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Governmental Audit Quality Center and the National Association of State \nAuditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers (NASACT) with draft Single Audit guidance in May 2010\n\nAICPA and NASACT posted the draft to its Web sites for auditors to use for planning their work. However, some \nauditors we spoke with stated that because the guidance was not in a final form, it still impacted their ability to \nefficiently plan and conduct their work\n\nWe also reported that OMB initiated the first project in October 2009 well after most of the audit work had been \nunderway, resulting in some of the project's benefits not being realized. The project's guidance called for the \nauditors to complete their internal control work as of November 30, 2009, and to report internal control deficiencies \nby December 31, 2009. The project's guidelines included incentives to provide the participating auditors with some \nrelief in their workload to encourage them to participate in the project. Under the project's guidelines, auditors were \nnot required to perform risk assessments of smaller federal programs that they would otherwise need to complete. \nHowever, since most of the auditors had already completed the risk assessments by the time the project had\n\nRecovery Act started, most of the participating auditors stated that they did not experience any audit relief\n\nOMB has stated that it plans to have a second phase of the Single Audit Internal Control Project for fiscal year \n2010. However, as of August 5, 2010, OMB had not yet defined the parameters of the project and issued guidance \nfor potential volunteer participants. OMB has not provided detailed guidance that would explain incentives for \nvolunteering to participate in the project, types of entities that will be permitted to participate, the scope of the \nproject (including the specific programs that participants could select from), the number of participants it is seeking, \nor the time frames for beginning and ending the project\n\nWe continue to report concerns about the Single Audit process because it does not provide a means for the timely \nidentification and correction of internal control deficiencies or other findings relating to Recovery Act programs. This \nlimits the effectiveness of the Single Audit process as an oversight accountability mechanism and exposes \nRecovery Act funds to increased risk of misuse or fraud. We recommend that the Director of OMB strengthen the \nSingle Audit and federal follow-up as oversight accountability mechanisms by (1) shortening the timeframes \nrequired for issuing management decisions by federal awarding agencies to grant recipients, and (2) issuing the \nOMB Circular No. A-133 Compliance Supplement no later than March 31 of each year\n\nFraud, Waste, and Abuse Allegations GAO Has Received That Are Related to the Recovery Act As of August 11, \n2010, we have received 224 allegations of Recovery Act wrongdoing from the public. We have closed 137 of these \ncases because the allegations were nonspecific or lacked information about fraud, waste, or abuse. Another 44 \nwere investigated further and closed by us or the appropriate agency inspector general (IG) when no violations \nwere found\n\nOf allegations that are open, 16 are being handled by us and 27 by an IG\n\nWe generally refer allegations to an IG when that office is already pursuing the same or a similar complaint. We \nperiodically contact the IGs to determine the status of our referrals. We will continue to evaluate all Recovery Act \nallegations received through FraudNet and provide updates in future reports\n\n\n\nRecovery Act 175Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-\nReview of the Effectiveness of Department/Agency Data Quality Review Processes (Washington, D.C., June 25, \n2010)\n\n176The six inspectors general participating in the review were the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nthe Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nNational Science Foundation, and the Department of Agriculture\n\nRecovery Accountability and Transparency Board Initiatives The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board \n(the Board) continues to take steps to identify and report on potential areas for risk to fraud, waste, and \nmismanagement of Recovery Act funds. The Board recently published its third report in its series of reviews \nregarding recipient reporting data quality. In addition, the Board continues to augment its various initiatives for \ndetecting potential instances of risk in Recovery Act contracting and turn over information regarding such instances \nto the appropriate inspectors general for further review. The Board also continues to organize coordinated reviews \nperformed by its inspectors general working group aimed at further assessments of the management and oversight \nof Recovery Act spending. The Board is also planning to expand on some of its initiatives to strengthen future \noversight as implementation of the Recovery Act continues\n\nBoard Reports Focus on Data Quality In June 2010, the Board reported on the third of three phases of its \ninspectors general working group's review of actions taken by agencies to improve the quality of data that recipients \nof Recovery Act funds are providing for posting to the public Web site.175 Working in conjunction with the Board, \nsix inspectors general reported that their agencies had issued policies and general procedures that follow OMB's \nguidance; however, the implementation of their respective guidance differed significantly among the agencies and \ntheir subunits.176 We discuss the results of the inspectors general work in more detail under the recipient reportin \nCurrent Board Initiatives The Board continues to use a variety of initiatives to monitor Recovery Act spending in an \neffort to identify potential areas at risk for fraud, waste, and abuse. The Board's current oversight initiatives include \nthe following - maintaining a Fraud Hotline, which receives complaints of potential fraud, waste, and abuse from the \npublic, and referring potential cases to the respective inspector general for further review\n\nRecovery Act 177According to the Board staff, the majority of the complaints received via the fraud hotline did not \ncontain any actionable information; for example, some complaints contained a generalized comment on the \nRecovery Act rather than any specific allegation of wrongdoing. The Board refers those that are actionable to the \nappropriate inspector general when there is a specific allegation of wrongdoing or multiple factors indicate a \npossible area of risk\n\n178According to a Board official, 63 of the 534 inspectors general products published on Recovery.gov are interim \nreports published to raise important issues with agency management in an expedited manner\n\n- performing data analyses on publicly available information about Recovery Act recipients. The Board continues to \nmodify its analytical efforts to provide insights on potential risk areas for the oversight community. The Board \nincreased its staff, added more software, and obtained new public data sources to provide for additional analyses\n\nAs of July 31, 2010, the Board had received 2,398 Fraud Hotline complaints.177 As a result of these complaints as \nwell as the Board's data analyses, the Board had referred 184 leads to various inspectors general as of July 31, \n2010. Over half of these leads involved the potential misappropriation of funds or nonperformance of services\n\nBoard Coordination and Monitoring of Inspectors General Initiatives The Board continues to coordinate audits \ncarried out by the inspectors general working group and monitor the independent efforts of the inspectors general \nrelated to the Recovery Act. The inspectors general working group has one audit under way reviewing the accuracy \nof selected fields of recipient reporting data. In addition, the working group is beginning a review of potential fraud \nindicators for grants programs in September 2010\n\nThe Board continues to review monthly reports submitted by the inspectors general on the number and status of \nRecovery Act-related audits and investigations each has initiated. As of July 31, 2010, the inspectors general \n\n\n\nreceived 3,806 complaints related to the Recovery Act and reported that they have 424 active investigations; 141 \ninvestigations closed without action; and 474 audits, inspections, evaluations, or reviews in process. The inspectors \ngeneral also reported they have completed 689 work products on Recovery Act-related issues since the act was \npassed- 534 of which are published on Recovery.gov and 155 of which are not publicly available since they contain \nproprietary or sensitive information.178 In addition, the inspectors general, in conjunction with the Board, reported \nthat they have conducted 2,231 training and outreach sessions related to Recovery Act issues\n\nRecovery Act 179The DUNS-Data Universal Numbering System-number is a unique 9-digit identification number \nprovided by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc., for each physical location of a business or organization. The DUNS number is \na unique identifier for an organization and is used to identify which business or organization is submitting reporting \ninformation to the government for federal contracts\n\n180Recovery Act, div. A 1541-1546, 123 Stat. at 295-296\n\nImpact of the Board and Inspectors General Efforts According to Board representatives, an outcome of the Board \nand its work has been to shift the focus of the inspectors general community to the prevention of fraud, rather than \njust the identification and correction of it\n\nAs discussed earlier, the Board's data analysis capabilities provides the inspectors general with leads regarding \npotential risks associated with Recovery Act funds and recipients. In addition, over half of the training sessions \nprovided have been focused on preventing fraudulent use of Recovery Act funds. According to Board \nrepresentatives, the Board's work has also resulted in changes in the data to provide for better visibility over the use \nof federal funds. For example, a data field was added in FedBizOpps for recording a company's DUNS number;179 \na DUNS number is an important data element in tracking companies' transactions with the government, and \nincluding this information is expected to enhance data matching capabilities Board Plans for the Future Board \nrepresentatives explained that the Board and its predictive analysis capabilities are considered a template for \nchanging how the government does business. In the short- term, the Board would like to develop predictive analysis \ntools for federal agencies' use, such as a list of databases to search and steps to be taken to identify risks. In \naddition, the Board is considering plans for the transition of its analytic capabilities elsewhere in the federal \ngovernment when the Board's authorization expires at the end of fiscal year 2013\n\nRecovery Independent Advisory Panel In February 2009, the Recovery Act provided for a Recovery Independent \nAdvisory Panel to make recommendations to the Board on ways to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse relating to \nRecovery Act funds.180 Four members of the Advisory Panel were appointed by the President in March 2010. At its \nfirst public meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in August 2010, state and City of Boston officials presented \ninformation and addressed the panel's questions about their actions to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. In addition, \nthey discussed the content and structure of the state Recovery Act Web site, as well as continuity among state and\n\nRecovery Act local Web sites with the federal government's Recovery.gov Web site. The panel also held a closed \nsession to discuss techniques to investigate fraud\n\nCurrently, the panel plans to hold a series of public meetings across the United States, and has tentatively planned \nits next public meeting for November 2010\n\nAudit Activities Involving Recovery Act Funds Continue at the State and Local Levels State and local oversight and \naudit entities across the 16 selected states and the District continue to actively audit Recovery Act funds. As \nmentioned in our May 2010 report, many of these audits are conducted through the state Single Audit process-an \naccountability mechanism for overseeing federal funds at the state and local levels. These audits spanned many \nprograms and primarily focused on programs that have been assessed as having higher risk of noncompliance with \nfederal program requirements, such as weatherization, transportation, and Medicaid\n\nHowever, according to officials from several of our selected states and the District, budget and staffing constraints \nhave limited the number of Recovery Act audit reviews they could perform. Audit report findings have covered \nvarious areas including financial management and compliance laws or regulations. In some cases, the audits of \n\n\n\nRecovery Act funds identified and reported audit findings that were subsequently addressed by audited entities. In \nother cases, audits of Recovery Act funds did not identify or report findings\n\nExamples of audit findings relating to financial management practices identified in audits of Recovery Act funds \ninclude the following - In California, the State Auditor found that cash management practices were not in \ncompliance with federal rules in the state's Weatherization Assistance Program - The Illinois Office of Internal Audit \nreported on the failure of state agencies to minimize the time between drawdowns of federal funds and expenditure \nof those funds and failure to charge hours worked to the proper federal grant at one agency\n\n- In Iowa, auditors found that a local school district possibly commingled Recovery Act funds with other school \ndistrict revenue, which led to the replacement of the district's accounting supervisor\n\n- In New Jersey, an audit of the Weatherization Assistance Program found inadequate policies and controls in place \nto ensure that federal\n\nRecovery Act financial reporting was properly completed, supported by adequate documentation, and reviewed by \na supervisor prior to submission\n\n- In Ohio, the Auditor of the State identified deficiencies related to unallowable expenditures and inadequate cash \nmanagement in some programs funded through the Recovery Act\n\nExamples of audit findings relating to program compliance with laws and regulations that were identified in various \naudits of Recovery Act funds include the following - In Arizona, Single Audits found that the Arizona Department of \nEducation failed to have current central contractor registrations on file prior to awarding Recovery Act ESEA Title I \ngrants to LEAs but have developed a corrective action plan to correct these findings\n\n- In Colorado, a local government audit revealed that some Federal Transit Formula Grant funds had been spent \nwithout a check on whether the vendor had been suspended or debarred from participating in federal programs\n\n- In Florida, state auditors found that the program officials were unable to document that certain individuals were \neligible for Medicaid benefits as required by law, and that their procedures did not ensure that all health care \nproviders receiving Medicaid payments had provider agreements in effect\n\n- In Massachusetts, the state auditors found that the actual number of youths being reported as participating in the \nstate's WIA summer jobs program was overstated, that the calculation of job numbers needed to be monitored \nmore closely, and that compliance with participation levels needed to be reviewed\n\n- In Michigan, the Single Audit of the Medicaid program found that the Michigan Department of Community Health \ndid not fully monitor its Medicaid payments to ensure that such claims are paid promptly\n\nFailure to comply with the \"prompt pay\" requirements could result in Michigan not being eligible to receive increased \nFMAP for certain claims\n\n- In Mississippi, auditors found many instances of noncompliance with recipient reporting requirements. In these \ncases, state agencies were not providing clear and consistent guidance to subrecipients\n\nRecovery Act 181The State Accounting Office also provided the training to several universities and technical \ncolleges\n\n- In North Carolina, the state auditor's office found that a state department did not consistently perform effective \nmonitoring to ensure that subrecipients of Recovery Act funds were in compliance with Davis-Bacon wage-rate \nrequirements\n\n- In Texas, the Single Audit for fiscal year 2009 identified program weaknesses in determining eligibility in Medicaid, \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program\n\n\n\nIn addition to audits of Recovery Act funds, several states took steps to strengthen their accountability efforts to \nhelp to ensure appropriate uses of Recovery Act funds by implementing new work groups or entities to help \nmanage and oversee Recovery Act-funded programs. In addition, these new entities have helped state and local \ngovernments address the new requirements associated with Recovery Act funding, coordinate efforts among the \naccountability community, and inform the public. Other activities performed by these entities included maintaining a \nRecovery Act Web site, providing technical assistance, tracking the use of funds, issuing advisories, conducting \ntraining on internal controls, and providing assistance with recipient reporting. Examples of such activities are as \nfollows - In California, the Recovery Task Force meets regularly with state agencies receiving Recovery Act funds, \nmaintains a Recovery Act Web site as a central repository of information, and has issued more than 30 Recovery \nAct bulletins providing instructions and guidelines to state agencies. Also, the Recovery Act Inspector General \npublished an advisory which included steps to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with contract terms \nand to reduce the potential of fraud\n\n- In Georgia, the State Accounting Office launched an internal control initiative to enhance accountability for \nRecovery Act funds that began in June 2010 and provided internal control training to 28 state agencies.181 More \nspecifically, these agencies completed a self- assessment tool covering internal controls in areas such as financial \nreporting, revenue, and Recovery Act funds\n\nRecovery Act - In Massachusetts, the City of Boston contracted auditor is developing a computerized worksheet in \nwhich Recovery Act fund recipients will submit their reporting data in a standardized format that will be centrally \nstored at the City Auditor's office. According to city officials, this will make the managing of subrecipients and the \nreporting process easier and more efficient\n\n- In New Jersey, the Recovery Accountability Task force is responsible for monitoring the distribution of Recovery \nAct funds in the state and promoting the effective and efficient use of those funds. The task force discusses issues \nrelated to the oversight of Recovery Act funds and receives updates from state agencies to ensure funds are \ndispersed with the goals of the Recovery Act in mind\n\n- In New York, the Governor created a Stimulus Oversight Panel which meets biweekly to examine the use of \nRecovery Act funds by each of the 22 state agencies designated to receive them. In addition to other \nresponsibilities, individual panel members also conduct reviews and audits in their areas of expertise\n\n- In North Carolina, the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment (OERI) tracks, monitors, and reports on \nRecovery Act funds and works with state agencies on corrective action plans to help resolve Recovery Act-related \nfindings. OERI also conducted several technical assistance seminars around the state and provides resources such \nas webinars and checklists on its Web site to help agencies comply with Recovery Act requirements\n\n- In Pennsylvania, the Governor appointed the Chief Accountability Officer to help oversee reporting and \ntransparency for Recovery Act activities of state agencies. For the quarter ending June 30, 2010, the office filed \n371 recipient reports on behalf of state agencies and posted them to the state's Recovery Act Web site\n\n- In Texas, the Governor's Stimulus Working Group, which includes representatives from state agencies receiving \nsignificant amounts of Recovery Act funding, is a vehicle for sharing information. This group has been used to \ninform state agencies about recipient reporting requirements, help focus auditing and monitoring efforts, and \naddress program concerns\n\nRecovery Act 182The states and the District of Columbia have varying definitions and procedures relating to \ncompetition and contract types. Therefore, we relied on state and local officials to verify whether a particular \ncontract was awarded competitively and considered to be fixed-price under state or local contracting definitions and \nprocedures\n\n183In some instances, state officials further identified these contracts as having fixed-unit pricing arrangements, \nwhere, according to state officials, unit prices for contract items are fixed, but total quantities of items may vary, if \nneeded. Some officials characterized this type of arrangement as fixed-price, while others reported that it was \n\n\n\nother-than- fixed- price. As such, contracts with fixed-unit pricing arrangements are included in both the fixed-price \nand other-than-fixed-price totals identified in this section of the report\n\nObservations on States' Use of Contracts and Contract Outcomes During our Recovery Act reviews, we tracked \nand observed 208 contracts awarded by state and local governments. While this is a small number of contracts, our \nobservations indicate that state and local governments receiving Recovery Act funds reported that they are \ngenerally using competition and fixed-price contracts, and are not facing major issues with cost, schedule, or \ncontractor performance\n\nState and Local Recovery Act Contracts Generally Are Reported to Use Competition and Fixed- Price \nArrangements Between July 2009 and March 2010, we selected and subsequently analyzed contracts from a \nvariety of programs and held discussions with state and local officials to gain an understanding of the extent to \nwhich they believe contracts were awarded competitively and used pricing structures, particularly fixed-price \ncontracts, which reduced the government's financial risk.182 The use of competition is generally considered a \nfundamental tenant of public procurement. In addition, fixed- price contracting generally places the maximum \namount of risk on the contractor because the government pays a fixed price even if actual costs of the product or \nservice exceed the contract price. Of the 208 contracts we reviewed, 86 percent were reported by state and local \nofficials as being competed and 79 percent were reported as fixed- price contracts.183 Further, in five states all of \nthe contracts we reviewed were reported as being competed, and in four states all of the contracts we reviewed \nwere reported as being fixed-price contracts. Almost all contracts for highway projects were reported as \ncompeted, and all public housing contracts as fixed-price. Table 12 shows the number of contracts reported by \nofficials as being competed and awarded with fixed prices in the various programs we are monitoring across the \nselected states\n\nRecovery Act 184See GAO, Recovery Act Contracting Approaches and Oversight Used by Selected Federal \nAgencies and States, GAO-10-809 (Washington, D.C.

For instance, \nofficials reported that, for several contracts, the contractors provided a unique service and were the only source \navailable. In another instance, officials said that the state was granted a waiver of some competition requirements \nin order to, in part, expedite the delivery of goods and services. Officials also gave various reasons why some \ncontracts were not awarded as fixed-price contracts\n\nFor instance, officials reported that, for many contracts, fixed- price contracts were not used because use of \nanother contract type was the agency's standard practice for a particular type of project. In other cases, officials \nstated that other contract types enabled the program to award a contract and begin performance faster than a fixed- \nprice contract would\n\nAs part of our overall body of work on the Recovery Act, in July 2010 we reported on the level of insight and \noversight regarding the use of noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts in 5 of the 16 states covered in our bimonthly \nreviews California, Colorado, Florida, New York, and Texas.184 We found that the five states varied on the type \nand amount of data routinely collected on noncompetitive Recovery Act contracts and that the states do not \nroutinely provide state-level oversight of contracts awarded\n\nRecovery Act 185For the purposes of the report, we considered state-level oversight as centralized state \ngovernment offices with purview over more than one state agency or department. This included each governor's \noffice and state controller offices\n\n\n\n186We were unable to determine whether overall costs had increased, decreased, or remained the same for four \ncontracts. In addition, we were unable to determine whether the schedule had increased, decreased, or remained \nthe same for three contracts\n\nat the local level, where a portion of Recovery Act contracting occurs.185 According to state officials, they were \ngenerally following the contracting policies and practices for awarding and overseeing contracts that were in place \nprior to passage of the Recovery Act. Officials from the selected states' audit organizations said that if they were to \naddress Recovery Act contracting issues, it could be done through the annual Single Audit or other reviews of \nprograms that involve Recovery Act funds\n\nMajority of State and Local Recovery Act Contracts Are Reported to Be on Cost and Schedule and Performing \nSatisfactorily Between March and June 2010, we followed up with state and local officials to understand whether \nthe contracts we had selected were achieving the key acquisition outcomes of delivering on cost, on schedule, and \nwith satisfactory performance. State and local officials reported that most of the Recovery Act contracts we \nreviewed are meeting these goals\n\nAccording to state and local officials, of the 208 contracts we reviewed, 51 percent had no change to overall \ncontract cost, 12 percent had decreased costs, and 1 percent had changes to cost and prices but remained within \nthe contracts' total cost permitted. Approximately one-third of the contracts reported cost increases. In addition, \nofficials reported that 52 percent of contracts had no change to schedule and 11 percent delivered early. The \nremaining 36 percent of contracts reported schedule delays\n\nThirty-six percent-or 74 contracts-had no changes to either cost or schedule.186 Table 13 shows the number of \ncontracts reported by officials as having cost or schedule changes by the various programs we are monitoring \nacross the selected states\n\nRecovery Act Table 13 Number of Contracts Officials Reported as Having Cost or Schedule Changes, by Program \nArea as of June 2010 Program area Total contracts reviewed Contracts reportingno cost orschedule changes \nContracts reporting increased costs Contracts reporting decreased costs Contracts reporting schedule delay \nContracts reportingearly delivery Public Housing Authority 55 12 23 4 27 3 Highway programs-state level 52 7 20 \n13 23 15 Weatherization 27 18 4 0 7 0 Workforce Investment Act Youth Program-local level 19 9 3 4 6 1 Highway \nprograms-local project 16 4 10 1 5 1 Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965- local \nlevel 15 13 0 1 0 1 Transit programs 12 5 7 0 4 1 Other 12 6 3 1 3 0 Total 208 74 70 24 75 22 Source GAO analysis \nof data reported by state and local officials\n\nNote Some contracts fell into more than one category, so figures do not total across each program\n\nFor three-quarters of the 70 contracts where price increased, state and local officials attributed these increases to \nconditions that were not anticipated at the time of contract award. For example, officials reported that total costs \nincreased by over $300,000 for one public housing project because materials containing asbestos were found on \nboilers, which had to be taken apart to remove asbestos before they could be demolished, and several boilers \nintended to be repaired or reused needed to be replaced instead. The most common factors state and local officials \npointed to for schedule delays were circumstances beyond the control of the contractor and conditions not \nanticipated at the time of contract award. For instance, in several cases, officials noted that severe weather caused \nschedule delays\n\nAccording to state and local officials, 91 percent of the contracts we reviewed had no contractor work performance \nissues that adversely impacted the work being performed or deliverables being provided. Only\n\nRecovery Act 187For three contracts, officials did not provide any response regarding contractor performance \nissues, and for two contracts officials responded that they \"don't know.\" 188GAO, Recovery Act States' and \nLocalities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address Implementation Challenges and Bolster Accountability, \nGAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C. May 26, 2010)\n\n\n\n189See appendix IV for a complete list of population and unemployment rates for the selected local governments\n\n14 of 208 contracts we reviewed reported that there had been issues with contractor performance.187 Of those, \nseven were highway construction projects at the state and local level and three of the contracts were for public \nhousing projects. While the nature of these issues varied, in most cases officials reported that the contractor was \nable to satisfactorily continue or complete the project. In some of these cases, the contractor was assessed fees to \ncompensate for the contractor's performance issues\n\nOfficials reported only two instances where the contractor ceased to perform the remaining work, which will now be \nperformed by another contractor or the agency's staff\n\nLocal Governments' Use of Recovery Act Funds For this report, we continue our focus on the use of Recovery Act \nfunds at the local government level while updating our review of states' uses of Recovery Act funds in proposed and \nenacted budgets. As shown in figure 32, we visited 24 local governments in our 16 selected states and the District \nto collect information regarding their use of Recovery Act funds\n\nSimilar to the approach taken for our May 2010 report,188 we identified localities representing a range of types of \ngovernments (cities and counties), population sizes, and economic conditions (unemployment rates greater and \nless than the state's overall unemployment rate). We balanced these criteria with other considerations, including \nother scheduled Recovery Act work, local contacts established during prior reviews, and the geographic proximity of \nthe local government entities Officials from the 24 local governments we interviewed ranged in population from 258 \nin Steward, Illinois, to approximately 2.5 million in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Unemployment rates in our \nselected localities ranged from 6.7 percent in Round Rock, Texas, to 13.4 percent in Redding, California.189\n\nRecovery Act Figure 32 Selected Local Governments Included in Our September 2010 Review Local Governments \nContinue to Use Recovery Act Funds to Initiate One- Time Projects, Provide Services, and Support Staff, While \nFiscal Challenges Persist Local officials reported their governments' continued use of Recovery Act funds in a \nrange of program areas such as public safety (Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)), energy (EECBG), housing (Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-\nhousing Program (HPRP) and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)), and transportation and transit. Other \nRecovery Act funds received by the selected localities include grants for lead mitigation, wastewater treatment, and \nairport improvement. Some examples of the uses of Recovery Act funds appear in table 14\n\nFigure 32 depicts a United States map. The locations that GAO teams visited in order to collect information about \nlocal governments' use of Recovery Act funds are marked and identified on the map. Cities are marked with black \ndots and counties are marked as the outline of the county area. The following cities and counties were visited - In \nArizona, GAO visited the City of Phoenix - In California, GAO visited the Cities of Redding and San Jose - In \nColorado, GAO visited the City of Colorado Springs and Weld County - In Florida, GAO visited Miami-Dade County \n- In Georgia, GAO visited the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County and Columbus Consolidated \nGovernment - In Illinois, GAO visited the Cities of Chrisman and Steward - In Iowa, GAO visited the Cities of Des \nMoines and Marshalltown - In Massachusetts, GAO visited the City of Boston - In Michigan, GAO visited the City of \nFarmington Hills - In Mississippi, GAO visited the City of Tupelo - In New Jersey, GAO visited Jersey City - In New \nYork, GAO visited the City of Brookhaven and Steuben County - In North Carolina, GAO visited the City of \nWilmington - In Ohio, GAO visited the City of Cincinnati - In Pennsylvania, GAO visited the City of Philadelphia and \nBerks County - In Texas, GAO visited the Cities of Austin and Round Rock\n\nRecovery Act Table 14 Selected Examples of Local Governments' Uses of Recovery Act Funds Recovery Act grant \nLocal government receiving funds Examples of local use of funds Grants-in-Aid for Airports Phoenix, AZ The \nPhoenix Aviation Department obligated approximately $10.4 million in Grants- in-Aid for Airports funds to construct \nTaxiway C at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to improve traffic flow\n\nLead-Based Paint Hazard Control Program Marshalltown, IA The City of Marshalltown was awarded approximately \n$2.6 million to fund lead- mitigation efforts, including eliminating lead-based paint, repainting affected homes, \nreplacing leaded windows, and housing citizens affected by renovations in temporary quarters\n\n\n\nHighway Infrastructure Investment grant Wilmington, NC Wilmington received a $4 million highway surface \ntransportation grant to construct a multiuse trail linking key city resources and providing access to shopping, \nrecreational, cultural, and educational destinations. The grant is expected to allow the city to complete 75 percent of \nthe trail by 2011. The city had previously estimated completion by 2030 without federal funding\n\nRetrofit Ramp-Up Austin, TX The City of Austin was awarded $10 million for use of the Retrofit Ramp- Up program \n(part of the EECBG program) which may provide alternative financing options for property owners to make energy-\nefficiency improvements to their property, such as installing solar panels and roof water heating mechanisms. \nAlternative financing options include new financing mechanisms, interest rate buy-downs, and on-bill repayment\n\nAustin city officials said they are coordinating with the City of San Antonio, which also received competitive EECBG \nfunds\n\nSource GAO analysis of local governments' reported use of funds\n\nSeveral local government officials said that Recovery Act funds were used for projects including purchase of law \nenforcement and transit equipment and investment in public works and infrastructure projects such as road and \nsewer improvements. For example, Redding, California, officials said Federal Transit Administration Recovery Act \nfunds helped the Redding Area Bus Authority (RABA) accelerate the purchase of three new buses and nine new \nparatranist vans, thus allowing RABA to avoid implementing service cuts and fare increases. Officials in Farmington \nHills, Michigan, reported using Recovery Act funds from the JAG program to purchase a range of public safety \nequipment, such as radio equipment, digital camcorders, undercover transmitters, and a Digital Eyewitness Media \nManager Server System that otherwise would not have been purchased\n\nOfficials in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, reported using Recovery Act funds from the Clean Water State \nRevolving Fund program to help construct four sewer inceptors. Columbus, Georgia, officials said they were using \nRecovery Act funds to enhance the implementation of transportation projects including the construction of a \nbike/pedestrian trail and streetscape improvements\n\nRecovery Act The use of Recovery Act funds also helped several local governments continue to provide local \nservices. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, officials said that the use of Recovery Act funds from the COPS Hiring \nRecovery Program (CHRP) grant helped support community policing and crime prevention efforts by allowing the \ncity to hire 50 additional police officers Similarly, officials in Colorado Springs, Colorado, reported using Recovery \nAct funds from the JAG program to fund the salaries of community service officers. Officials in Austin, Texas, \nreported using Recovery Act funds from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program to fund 12 \nnew emergency dispatchers. With regard to local services provided, officials in Weld County, Colorado, and Boston, \nMassachusetts, reported using Recovery Act funds from the Congregate Nutrition Services program to provide \nmeal deliveries to low-income senior citizens. Officials in Berks County, Pennsylvania, said the county would not \nhave been able to provide rent and utility assistance to persons at risk of becoming homeless without Recovery Act \nfunds from the HPRP grant\n\nIn most localities we visited, government officials reported working in partnership with other local entities, such as \nnonprofit organizations, the private sector, transit authorities, and other local jurisdictions to apply for or administer \nRecovery Act funds. For example, officials in Round Rock, Texas, said the city partnered with the Capital Area \nMetropolitan Planning Organization to apply for a Transit Capital Assistance Recovery Act grant\n\nThe application was successful with Round Rock receiving $2 million to construct a transit facility consisting of bus \nlanes, a transit pavilion, bicycle racks, and more than 100 parking spaces. Officials in Marshalltown, Iowa, reported \nthat the city worked extensively with partners from surrounding counties, educational institutions, and other \nagencies to administer funds for the Lead- Based Paint Hazard Control Program. In Miami-Dade County, Florida, \nthe local officials said the county partnered with private commercial farmers to administer Recovery Act funds from \nthe National Clean Diesel Assistance Program. This program provided $2 million to farmers to purchase \napproximately 300 more efficient diesel motors used in portable and fixed irrigation equipment\n\n\n\nMost local governments we contacted for this review reported experiencing fiscal challenges due to revenue \ndeclines or reductions in state aid. In Jersey City, New Jersey, officials said the city faces an $80 million budget \ndeficit and an estimated $27.5 million reduction in state aid for fiscal year 2011. Officials in Steuben County, New \nYork, reported a decline in all categories of revenue receipts and state funding cuts of $858,000. Officials also \nnoted that delays in state reimbursements have resulted in substantial use of county reserves. Officials in Miami-\nDade\n\nRecovery Act County, Florida, said a decrease in property and sales tax revenue combined with a reduction in \nstate funding contributed to a $426 million budget gap for 2010. Officials in San Jose and Redding, California, also \ncited budget gaps for the current fiscal year and reductions in revenue from property taxes and other sources as \nexamples of their governments' fiscal challenges. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, officials said their fiscal condition \nhas slightly improved due to an unanticipated 4 percent increase in 2010 sales tax revenue over actual 2009 \nrevenue. Despite this increase, Colorado Springs is not planning to expand services in 2010. Officials from the city \nof Austin reported an increase in sales tax revenue and declines in other revenue sources, such as fees and \ncharges for commercial and residential development. Specifically, Austin, Texas, officials reported a 3.2 percent \nsales tax revenue increase and anticipate using this revenue to help address the city's budget gap of between $11 \nmillion and $28 million\n\nOfficials in several localities reported that they are developing plans to continue funding Recovery Act programs \nusing local government funds or by pursuing other funds after Recovery Act funding ends. For example, Cincinnati, \nOhio, officials said the city hopes to continue funding the 50 police officers hired under the 3-year CHRP grant by \nusing city revenues to cover expenditures after 2012. Officials in Wilmington, North Carolina, reported that the city \nintends to replace JAG funding for law enforcement equipment and services with general funds and other grant \nfunds. San Jose, California, officials said the city plans to pursue other grant opportunities in order to continue \nfunding city infrastructure projects currently benefiting from the use of Recovery Act funds. In contrast, officials in a \nnumber of localities said that because Recovery Act funds were primarily used for one-time projects they do not \nneed to develop a specific plan to prepare for the end of Recovery Act funding. For example, officials in Farmington \nHills, Michigan, reported that the city used Recovery Act funds for one-time expenditures, such as equipment \npurchases and energy-efficiency upgrades, and therefore does not need to develop an exit strategy. Similarly, in \nTupelo, Mississippi, officials said the city used Recovery Act funds for infrastructure-related, \"stand-alone\" projects \nrequiring minimal or no long-term financial support and specifically avoided applying for a CHRP grant because of \nthe requirement to retain officers hired under the grant after Recovery Act funding ends. A few local governments \nreported that they plan to end Recovery Act-funded projects or reduce staff or funding for these programs after \nRecovery Act funding ends\n\nRecovery Act 190Not all jurisdictions have the same fiscal year. Most of the states we visited have fiscal years \nbeginning July 1, with the following exceptions New York's fiscal year begins on April 1; the fiscal year for Texas \nbegins on September 1; and the fiscal year for the District of Columbia and Michigan begins on October 1\n\nStates' Use of Recovery Act Funds for Programs and Services Continues to Prevent Deeper Budget Cuts Recovery \nAct funds continued to help states maintain services in areas such as education, health care, and transportation. A \nfew states reported that they recently received additional Recovery Act funding in other areas\n\nFor example, New Jersey received $8 million for an energy rebate program and $14 million for energy-efficiency \nprograms. Michigan received $30 million in Recovery Act funds to provide energy- efficiency retrofits for residential, \ncommercial, industrial, and public buildings. Many of our selected states, as well as the District, reported that the \nRecovery Act continues to have a positive effect on their fiscal stability. As an example, Arizona state officials told \nus that Recovery Act funds helped their state through the worst part of the recession by preventing deeper cuts in \nsocial programs, and giving officials breathing room to figure out what fiscal steps to take in the long term. Officials \nin Ohio credit the over $7.9 billion in Recovery Act funds they have received as of August 1, 2010, with helping to \nprotect jobs and continue services in their state. Officials in Illinois and the District said that they would be in more \ndire fiscal condition without SFSF and the increased FMAP funds from the Recovery Act. In Iowa, Recovery Act \nfunds received in fiscal year 2011 helped officials balance their fiscal year 2011 budget while avoiding tax increases \n\n\n\nand reducing the amount by which officials needed to draw down the state's reserve fund. Recovery Act funds also \nreduced the need in Massachusetts to use more of the state's authorized fiscal year 2010 rainy- day reserve funds \nto balance the budget, according to state officials. City officials told us that Recovery Act funds helped the District \nmaintain a balanced budget for fiscal year 2011 without tapping into the city's rainy- day fund\n\nSeveral states and the District contacted for this review reported that they incorporated measures to prepare for \nthe end of Recovery Act funding in their fiscal year 2011 budget or in budgets in prior cycles.190 For example, in \nMississippi officials told us the legislature sharply reduced spending to offset reductions in Recovery Act funding. \nAccording to city officials, the District's fiscal year 2010 budget, as well as the mayor's proposed fiscal year 2011 \nbudget, reflects the reduction in revenues that will result from the reduction in Recovery Act funds in fiscal year \n2011. Officials in some states reported they were planning for the end of Recovery Act funding\n\nFor example, Florida officials told us they were in the early stages of\n\nRecovery Act 191National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers, The Fiscal \nSurvey of States (Washington, D.C., June 2010). The survey is based on survey responses from all 50 states' \ngovernors' budget offices collected from March through May 2010\n\ndeveloping their fiscal year 2012 budget which will include a plan to address the phasing out of Recovery Act funds. \nAccording to Michigan officials, they have made some structural changes such as reforms to the public school \nemployees' retirement plan and are working to devise solutions for when the Recovery Act funds run out in fiscal \nyear 2012. In Georgia, officials said they are preparing for the cessation of Recovery Act funds by planning \nadditional budget reductions. They also are projecting moderate revenue growth. New York officials told us that \nthey will address the phasing out of Recovery Act funds this fall when they develop the budget for the next fiscal \nyear\n\nState officials reported mixed assessments of changes to their states' fiscal conditions since we contacted them for \nour May 2010 report. Officials in several states noted that they continue to face difficult budget challenges\n\nSeveral states told us that their fiscal condition has generally remained the same since our May report. Some \nstates have seen signs that their fiscal condition is shifting and showing signs of improvement. For example, state \nofficials reported that tax revenue collections in Massachusetts during the last 2 months of fiscal year 2010 were \nabove revenue estimates by $191 million and $149 million respectively, and the commonwealth ended fiscal year \n2010 with tax collections above budget estimates. State officials in Pennsylvania also reported that revenues were \n$58 million ahead of estimates in June-the first month since December 2007 that revenues exceeded estimates. \nArizona officials also told us that their April and May revenues were much better than they had projected, however, \nthey noted that the trend did not continue in June and July. In another example, Michigan officials told us that in \nJune 2010, total wage and salary employment was up 23,400 jobs compared to June 2009. This was the first year-\nover-year increase in total wage and salary employment in Michigan since March 2005. These signs of \nimprovement, in contrast to revenue declines, are consistent with national trends reported in the June 2010 Fiscal \nSurvey of States issued by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget \nOfficers.191 According to the Fiscal Survey, states are projecting a slight rise of 3.9 percent in tax collections for \nfiscal year 2011 recommended budgets relative to fiscal year 2010 estimates. However, states estimate that their \n2010 tax revenues will represent an almost 12 percent decline in states' sales, personal\n\nRecovery Act 192GAO, Recovery Act As Initial Implementation Unfolds in States and Localities, Continued \nAttention to Accountability Issues Is Essential, GAO-09-580 (Washington, D.C.

Lastly, we update the status of our Matters for Congressional Consideration\n\nDepartment of Transportation New Recommendations To ensure that Congress and the public have accurate \ninformation on the extent to which the goals of the Recovery Act are being met, we recommend that the Secretary \nof Transportation direct FHWA to take the following two actions\n\nRecovery Act - Develop additional rules and data checks in the Recovery Act Data System, so that these data will \naccurately identify contract milestones such as award dates and amounts, and provide guidance to states to revise \nexisting contract data\n\n- Make publicly available-within 60 days after the September 30, 2010, obligation deadline-an accurate accounting \nand analysis of the extent to which states directed funds to economically distressed areas, including corrections to \nthe data initially provided to Congress in December 2009\n\nOpen Recommendations To better understand the impact of Recovery Act investments in transportation, we believe \nthat the Secretary of Transportation should ensure that the results of these projects are assessed and a \ndetermination made about whether these investments produced long-term benefits\n\nSpecifically, in the near term, we recommend the Secretary direct FHWA and FTA to determine the types of data \nand performance measures they would need to assess the impact of the Recovery Act and the specific authority \nthey may need to collect data and report on these measures\n\nAgency Actions In its response, DOT noted that it expected to be able to report on Recovery Act outputs, such as \nthe miles of road paved, bridges repaired, and transit vehicles purchased, but not on outcomes, such as reductions \nin travel time, nor did it commit to assessing whether transportation investments produced long-term benefits. DOT \nfurther explained that limitations in its data systems, coupled with the magnitude of Recovery Act funds relative to \noverall annual federal investment in transportation, would make assessing the benefits of Recovery Act funds \ndifficult. DOT indicated that, with these limitations in mind, it is examining its existing data availability and, as \nnecessary, would seek additional data collection authority from Congress if it became apparent that such authority \nwere needed. While we are encouraged that DOT plans to take some steps to assess its data needs, it has not \ncommitted to assessing the long-term benefits of Recovery Act investments in transportation infrastructure. We are \ntherefore keeping our recommendation on this matter open\n\nOpen Recommendation The Secretary of Transportation should gather timely information on the progress they are \nmaking in meeting the maintenance-of-effort requirement and to report preliminary information to Congress within \n60 days of the certified period (September 30, 2010), (1) on whether states met required program expenditures as \noutlined in their maintenance-of- Recovery Act effort certifications, (2) the reasons that states did not meet these \ncertified levels, if applicable, and (3) lessons learned from the process\n\n\n\nAgency Actions DOT concurred in part with our March 2010 recommendation that it gather and report more timely \ninformation on the progress states are making in meeting the maintenance-of-effort requirements. Because more \ntimely information could better inform policymakers' decisions on the usefulness and effectiveness of the \nmaintenance-of-effort requirements and is important to assessing the impact of Recovery Act funding in achieving \nits intended effect of increasing overall spending, we are leaving this recommendation open and plan to continue to \nmonitor DOT's actions\n\nIn its August 2010 response, DOT officials stated that DOT will encourage states to report preliminary data for the \ncertified period ending September 30, 2010, and deliver a preliminary report to Congress within 60 days of the \ncertified period. DOT officials said they have developed a timeline for obtaining information to produce this report \nand will issue guidance by October 1, 2010, requesting that states update actual aggregate expenditure data and \nprovide the data to DOT by November 15, 2010. DOT officials said they will use this information to develop the \nreport to Congress, and it will submit the report no later than November 30, 2010\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development New Recommendation Because the absence of third-party \ninvestors reduces the amount of overall scrutiny TCAP projects would receive and HUD is currently not aware of \nhow many projects lacked third-party investors, HUD should develop a risk-based plan for its role in overseeing \nTCAP projects that recognizes the level of oversight provided by others\n\nDepartment of Labor Open Recommendations To enhance Labor's ability to manage its Recovery Act and regular \nWIA formula grants and to build on its efforts to improve the accuracy and consistency of financial reporting, we \nrecommend that the Secretary of Labor take the following actions\n\nRecovery Act - To determine the extent and nature of reporting inconsistencies across the states and better target \ntechnical assistance, conduct a one-time assessment of financial reports that examines whether each state's \nreported data on obligations meet Labor's requirements\n\n- To enhance state accountability and to facilitate their progress in making reporting improvements, routinely \nreview states' reporting on obligations during regular state comprehensive reviews\n\nAgency Actions Labor agreed with both of our recommendations and has begun to take some actions to implement \nthem. To determine the extent of reporting inconsistencies, Labor plans to conduct an assessment of state \nfinancial reports to determine if the data reported is accurate and reflects Labor's guidance on reporting of \nobligations and expenditures. After the assessment, Labor plans to provide technical assistance to states that need \nfurther instruction and guidance. To enhance states' accountability and facilitate their progress in making \nimprovements in reporting, Labor has instructed all its regional offices to begin routinely reviewing state's \nreporting on obligations during state comprehensive reviews. In addition, Labor plans to issue guidance on the \ndefinitions of key financial terms such as obligations, provide online training to ensure that the terms are accurately \nand consistently applied, and conduct workshops on financial and administrative management\n\nOpen Recommendation Our September 2009 bimonthly report identified a need for additional federal guidance in \ntwo areas- measuring the work readiness of youth and defining green jobs -and we made the following two \nrecommendations to the Secretary of Labor - To enhance the usefulness of data on work readiness outcomes, \nprovide additional guidance on how to measure work readiness of youth, with a goal of improving the comparability \nand rigor of the measure\n\n- To better support state and local efforts to provide youth with employment and training in green jobs, provide \nadditional guidance about the nature of these jobs and the strategies that could be used to prepare youth for \ncareers in green industries\n\nRecovery Act Agency Actions Labor agreed with both of our recommendations and has begun to take some actions \nto implement them. With regard to the work readiness measure for WIA Youth summer employment activities, \nLabor issued guidance on May 13, 2010 for the WIA Youth Program that builds on the experiences and lessons \nlearned during implementation of Recovery Act- funded youth activities in 2009. Labor broadly identified some \n\n\n\nadditional requirements for measuring work readiness of youth that it plans to address in future guidance. This \nincludes having the employer observe and assess workplace performance and determine what worksite skills are \nnecessary to be successful in the workplace\n\nRegarding our recommendation on the green jobs, Labor told us that the Bureau of Labor Statistics published a \nFederal Register Notice on March 16, 2010 for comment on a proposed definition for measuring green jobs, which \nincludes an approach for identifying environmental industries and counting associated jobs. Labor officials hope this \nwill inform state and local workforce development efforts to identify and target green jobs and their training needs. \nIn addition, Labor is using the Recovery Act-funded green jobs training grants to document lessons learned on \ndesigning and providing green jobs training\n\nDepartment of Energy Open Recommendations Given the concerns we have raised about whether program \nrequirements are being met, we recommend that DOE, in conjunction with both state and local weatherization \nagencies, develop and clarify weatherization program guidance that - establishes best practices for how income \neligibility should be determined and documented and issues specific guidance that does not allow the self-\ncertification of income by applicants to be the sole method of documenting income eligibility\n\n- clarifies the specific methodology for calculating the average cost per home weatherized to ensure that the \nmaximum average cost limit is applied as intended\n\n- accelerates current DOE efforts to develop national standards for weatherization training, certification, and \naccreditation, which is currently expected to take 2 years to complete\n\nRecovery Act - develops a best practice guide for key internal controls that should be present at the local \nweatherization agency level to ensure compliance with key program requirements\n\n- sets time frames for development and implementation of state monitoring programs\n\n- revisits the various methodologies used in determining the weatherization work that should be performed based \non the consideration of cost-effectiveness and develops standard methodologies that ensure that priority is given to \nthe most cost- effective weatherization work. To validate any methodologies created, this effort should include the \ndevelopment of standards for accurately measuring the long-term energy savings resulting from weatherization \nwork conducted\n\n- considers and addresses how the weatherization program guidance is impacted by the introduction of increased \namounts of multifamily units\n\nIn addition, given that state and local agencies have felt pressure to meet a large increase in production targets \nwhile effectively meeting program requirements and have experienced some confusion over production targets, \nfunding obligations, and associated consequences for not meeting production and funding goals, we recommend \nthat DOE clarify its production targets, funding deadlines, and associated consequences while providing a balanced \nemphasis on the importance of meeting program requirements\n\nAgency Actions In our May 2010 report, we provided eight recommendations and raised concerns about whether \nprogram requirements were being met. DOE generally agreed with all of our recommendations and has begun to \ntake several steps in response. For example, DOE reported that it has drafted national workload standards to \naddress our concerns regarding training, certification, and accreditation. DOE plans to issue these standards to \nrecipients in October 2010. DOE is still in the process of considering our recommendations and will provide \nadditional information on how they plan to fully implement our recommendations at a later date\n\nRecovery Act Environmental Protection Agency Open Recommendation We recommend that the EPA \nAdministrator work with the states to implement specific oversight procedures to monitor and ensure subrecipients' \ncompliance with the provisions of the Recovery Act-funded Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF program\n\n\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, EPA provided additional guidance to the states regarding their \noversight responsibilities, with an emphasis on enhancing site specific monitoring and inspections. Specifically, in \nJune 2010, the agency developed and issued an oversight plan outline for Recovery Act projects that provides \nguidance on the frequency, content, and documentation related to regional reviews of state Recovery Act programs \nand regional and state reviews of specific Recovery Act projects\n\nFor example, EPA's guidance states that regions and states should be reviewing the items included on the EPA \n\"State ARRA Inspection Checklist\" or use a state equivalent that covers the same topics. The plan also describes \nEPA headquarters role in ongoing Recovery Act oversight and plans for additional webcasts. EPA also reiterated \nthat contractors are available to provide training and to assist with file reviews and site inspections\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Office of Head Start Our May 2010 bimonthly report identified the need \nfor improved management information on regional offices and grantees' decisions and activities to consistently \noversee the rapid expansion and program performance of Head Start and Early Head Start under the Recovery Act\n\nWe made three recommendations to the Director of the Office of Head Start (OHS), part of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families. In May, HHS disagreed with our conclusion \nthat a lack of management information limits its ability to consistently oversee the rapid expansion of Head Start \nand Early Head Start under the Recovery Act. We provided a draft of all materials related to Head Start and Early \nHead Start to OHS and HHS for comment, but they did not provide comments in time for us to consider them in this \nreport\n\nOpen Recommendation To provide grantees with appropriate guidelines on their use of Head Start and Early Head \nStart grant funds, and enable OHS to monitor the use of these funds, the Director of OHS should direct regional \noffice staff to stop allocating all grant funds to the \"other\" budget category, and immediately\n\nRecovery Act revise all financial assistance awards (FAAs) in which all funds were allocated to the \"other\" category\n\nOpen Recommendation To facilitate understanding of whether regional decisions regarding waivers of the \nprogram's matching requirement are consistent with Recovery Act grantees' needs across regions, the Director of \nOHS should regularly review waivers of the nonfederal matching requirement and associated justifications\n\nOpen Recommendation To oversee the extent to which grantees are meeting the program goal of providing \nservices to children and families and to better track the initiation of services under the Recovery Act, the Director of \nOHS should collect data on the extent to which children and pregnant women actually receive services from Head \nStart and Early Head Start grantees\n\nDepartment of Treasury New Recommendation Treasury should expeditiously provide HFAs with guidance on \nmonitoring project spending and develop plans for dealing with the possibility that projects could miss the spending \ndeadline and face further project interruptions\n\nExecutive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget (OMB) New Recommendation To strengthen \nthe Single Audit and federal follow up as oversight accountability mechanisms, we recommend that the Director of \nOMB (1) shorten the timeframes required for issuing management decisions by federal awarding agencies to grant \nrecipients, and (2) issue the OMB Circular No. A-133 Compliance Supplement no later than March 31 of each year\n\nOpen Recommendation To leverage Single Audits as an effective oversight tool for Recovery Act programs, in our \nprior bimonthly reports, we recommended that the Director of OMB should\n\nRecovery Act 193The Compliance Supplement is issued annually to guide auditors on what program requirements \nshould be tested for programs audited as part of the Single Audit\n\n1\n\n\n\nprovide more direct focus on Recovery Act programs through the Single Audit to help ensure that smaller programs \nwith higher risk have audit coverage in the area of internal controls and compliance; 2\n\ntake additional efforts to provide more timely reporting on internal controls for Recovery Act programs for 2010 and \nbeyond; and 3\n\nevaluate options for providing relief related to audit requirements for low-risk programs to balance new audit \nresponsibilities associated with the Recovery Act\n\n4\n\nissue Single Audit guidance in a timely manner so that auditors can efficiently plan their audit work; and 5\n\nexplore alternatives to help ensure that federal awarding agencies provide their management decisions on the \ncorrective action plans in a timely manner\n\nAgency Actions OMB has taken several steps in response to our recommendations. Its efforts, however, are \nongoing, and further actions are needed to fully implement our recommendations to help mitigate risks related to \nRecovery Act funds. We include a summary of OMB's efforts to implement these recommendations\n\nTo focus auditor risk assessments on Recovery Act-funded programs and to provide guidance on internal control \nreviews for Recovery Act programs, OMB worked within the framework defined by existing mechanisms-Circular \nNo. A-133 and the Circular No. A-133 Compliance Supplement (Compliance Supplement).193 In this context, OMB \nhas made limited adjustments to its Single Audit guidance. OMB issued the Compliance Supplement in May 2009, \nwhich focused risk assessments on Recovery Act-funded programs. In August 2009, OMB issued the Circular No. \nA-133 Compliance Supplement Addendum I, which provided additional guidance for auditors and modified the \nCompliance Supplement to, among other things, focus on new Recovery Act programs and new program clusters\n\nIn October 2009, OMB began a Single Audit Internal Control Project (project), which is nearing its completion as of \nMay 14, 2010. One of the project's goals is to encourage auditors to identify and communicate significant \ndeficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over\n\nRecovery Act compliance for selected major Recovery Act programs 3 months sooner than the 9-month time frame \ncurrently required under OMB Circular No. A- 133. OMB plans to analyze the results to identify the need for \npotential modifications to improve OMB guidance related to Single Audits\n\nAlthough OMB noted the increased responsibilities falling on those responsible for performing Single Audits, it has \nyet to issue proposals or plans to address this issue. States that volunteered to participate in the project were \neligible for some relief in their workloads because OMB modified the requirements under Circular No. A- 133 to \nreduce the number of low-risk programs for inclusion in the Single Audits\n\nOpen Recommendation To provide more direct focus on Recovery Act programs through the Single Audit with \nregard to smaller programs with higher risk, OMB provided guidance in the 2009 OMB Circular No. A-133 \nCompliance Supplement that required auditors to consider all federal programs with expenditures of Recovery Act \nawards to be considered higher risk programs when performing the standard risk-based tests for selection of \nprograms to be audited. OMB also issued clarifying information on determining risk for programs with Recovery Act \nexpenditures. However, since most of the funding for Recovery Act programs will be expended in 2010 and beyond, \nwe remain concerned that some smaller programs with higher risk would not likely receive adequate audit \ncoverage. One approach for OMB to consider in helping to ensure that smaller programs with higher risk have audit \ncoverage is to explore various options to provide auditors with the flexibility needed to select programs that are \nconsidered high risk, even though the federal expenditures for a smaller program may be less than the expenditure \nthreshold provided under the Single Audit Act\n\nWith regard to taking additional efforts to provide more timely reporting on internal controls for Recovery Act \nprograms for 2010 and beyond, OMB has not yet put into place measures to achieve earlier communication of the \n\n\n\nreporting of internal control deficiencies for fiscal years 2010 and beyond-years where considerable amounts of \nRecovery Act funds will be expended. OMB officials have stated in August 2010, that they plan to initiate a \nsubsequent Single Audit Internal Control Project for fiscal year 2010. Similar to the 2009 project, one of the project's \ngoals will be to encourage more timely identification and earlier communication of internal control deficiencies in \nselected programs expending Recovery Act funding\n\nRecovery Act OMB designed its Single Audit Internal Control Project to grant some relief to the auditors for the \nstates that volunteered to encourage participation in the project. Specifically, participating auditors were not \nrequired to perform risk assessments of smaller federal programs. OMB had also modified the requirements under \nCircular No. A- 133 to reduce the number of low-risk programs that must be included in some project participants' \nSingle Audits. Although the project which began in October 2009, was designed to provide the auditors some relief \nin their workload, many auditors had already completed their risk assessment for audits with fiscal years ending \nJune 30, 2009. As a result, the auditors did not experience the audit relief intended by the project\n\nWith regard to issuing Single Audit Guidance in a timely manner, we reported in May 2010 that OMB officials told \nus that they had planned to issue the Compliance Supplement in late May 2010. However, OMB did not issue the \nCompliance Supplement until July 29, 2010. Several of the auditors that we surveyed stated that they needed the \ninformation as early as February, or at least by April, to effectively plan their work. OMB officials stated that the \ndelay in issuing the 2010 compliance supplement was primarily due to the additional attention needed to include \nmore Recovery Act programs in the Compliance Supplement and information regarding the audit procedures for \nreviewing Recovery Act reporting requirements. In May 2010, OMB provided the American Institute of Certified \nPublic Accountants (AICPA) Governmental Audit Quality Center and the National Association of State Auditors, \nComptrollers and Treasurers (NASACT) with draft Single Audit guidance in May 2010\n\nAICPA and NASACT posted the draft to its Web sites for auditors to use for planning their work. However, some \nauditors we spoke with stated that because the guidance was not in a final form, it still impacted their ability to \nefficiently plan and conduct their work. In addition, OMB has stated that it plans to have a second phase of the \nSingle Audit Internal Control Project for fiscal year 2010. However, as of August 5, 2010, OMB had not yet defined \nthe parameters of the project and issued guidance for potential volunteer participants. OMB also has not provided \ndetailed guidance that would explain incentives for volunteering to participate in the project, types of entities that will \nbe permitted to participate, the scope of the project (including the specific programs that participants could select \nfrom), the number of participants it is seeking, or the timeframes for beginning and ending the project\n\nOMB officials have stated that they have discussed alternatives for helping to ensure that federal awarding \nagencies provide their management decisions on the corrective action plans in a timely manner but have yet to\n\nRecovery Act decide on the course of action that they will pursue to implement this recommendation\n\nOpen Recommendation As we noted in our July 2009 report, reporting on Recovery Act performance results is \nbroader than the employment-related reporting required by the act. We continue to recommend that the Director of \nOMB-perhaps through the Senior Management Councils-clarify what other program performance measures \nrecipients are expected to report on to demonstrate the impact of Recovery Act funding\n\nMatters for Congressional Consideration Matter To the extent that appropriate adjustments to the Single Audit \nprocess are not accomplished under the current Single Audit structure, Congress should consider amending the \nSingle Audit Act or enacting new legislation that provides for more timely internal control reporting, as well as audit \ncoverage for smaller Recovery Act programs with high risk\n\nGAO continues to believe that Congress should consider changes related to the Single Audit process\n\nMatter To the extent that additional coverage is needed to achieve accountability over Recovery Act programs, \nCongress should consider mechanisms to provide additional resources to support those charged with carrying out \nthe Single Audit Act and related audits\n\n\n\nGAO continues to believe that Congress should consider changes related to the Single Audit process\n\nMatter To provide housing finance agencies (HFA) with greater tools for enforcing program compliance, in the event \nthe Section 1602 Program is extended for another year, Congress may want to consider directing Treasury to \npermit HFAs the flexibility to disburse Section 1602 Program funds as interest-bearing loans that allow for \nrepayment\n\nGAO continues to believe that Congress should consider directing Treasury to permit HFAs the flexibility to \ndisburse Section 1602 Program funds as interest-bearing loans that allow for repayment\n\nRecovery Act We are sending copies of this report to the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments \nof Health and Human Services (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), Education, Transportation, Energy, \nand Housing and Urban Development.

Apr. 23, 2009)\n\nAppendix I Methodology Appendix I Objectives, Scope, and Methodology This appendix describes our objectives, \nscope, and methodology for this seventh of our bimonthly reviews on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nof 2009 (Recovery Act). A detailed description of the criteria used to select the core group of 16 states and the \nDistrict of Columbia (District) and programs we reviewed is found in appendix I of our April 2009 Recovery Act \nbimonthly report.1 Objectives and Scope The Recovery Act specifies several roles for GAO, including conducting \nbimonthly reviews of selected states' and localities' use of funds made available under the act. As a result, our \nobjectives for this report were to assess (1) selected states' and localities' uses of and planning for Recovery Act \nfunds, (2) the approaches taken by the selected states and localities to ensure accountability for Recovery Act \nfunds, and (3) state activities to evaluate the impact of the Recovery Act funds they have received to date\n\nWe selected programs for review primarily because they have begun disbursing funds to states or because they \nhave known or potential risks\n\nThe risks can include existing programs receiving significant amounts of Recovery Act funds or new programs. In \nsome cases, we have also collected data from all states and from a broader array of localities to augment the in-\ndepth reviews\n\nhttp://www.gao.gov/\n\n\nOur teams visited the 16 selected states, the District, and a nonprobability sample of entities (e.g., state and local \ngovernments, local educational agencies, public housing authorities) during the period from May 2010 through \nSeptember 2010. As with our previous Recovery Act reports, our teams met with a variety of state and local \nofficials from executive-level and program offices. During the discussions with state and local officials, teams used \na series of program review and semistructured interview guides that addressed state plans for management, \ntracking, and reporting of Recovery Act funds and activities. We also reviewed state statutes, legislative proposals, \nand other state legal materials for this report. Where attributed, we relied on state officials and other state sources \nfor descriptions and interpretation of state legal materials. Appendix IV details the states and localities visited by \nGAO. Criteria used to select localities within our selected states follows below\n\nRecovery Act 2Recovery Act, div. A, 1512, 123. We will refer to the quarterly reports required by Section 1512 as \nrecipient reports\n\n3GAO, Recovery Act Recipient Reported Jobs Data Provide Insights into Use of Recovery Act Funding, but Data \nQuality and Reporting Issues Need Attention, GAO-10-223 (Washington, D.C. Nov. 19, 2009)\n\n4The Recovery Act requires recipients of funding from federal agencies to report quarterly on jobs created or \nretained with Recovery Act funding. The first recipient reports filed in October 2009 cover activity from February \nthrough September 30, 2009. This bimonthly report incorporates recipient reports covering activity through June \n30, 2010\n\nThe act requires that nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act- funded grants, contracts, or loans submit quarterly \nreports on each project or activity including information concerning the amount and use of funds and jobs created \nor retained.2 The first of these recipient reports covered cumulative activity since the Recovery Act's passage \nthrough the quarter ending September 30, 2009. The Recovery Act requires us to comment on the estimates of jobs \ncreated or retained after the recipients have reported\n\nWe issued our initial report related to recipient reporting, including recommendations for recipient report \nimprovements, on November 19, 2009.3 A second major focus of the current report is to provide updated \ninformation concerning recipient reporting in accordance with our mandate for quarterly reporting.4 States' and \nLocalities' Uses of Recovery Act Funds Using criteria described in our earlier bimonthly reports, we selected the \nfollowing streams of Recovery Act funding flowing to states and localities for review during this report Medicaid \nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) grant awards; the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF); Title I, \nPart A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA); Parts B and C of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA); the Federal-Aid Highway Surface Transportation and Transit Capital Assistance \nprograms; the State Energy Program (SEP); the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program \n(EECBG); the Weatherization Assistance Program; the Public Housing Capital Fund; the Tax Credit Assistance \nProgram (TCAP); and Grants to States for Low- Income Housing Projects in Lieu of Low-Income Housing Credits \nProgram under Section 1602 of the Recovery Act (Section 1602 Program). We also reviewed how Recovery Act \nfunds are being used by states and localities\n\nIn addition, we analyzed www.Recovery.gov data on federal spending\n\nRecovery Act 5We stratified the population into strata based on size and urban status. Regarding size, we identified \nthe 100 largest LEAs in the country. The 33 geographic districts comprising the New York City Public Schools were \ntreated as one school district and that one district was placed in the 100 largest LEAs stratum\n\nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage To examine Medicaid enrollment, states' efforts to comply with the \nprovisions of the Recovery Act, states' uses of the grant awards, and other related information, we conducted a \nWeb-based survey, asking the 16 states and the District to provide new information, as well as to update \ninformation they had previously provided to us. To establish the reliability of our Web-based survey data, we \npretested the survey with Medicaid officials in two states and also conducted follow-up with sample states as \nneeded. For the increased FMAP grant awards, we obtained increased FMAP grant and draw down figures for each \nstate in our sample and the District from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). We discussed with \n\nhttp://www.recovery.gov/\n\n\nCMS issues related to the agency's oversight of increased FMAP grant awards and its guidance to states on \nRecovery Act provisions\n\nTo assess the reliability of increased FMAP draw down figures, we previously interviewed CMS officials on how \nthese data are collected and reported. Based on these steps, we determined that the data provided by CMS and \nsubmitted by states were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our engagement\n\nSFSF, ESEA Title I, and IDEA To obtain national level information on how Recovery Act funds made available by \nthe U.S. Department of Education under SFSF, ESEA Title I, and IDEA were used at the local level, we designed \nand administered a Web-based survey of local education agencies (LEAs) in the 50 states and the District of \nColumbia. We surveyed school district superintendents across the country to learn how Recovery Act funding was \nused and what impact these funds had on school districts. We conducted our survey between March and April \n2010, with a 78 percent final weighted response rate. We selected a stratified5 random sample of 575 LEAs from \nthe population of 16,065 LEAs included in our sample frame of data obtained from Education's Common Core of \nData (CCD) in 2007-08\n\nWe took steps to minimize nonsampling errors by pretesting the survey instrument with officials in 5 LEAs in \nJanuary and February 2010. Because we surveyed a sample of LEAs, survey results are estimates of a population \nof LEAs and thus are subject to sampling errors that are associated with samples of this size and type. Our sample \nis only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. As each sample could\n\nRecovery Act have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular \nsample's results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 10 percentage points). We excluded 16 of \nthe sampled LEAs for various reasons - because they were no longer operating in the 2009-10 school year, were a \nduplicate entry, or were not an LEA - and therefore were considered out of scope. All estimates produced from the \nsample and presented in this report are representative of the in-scope population and have margins of error of plus \nor minus 7 percentage points or less for our sample, unless otherwise noted\n\nTo obtain specific examples of how LEAs are using Recovery Act funds, we selected LEAs in each of the following \nstates California, Massachusetts and Michigan to visit and interview LEA officials. We selected these states from \namong the 16 states and the District of Columbia in our review based on geographic diversity and varying state \nbudget situations for K-12 education\n\nWithin the selected states, we identified a mix of local districts that would represent urban, rural, and suburban \ndistricts, LEAs among the 100 largest LEAs as well as districts that were not as large, and local districts with \ndifferent budget situations. We also obtained selected additional information from LEA officials in New York. In \naddition to interviewing local officials, we interviewed selected state officials. Specifically, we interviewed ESEA Title \nI officials in states with relatively low Recovery Act Title I drawdown rates to assess to what extent state officials in \nthese states are monitoring LEA obligations and also discussed implementation of School Improvement Grants. We \nalso interviewed officials at the U.S\n\nDepartment of Education (Education) and reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and communications to the states. \nFurther, we obtained information from Education's website about the amount of funds these states have drawn \ndown from their accounts with Education. We also reviewed data on state level funding changes from the National \nAssociation of State Budget Officers (NASBO). To assess the reliability of the NASBO data, we (1) reviewed \nexisting documentation related to the data sources and (2) interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about the \ndata. We determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report\n\nRecovery Act Federal-Aid Highway Surface Transportation Program For highway infrastructure investment, we \nreviewed status reports and guidance to the states and discussed these with the U.S. Department of \nTransportation and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) officials. We obtained funding data for each of the 16 \nstates and the District in our review. We also reviewed data related to contracts and economically distressed areas-\nsubmitted by states-in the FHWA Recovery Act Data System (RADS) for completeness and compliance with FHWA \nguidance\n\n\n\nWe also interviewed or obtained information from state department of transportation officials in Arizona, California, \nFlorida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas\n\nSpecifically, we discussed rates of deobligations in suballocated and nonsuballocated areas, accuracy of contract \ndata entered into RADS, and rates of spending from regular FHWA highway program during the period of the \nRecovery Act\n\nTransit Capital Assistance Program For public transit investment, we reviewed status reports and guidance to the \nstates and transit agencies and discussed these with U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Transit \nAdministration (FTA) officials as part of our review of the Transit Capital Assistance Program and Fixed Guideway \nInfrastructure Investment program. We obtained funding data on the amounts of funding transferred from FHWA to \nFTA and funding levels used for transit operating expenses for each of our urbanized and nonurbanized areas. We \nalso interviewed FTA officials about operating expense data. Finally we interviewed or obtained information from \nstate and transit agency officials in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Texas regarding \nthese issues\n\nRecovery Act 6For SEP, the six states we collected information from are Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, New \nYork, and Pennsylvania. For EECBG, the 12 states we collected information from are Arizona, California, Colorado, \nFlorida, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas\n\n7The nine states we collected information from are Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New York, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, and Texas\n\n8The states we visited are Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Masschusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, \nPennsylvania, and Texas\n\nState Energy Program, Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant, and Weatherization Assistance Program For \nthe State Energy Program (SEP), the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program (EECBG), and \nWeatherization Assistance Program, we reviewed relevant regulations and federal guidance and interviewed \nDepartment of Energy officials who administer the programs at the federal level. Specifically, for the SEP and the \nEECBG programs, we collected information from 6 and 12 of our selected states and the District, respectively.6 \nAlso, we conducted semistructured interviews of officials in state and local agencies that administer the programs \nand with local subrecipients who received Recovery Act funds\n\nThese interviews covered the respective state's and locality's usage of funds, internal controls, and reporting \nprocedures. We also collected data on the number and types of projects funded with Recovery Act money for the \nSEP and EECBG programs. In addition, for this report, we collected updated information from seven of our \nselected states and the District on their weatherization programs.7 We conducted semistructured interviews of \nofficials in the states' agencies that administer the weatherization program and with local service providers \nresponsible for weatherization production. We interviewed officials at local service providers in the District and the \nseven states, and reviewed local agencies' client case files for homes weatherized with Recovery Act funds. We \nalso conducted site visits to interview local providers of weatherization and to observe weatherization activities. For \nall three programs, we collected data about each state's total allocation under the Recovery Act, as well as the \nallocation already provided to the states and the obligations and expenditures-to-date Public Housing Capital Fund \nFor public housing, we obtained data from HUD's Electronic Line of Credit Control System on the amount of \nRecovery Act funds that have been obligated and expended by each housing agency in the country that received \nPublic Housing Capital Funds. To monitor progress on how housing agencies are using these funds, we visited 12 \nhousing agencies in nine states.8 For each state, we selected at least 1 public housing agency\n\nRecovery Act from a list of 47 housing agencies visited for previous Recovery Act reports to update the status of \ntheir grant projects. At the selected housing agencies, we interviewed housing agency officials and conducted site \nvisits of Recovery Act projects. We also interviewed officials of the U.S\n\n\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to follow up on HUD's efforts in monitoring public housing \nagency obligations and uses of Recovery Act funds and to understand HUD's capacity to administer Recovery Act \nfunds. Further, we interviewed HUD officials to understand their procedures for reviewing data that housing \nagencies reported to FederalReporting.gov\n\nTax Credit Assistance Program To further assess state implementation of the Tax Credit Assistance Program \n(TCAP) and Section 1602 program, we asked managers of state housing finance agencies in all 50 states, the \nDistrict, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to complete a Web survey. Our questionnaire asked about \nthe status of program delivery, program design, safeguards and controls, expected results, and challenges to \nimplementation. We designed and tested the self-administered questionnaire in consultation with experts, \nrepresentatives of housing finance stakeholders, and state agency managers. Survey data collection took place in \nNovember and early December of 2009. We received usable responses from all 54 agencies\n\nWhile all state agencies returned questionnaires, and thus our data is not subject to sampling or overall \nquestionnaire nonresponse error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce other errors in our \nfindings. We took steps to minimize errors of measurement, question-specific nonresponse, and data processing. In \naddition to the questionnaire development activities listed above, and pretesting the questionnaire with four state \nagency officials before the survey, GAO analysts also recontacted selected respondents to follow up on answers \nthat were missing or that required clarification. In addition, GAO analysts resolved respondent difficulties in \nanswering our questions during the survey. Before the survey, we also contacted each agency to determine \nwhether our originally identified respondent was the most appropriate and knowledgeable person to answer our \nquestions, and made changes to our contact list as necessary. Finally, analysis programs and other data analyses \nwere independently verified\n\nRecovery Act Head Start and Early Head Start Owing to the focus on Early Head Start expansion under the \nRecovery Act, we visited nine Early Head Start expansion grantees in four states Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, \nand Ohio. Due to time and resource considerations, we chose these states based on GAO staff expertise in Head \nStart. For each state, all but one Early Head Start grantee selected had received a grant above the median for all \nRecovery Act expansion funds awarded in each state in order to focus our limited resources on relatively sizable \ngrants. We also included four grantees that had been awarded expansion funds for constructing or renovating \nfacilities. The grantees we visited included grantees that had not previously provided an Early Head Start program \nbut that had provided Head Start, as well as experienced Early Head Start grantees. For each selected grantee, we \nreviewed federal assistance award information, enrollment data, proposals for the use of Quality Improvement \nfunds, and facilities under construction or renovation. We conducted structured interviews with grantee officials \ncovering updates on the use of Recovery Act funds, challenges to spending funds within Office of Head Start \n(OHS) deadlines, OHS monitoring of grantees, and grantees' interpretation of enrollment and attendance \nrequirements. We also reviewed files on-site at each grantee on enrollment, income eligibility, and health screening. \nThe grantees we visited were purposefully chosen and are not a representative sample of all expansion grantees. \nThe information gathered from these site visits is not generalizable to the population of Early Head Start expansion \ngrantees\n\nRecipient Reporting The recipient reporting section of this report responds to the Recovery Act's mandate that \nwe comment on the estimates of jobs created or retained by direct recipients of Recovery Act funds. For our review \nof the fourth submission of recipient reports, covering the period from April 1, 2010, through June 30, 2010, we \nbuilt on findings from our three prior reviews of the reports, covering the period from February 2009 through March \n30, 2010. We performed edit checks and basic analyses on the fourth submission of recipient report data that \nbecame publicly available at Recovery.gov on July 30, 2010. We interviewed federal agency officials from the \nDepartment of Energy, who have responsibility for ensuring a reasonable degree of quality across their programs' \nrecipient reports. We also interviewed representatives from a variety of state associations, such as the National \nAssociation of State Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers and the National Association of State Budget Officers, \nto obtain their views on whether the process of recipient reporting has had an effect on intergovernmental \ninteractions\n\n\n\nRecovery Act 9The 2010 OMB Circular No. A-133 Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit \nOrganizations Compliance Supplement was issued on July 29, 2010\n\nFrom the fourth submission of recipient reports, we reviewed reports for two energy programs, EECBG and the \nWeatherization Assistance Program, to determine whether they had used Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB) guidance for calculating their full-time equivalents (FTE) funded by the Recovery Act. We interviewed 13 \nEECBG state-level and 19 local government recipients from our 17 selected jurisdictions about their FTE \ncalculations for the fourth round of reporting. We also interviewed 8 state- level weatherization assistance \nrecipients and 17 local government weatherization assistance subrecipients from our 17 selected jurisdictions about \ntheir FTE calculations. In some instances, we reviewed supporting documentation with quarterly FTE reports, and \nassessed the validity of those calculations in complying with OMB guidance. Due to the limited number of recipients \nreviewed and the judgmental nature of the selection, GAO's FTE findings are not generalizable beyond the \nprograms examined\n\nIn addition, state teams also interviewed government officials from our 16 selected states and the District to discuss \nissues that arose in the fourth reporting period statewide, specifically related to any difficulties they encountered \nduring the fourth round of reporting, development of their state Web sites, and their views on whether the recipient \nreporting requirements have affected intergovernmental interactions. We also asked these officials about ongoing \nstate plans for managing, tracking, and reporting on Recovery Act funding and activities and solicited feedback \nfrom state officials regarding how states are using data generated from the recipient reporting effort and ways the \nrecipient reporting process could be improved\n\nSingle Audit as an Accountability and Oversight Mechanism To perform our audit work, we interviewed federal \nofficials, state auditors, and officials from the cognizant agency for audit from the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS). We examined documents related to Single Audits, including the 2010 OMB Circular No. A-133 \nAudits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations Compliance Supplement,9 OMB's and HHS's \nevaluations of the OMB Single Audit Internal Control project, and related federal agency management decisions. \nWe reviewed Federal Audit Clearinghouse documents, such as selected Single Audit reports. We also conducted a \nsurvey of the state auditors and state program and finance officials that participated in the OMB Internal Control \nSingle Audit Project. We analyzed and summarized\n\nRecovery Act 10For additional information about our survey and our analysis of responses, see Recovery Act \nStates' and Localities' Uses of Funds and Actions Needed to Address Implementation Challenges and Bolster \nAccountability, GAO-10-604 (Washington, D.C. May 26, 2010)\n\nWe conducted our surveys in March 2010 and interviewed several state auditors, officials from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, which is the cognizant agency for audit, and officials from awarding federal agencies \nwhose programs were selected for audit under the project. We also participated in an OMB-led discussion of the \nproject's participants to obtain their views on the project\n\nthe responses to our survey.10 Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board Initiatives To determine the status \nand results of oversight activities of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (the Board), we met with \nrepresentatives of the Board to discuss the initiatives they have taken to coordinate and monitor the efforts of the \ninspectors' general oversight activities as well as the Board's initiatives to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and \nabuse of Recovery funds. We reviewed available documentation related to the Board's efforts\n\nObservations on States' Use of Contracts and Contract Outcomes To provide observations on selected states' use \nof competitive procedures and fixed prices in awarding contracts for Recovery Act funds, between July 2009 and \nMarch 2010, we met with state and local officials to discuss the contract award process for a sample of 208 \ncontracts in 16 states and the District. Between March and June 2010, we met again with the officials responsible \nfor these same contracts to discuss the extent to which there had been cost or schedule changes or contractor \nperformance issues. The contracts we reviewed with state officials were selected based on a combination of \n\n\n\nseveral factors to obtain a mix of various programs and dollar values that varied among the states. Our \nmethodology for selecting these contracts does not allow for reported information to be generalized\n\nState and Local Accountability To assess actions taken by the state and local audit community to monitor the use of \nRecovery Act funds, we have interviewed selected state and local auditors and state inspectors general about their \nongoing and planned audit activities. We have also reviewed state and local audit reports. We have also spoken to \nsome of the Recovery Act oversight entities created in many of the selected states such as New Jersey's Recovery \nAccountability Task Force and the Recovery Task Force in\n\nRecovery Act California. In addition, in an effort to update the audit community concerning our Recovery Act work \nand participate in information sharing about Recovery Act issues, we are working with state and local auditors and \ntheir associations to facilitate routine telephone conference calls to discuss Recovery Act issues with a broad \ncommunity of interested parties\n\nThe conference call participants include the Association of Government Accountants; the Association of Local \nGovernment Auditors; the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers; OMB; the Board; \nfederal inspectors general; the National Governors Association; and the National Association of State Budget \nOfficers. In an effort to ensure information sharing about allegations of fraud, we are also working with state and \nlocal auditors to develop plans for routine sharing of information\n\nState and Local Budget We continued our review of the use of Recovery Act funds for the 16 selected states, the \nDistrict, and selected localities. We conducted interviews with state budget officials and reviewed proposed and \nenacted budgets and revenue forecasts to update our understanding of the use of Recovery Act funds in the 16 \nselected states and the District. To update our understanding of local governments' use of Recovery Act funds, we \nmet with finance officials and city administrators at the selected local governments\n\nThe topics covered in our meetings included what Recovery Act funds the states and localities received, how they \nused the funds, and their exit strategy to prepare for the phasing out of Recovery Act funding. In the course of our \ndiscussions with officials we explored the extent to which the receipt of Recovery Act funds has stabilized state and \nlocal government budgets. We also reviewed reports and analyses regarding the fiscal conditions of states and \nlocalities\n\nThe selected states and the District for our review contain about 65 percent of the U.S. population and are \nestimated to receive collectively about two-thirds of the intergovernmental grant funds available through the \nRecovery Act. To select local governments for our review, we identified localities representing a range of \njurisdictions (cities and counties) and variations in population sizes and economic conditions (unemployment rates \ngreater than or less than the state's overall unemployment rate). In making our selections, we also considered \nproximity to our other scheduled Recovery Act work and local contacts established during prior reviews. The GAO \nteams visited a total of 24 local governments in our 16 selected states that ranged in population from\n\nRecovery Act 11See appendix IV, for a complete list of population and unemployment rates for the selected local \ngovernments\n\napproximately 258 in Steward, Illinois, to approximately 2.5 million in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Unemployment \nrates in our selected localities ranged from 6.7 percent in Round Rock, Texas, to 13.4 percent in Redding, \nCalifornia.11 Due to the small number of jurisdictions visited and judgmental nature of their selection, GAO's \nfindings are not generalizable to all local governments\n\nThe list of local governments selected in each state is found in appendix IV\n\nData and Data Reliability We collected funding data from www.Recovery.gov and federal agencies administering \nRecovery Act programs for the purpose of providing background information. We used funding data from            \nwww.Recovery.gov- which is overseen by the Board-because it is the official source for Recovery Act spending. \nExcept as may be noted with regard to specific analyses appearing in other sections of this report and based on \n\nhttp://www.recovery.gov/\nhttp://www.recovery.gov-/\n\n\nour examination of this information thus far, we consider these data sufficiently reliable with attribution to official \nsources for the purposes of providing background information on Recovery Act funding for this report. Our sample \nof states, localities, and entities has been purposefully selected and the results of our reviews are not generalizable \nto any population of states, localities, or entities\n\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 27, 2010, to September 20, 2010, in accordance with generally \naccepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nsufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit \nobjectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions \nbased on our audit objectives\n\nRecovery Act 1GAO, Recovery Act As Initial Implementation Unfolds in States and Localities, Continued Attention \nto Accountability Issues Is Essential, GAO-09-580 (Washington, D.C.

Projects in areas currently lacking documentation showing that \nthe areas meet the criteria to be designated as economically distressed should be reported as a project in a \nnoneconomically distressed area\n\nAgency Actions In July 2010, FHWA directed Arizona, California, and Illinois to revise their designations and to \nreport these projects as being in noneconomically distressed areas. FHWA also directed all states to ensure that \nfuture Recovery Act Data System entries be coded as economically distressed only if FHWA division and \nheadquarters offices had approved the designation\n\nRecovery Act Implemented Recommendation Recipients of highway and transit Recovery Act funds, such as state \ndepartments of transportation and transit agencies, are subject to multiple reporting requirements. Both DOT and \nOMB have issued implementation guidance for recipient reporting. Despite these efforts, state and local highway \nand transit officials expressed concerns and challenges with meeting the Recovery Act reporting requirements. We \nrecommended in our September 2009 report that the Secretary of Transportation should continue the department's \noutreach to state departments of transportation and transit agencies to identify common problems in accurately \nfulfilling reporting requirements and provide additional guidance, as appropriate\n\nAgency Actions In September 2009, in responding to our recommendation, DOT said that it had conducted \noutreach, including providing technical assistance, training, and guidance to recipients, and will continue to assess \nthe need to provide additional information. For example, in February 2010, FTA continued three training webinars to \nprovide technical assistance in complying with reporting requirements under section 1201(c) of the Recovery Act. \n\n\n\nIn addition, on February 1, 2010, FTA issued guidance to transit agencies instructing them to use the same \nmethodology for calculating jobs retained through vehicles purchased under section 1201 as they had been for the \nrecipient reporting. This reversed previous guidance that had instructed transit agencies to use a different \nmethodology for vehicle purchases under sections 1201 and recipient reporting\n\nImplemented Recommendation DOT and FHWA have yet to provide clear guidance regarding how states are to \nimplement the Recovery Act requirement that economically distressed areas (EDA) are to receive priority in the \nselection of highway projects for funding. We found substantial variation both in how states identified EDAs and \nhow they prioritized project selection for these areas\n\nTo ensure states meet Congress's direction to give areas with the greatest need priority in project selection, we \nrecommended in our July 2009 report that the Secretary of Transportation develop clear guidance on identifying \nand giving priority to EDAs that are in accordance with the requirements of the Recovery Act and the Public Works \nand Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, and more consistent procedures for FHWA to use in \nreviewing and approving states' criteria\n\nAgency Actions In August 2009, in response to our recommendation, FHWA, in consultation with the Department of \nCommerce, developed guidance that\n\nRecovery Act addresses our recommendation. In particular, FHWA's August 2009 guidance defines \"priority,\" \ndirecting states to give priority to projects that are located in an economically distressed area and can be completed \nwithin the 3-year time frame over other projects. In addition, FHWA's guidance sets out criteria that states may use \nto identify economically distressed areas based on \"special need.\" The criteria align closely with special need \ncriteria used by the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration in its own grant programs, \nincluding factors such as actual or threatened business closures (including job loss thresholds), military base \nclosures, and natural disasters or emergencies\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development Implemented Recommendation To ensure housing agencies use \nthe correct job calculation, we recommend that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development clearly \nemphasize to housing agencies that they discontinue use of the outdated jobs calculator provided by HUD in the \nfirst round of recipient reporting\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, HUD sent an e- mail to housing agencies on June 30, 2010, \nthat explicitly instructed them not to use the outdated jobs-counting calculator, as it was not correctly computing the \nFTE calculation per updated OMB guidance. This e-mail also included a link to HUD's new online jobs-counting \ncalculator and instructed housing agencies to use this calculator for the July and all future reporting periods\n\nImplemented Recommendation To help clarify the recipient reporting responsibilities of housing agencies and to \nimprove the consistency and completeness of jobs data reported by housing agencies, we recommend that the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development issue guidance that explains when FTEs attributable to \nsubcontractors should be reported by the prime recipient\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, HUD notified housing agencies in a June 30, 2010, e-mail that \nit had developed additional guidance for housing agencies to use when determining whether prime recipients \nshould report FTEs for subcontractors and provided a link to the guidance on its Web site. The guidance noted that \nhousing agencies should include Recovery\n\nRecovery Act Act-funded hours that contractors and subcontractors worked as part of their FTE calculation\n\nImplemented Recommendation To help HUD achieve Recovery Act objectives and address challenges with its \ncontinued administration of Recovery Act funds, we recommend that the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment develop a management plan to determine the adequate level of agency staff needed to administer \nboth the Recovery Act funds and the existing Capital Fund program going forward, including identifying future \nresource needs and determining whether current resources could be better utilized to administer these funds\n\n\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, HUD developed a management plan for administration of \nRecovery Act funds, including the need for an additional 11 FTEs to carry out Recovery Act responsibilities. In July \n2010, HUD also provided us with its management plan for the Public Housing Capital Fund program. The plan \nsummarized the key activities HUD undertakes to monitor and facilitate the use of these funds by program area, \nincluding rule and policy development, planning, program awards, program management, technical assistance, and \nreporting. The plan also included the specific activities, tasks, and resources used for each of these existing \nprogram areas, identifying approximately 91 existing FTEs in its headquarters and field offices to support these \nactivities. According to HUD's management plan, HUD's current staffing level is sufficient to manage its existing \nCapital Fund program, but the agency could more efficiently utilize its current resources. As a result, HUD plans to \nrealign current staff to focus on its core missions including Recovery Act responsibilities\n\nImplemented Recommendation We recommended on March 3, 2010 that the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment instruct housing agencies to discontinue use of the jobs calculator provided by HUD in the first round \nof recipient reporting for subsequent rounds of reporting to ensure the correct job calculation is used\n\nAgency Actions In a March 26, 2010, e-mail to housing agencies, HUD included instructions to discontinue use of \nthe jobs calculator originally posted on the HUD Recovery Act Web site in October 2009. HUD reiterated these \ninstructions in a subsequent e-mail it sent to housing agencies on March 31, 2010\n\nRecovery Act Implemented Recommendation To enhance HUD's ability to prevent, detect, and correct \nnoncompliance with the use of Recovery Act funds, we recommended in September 2009 that the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development expand the criteria for selecting housing agencies for on-site reviews to include \nhousing agencies with open Single Audit findings that may affect the use of and reporting on Recovery Act funds\n\nAgency Actions In October 2009, HUD expanded its criteria for selecting housing agencies for on-site reviews to \ninclude all housing agencies with open 2007 and 2008 Single Audit findings as of July 7, 2009, relevant to the \nadministration of Recovery Act funds. HUD has identified 27 such housing agencies and planned to complete these \non- site reviews by February 15, 2010\n\nDepartment of Education Implemented Recommendation To ensure that FTEs are properly accounted for over \ntime, we recommend that the Secretary of Education clarify how LEAs and IHEs should report FTEs when \nadditional Recovery Act funds are received in a school year and are reallocated to cover costs incurred in previous \nquarters, particularly when the definite term methodology is used\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, Education issued clarifying guidance on August 26, 2010, that \naddressed how FTEs should be reported when funds are expended in one quarter to cover costs incurred in \nprevious quarters\n\nImplemented Recommendation To ensure that subrecipients do not underreport vendor FTEs directly paid with \nRecovery Act funds, we recommend that the Secretary of Education re-emphasize the responsibility of \nsubrecipients to include hours worked by vendors in their quarterly FTE calculations to the maximum extent \npracticable\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, Education issued clarifying guidance on August 26, 2010, that \nre-emphasized the responsibility of subrecipients to include hours worked by vendors in their quarterly FTE \ncalculations\n\nRecovery Act Implemented Recommendation To improve consistency in how FTEs generated using the definite \nterm are calculated, we recommend that the Secretary of Education and the Director of OMB clarify whether IHE \nand LEA officials using this methodology should include the cost of benefits in their calculations\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, Education issued clarifying guidance on August 26, 2010, that \naddressed whether benefits should be included in the calculation of jobs under the OMB guidance released \nDecember 18, 2009\n\n\n\nImplemented Recommendation To improve the consistency of FTE data collected and reported, we recommend \nthat the Secretary of Education and the Director of OMB provide clarifying guidance to recipients on how to best \ncalculate FTEs for education employees during quarters when school is not in session\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, Education issued clarifying guidance on August 26, 2010, that \nexplained that the length of a full-time contract (i.e., 10 or 12 months) should not affect FTE calculations\n\nImplemented Recommendation We recommended in September 2009 that the Secretary of Education take further \naction such as collecting and reviewing documentation of state monitoring plans to ensure that states understand \nand fulfill their responsibility to monitor subrecipients of SFSF funds and consider providing training and technical \nassistance to states to help them develop and implement state monitoring plans for SFSF\n\nAgency Actions In February 2010, Education instructed states to submit to Education for review their plans and \nprotocols for monitoring subrecipients of SFSF funds. Education also issued its plans and protocols for monitoring \nstate implementation of the SFSF program. The plan includes on-site visits to about half the states and desk \nreviews of the other states to be conducted over the next year\n\nRecovery Act 2For more details on the maintenance-of-effort requirements, see GAO, Recovery Act Planned \nEfforts and Challenges in Evaluating Compliance with Maintenance of Effort and Similar Provisions, GAO-10-247 \n(Washington, D.C. Nov. 30, 2009)\n\nImplemented Recommendation We recommended in November 2009 that the Secretary of Education take further \naction to enhance transparency by requiring states to include an explanation of changes to maintenance-of-effort \nlevels in their SFSF funding application resubmissions.2 Agency Actions Education notified states that, if states \nmade changes to their maintenance-of-effort data in their State Fiscal Stabilization Fund applications, they must \nprovide a brief explanation of the reason the data changed\n\nDepartment of the Treasury Implemented Recommendation In order to increase the likelihood that state Housing \nFinance Agencies (HFA) will comply with Treasury's requirements for recapturing funds, the Secretary of the \nTreasury should define what it considers appropriate actions by HFAs to recapture funds in order to avoid liability \nwhen they are unable to collect funds from project owners that do not comply\n\nAgency Actions Treasury agreed with our recommendation and in response to our recommendation, Treasury \nprovided additional guidance to state HFAs to clarify what constitutes appropriate actions by HFAs to recapture \nfunds in order to avoid liability in the event of project owner noncompliance\n\nSpecifically, in August 2010, the agency developed and issued a Recapture Guidance for Recovery Act projects \nthat receive Section 1602 Program funds that defines a recapture event, specifies the amount of funds owed in the \nevent of recapture, describes an HFA's obligation and responsibilities in avoiding project owner noncompliance, \nsets forth the kinds of recapture actions an HFA may take in the event of noncompliance, and directs HFAs on how \nto report noncompliance\n\nRecovery Act 3OMB, Payments to State Grantees for Administrative Costs of Recovery Act Activities, M-09-18 \n(Washington, D.C., May 11, 2009), and OMB, Payments to State Grantees for their Administrative Costs for \nRecovery Act Funding - Alternative Allocation Methodologies, M-10-03 (Washington, D.C., Oct. 13, 2009)\n\nExecutive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Implemented Recommendation We \nwere concerned that since the scope of Single Audit workloads due to Recovery Act programs being subject to \nSingle Audits will increase, consideration should be given to determining what funds can be used to support Single \nAudit efforts related to Recovery Act programs, including whether legislative changes are needed to specifically \ndirect resources to cover incremental audit costs related to Recovery Act programs. We recommended that the \nDirector of OMB develop mechanisms to help fund the additional Single Audit costs and efforts for auditing \nRecovery Act programs\n\n\n\nAgency Actions OMB addressed our recommendation by issuing guidance3 to executive departments and agencies \nto help states with various approaches to recover administrative costs associated with the wide range of activities to \ncomply with the Recovery Act. Administrative costs include, but are not limited to, oversight and audit costs and the \ncosts of performing additional Single Audits. OMB issued the guidance to clarify actions (within the existing legal \nframework for identifying allowable reimbursable costs) that states could take to recover administrative costs in a \nmore timely manner\n\nIn addition to our recommendation to OMB, as we previously noted in our bimonthly reports, it is our view that, to \nthe extent that additional audit coverage is needed to achieve accountability over Recovery Act programs, \nCongress should consider mechanisms to provide additional resources to support those charged with carrying out \nthe Single Audit Act and related audits\n\nImplemented Recommendation We reported in July 2009 that OMB was encouraging communication of \nweaknesses to management early in the audit process, but did not add requirements for auditors to take these \nsteps. This step did not address our concern that internal controls over Recovery Act programs should be reviewed \nbefore significant funding is expended. Under the current Single\n\nRecovery Act 4The following 16 states elected to participate Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, \nLouisiana, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and \nVirginia\n\nAudit framework and reporting timelines, the auditor evaluation of internal control and related reporting will occur \ntoo late-after significant levels of federal expenditures have already occurred. As a result of our recommendation, \nOMB implemented a Single Audit Internal Control Project under which a limited number of voluntarily participating \nauditors performing the Single Audits for states would communicate in writing internal control deficiencies noted in \nthe single audit within 6 months of the 2009 fiscal year-end, rather than the 9 months required by the Single Audit \nAct. We recommended that the Director of OMB take steps to achieve sufficient participation and coverage in \nOMB's Single Audit Internal Control Project that provides for early written communication of internal control \ndeficiencies to achieve the objective of more timely accountability over Recovery Act funds\n\nAgency Actions OMB implemented its Single Audit Internal Control Project in October 2009. The project called for a \nminimum of 10 participants. OMB solicited the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam, from \nwhich 16 states volunteered to participate.4 The volunteer states were diverse in geographic characteristics and \npopulation and included states that use auditors within state government as well as external auditors to conduct \nSingle Audits. In addition, the volunteer states included California and Texas, which are among the top three states \nwith the highest levels of Recovery Act obligations from the federal government. Each state selected at least two \nRecovery Act programs from a list of 11 high- risk Recovery Act programs for internal control testing. OMB \ndesigned the project to be voluntary and OMB officials stated that, overall, they were satisfied with the population \nand geographic diversity among the states that volunteered\n\nAlthough the project's coverage could be more comprehensive to provide greater assurance over Recovery Act \nfunding, the results of the project could provide meaningful insight for making improvements to the Single Audit \nprocess\n\nImplemented Recommendation The Single Audit Act requires that recipients submit their financial reporting \npackages, including the Single Audit report, to the federal government no later than 9 months after the end of the \nperiod being\n\nRecovery Act audited. As a result, an audited entity may not receive feedback needed to correct an identified \ninternal control or compliance weakness until the latter part of the subsequent fiscal year. The timing problem is \nexacerbated by the extensions to the 9-month deadline that are routinely granted by the awarding agencies, \nconsistent with OMB guidance. We made two recommendations in this area. First, we recommended that the \nDirector of OMB formally advise federal cognizant agencies to adopt a policy of no longer approving extensions of \nthe due dates of Single Audit reporting package submissions beyond the 9-month deadline. Second, we also \n\n\n\nrecommended that the Director of OMB widely communicate this revised policy to the state audit community and \nothers who have responsibility for conducting Single Audits and submitting the Single Audit reporting package\n\nAgency Actions On March 22, 2010, OMB addressed these two recommendations by issuing memorandum M-10-\n14, Updated Guidance on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This guidance directed federal agencies \nto not grant any requests made to extend the Single Audit reporting deadlines for fiscal years 2009 to 2011. OMB \nfurther stated that to meet the criteria for a low- risk auditee in the current year, the auditee must have submitted the \nprior 2 years' audit reports by the required due dates. OMB communicated this revised policy though the OMB \nWeb site, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the National Association of State Auditors, \nComptrollers, and Treasurers\n\nImplemented Recommendation OMB should work with the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (the \nBoard) and federal agencies, building on lessons learned, to establish a formal and feasible framework for review of \nrecipient changes during the continual update period and consider providing more time for agencies to review and \nprovide feedback to recipients before posting updated reports on Recovery.gov\n\nAgency Actions In our March 3, 2010 report, we recommended that OMB work with the Board and federal agencies \nto establish a formal and feasible framework for review of recipient changes during the new continuous review \nperiod and consider providing more time for federal agencies to review and provide feedback to recipients before \nposting updated reports on Recovery.gov. On March 22, 2010, OMB issued updated guidance which highlighted \nthe steps federal agencies must take to review data quality of\n\nRecovery Act recipient reports during the continuous review period. The guidance specified that federal agencies \nmust, at a minimum, conduct a final review of the data upon the close of the continuous corrections period. In \naddition, now the Recovery Board reflects corrected data on Recovery.gov approximately every 2 weeks, allowing \nfederal agencies time to review and provide feedback in the interim period\n\nImplemented Recommendation States have been concerned about the burden imposed by new requirements, \nincreased accounting and management workloads, and strains on information systems and staff capacity at a time \nwhen they are under severe budgetary stress. We recommended in April 2009 that the Director of OMB clarify what \nRecovery Act funds can be used to support state efforts to ensure accountability and oversight, especially in light of \nenhanced oversight and coordination requirements\n\nAgency Actions On May 11, 2009, OMB released M-09-18, Payments to State Grantees for Administrative Costs of \nRecovery Act Activities, clarifying how state grantees could recover administrative costs of Recovery Act activities\n\nImplemented Recommendation States and localities are expected to report quarterly on a number of measures, \nincluding the use of funds and an estimate of the number of jobs created and the number of jobs retained as \nrequired by Section 1512 of the Recovery Act. We recommended in our July 2009 report that to increase \nconsistency in recipient reporting of jobs created and retained, the Director of OMB should work with federal \nagencies to have them provide program- specific examples of the application of OMB's guidance on recipient \nreporting of jobs created and retained Agency Actions OMB has issued clarifications and frequently asked \nquestions (FAQ) on Recovery Act reporting requirements. During the first reporting period, OMB also deployed \nregional federal employees to serve as liaisons to state and local recipients in large population centers and \nestablished a call center for entities that did not have an on-site federal liaison. In addition, federal agencies issued \nadditional guidance that builds on the OMB June 22 recipient reporting guidance for their specific programs. This \nguidance is in the form of FAQs, tip sheets, and more traditional guidance that builds on what was provided on June \n22, 2009. Federal agencies have also taken steps to provide additional education and training opportunities for\n\nRecovery Act state and local program officials on recipient reporting, including Web- based seminars\n\nImplemented Recommendation To foster timely and efficient communications, we recommended in April 2009 that \nthe Director of OMB should continue to develop and implement an approach that provides easily accessible, real-\n\n\n\ntime notification to (1) prime recipients in states and localities when funds are made available for their use and (2) \nstates-where the state is not the primary recipient of funds but has a statewide interest in this information\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, OMB has made important progress in notifying recipients \nwhen Recovery Act funds are available, communicating the status of these funds at the federal level through \nagency Weekly Financial Activity reports, and disseminating Recovery Act guidance broadly while actively seeking \npublic and stakeholder input\n\nOMB has taken the additional step of requiring federal agencies to notify Recovery Act coordinators in states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, commonwealths, and territories within 48 hours of an award to a grantee or contractor in their \njurisdiction\n\nImplemented Recommendation Responsibility for reporting on jobs created and retained falls to nonfederal \nrecipients of Recovery Act funds. As such, states and localities have a critical role in determining the degree to \nwhich Recovery Act goals are achieved. Given questions raised by many state and local officials about how best to \ndetermine both direct and indirect jobs created and retained under the Recovery Act, we recommended in April \n2009 that the Director of OMB continue OMB's efforts to identify appropriate methodologies that can be used to (1) \nassess jobs created and retained from projects funded by the Recovery Act; (2) determine the impact of Recovery \nAct spending when job creation is indirect; and (3) identify those types of programs, projects, or activities that in the \npast have demonstrated substantial job creation or are considered likely to do so in the future. We also \nrecommended that the Director of OMB consider whether the approaches taken to estimate jobs created and \nretained in these cases can be replicated or adapted to other programs\n\nAgency Actions On June 22, 2009, OMB issued additional implementation guidance on recipient reporting of jobs \ncreated and retained, (OMB memoranda M-09- 21, Implementing Guidance for the Reports on Use of Funds \nPursuant to\n\nRecovery Act the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009). This guidance is responsive to much of what \nwe recommended. The June 2009 guidance provided detailed instructions on how to calculate and report jobs as \nFTEs. It also describes in detail the data model and reporting system to be used for the required recipient \nreporting on jobs. It clarifies that the prime recipient and not the subrecipient is responsible for reporting \ninformation on jobs created or retained. Federal agencies have issued guidance that expanded on the OMB June \n22 governmentwide recipient reporting guidance and provided education and training opportunities for state and \nlocal program officials. Agency-specific guidance includes FAQs and tip sheets. Additionally, agencies are expected \nto provide examples of recipient reports for their programs, which is also consistent with what we recommended. In \naddition to the federal agency efforts, OMB has issued FAQs on Recovery Act reporting requirements. The June \n22 guidance and subsequent actions by OMB are responsive to much of what we said in our recommendation\n\nImplemented Recommendation We have noted in prior reports that in order to achieve the delicate balance \nbetween robust oversight and the smooth flow of funds to Recovery Act programs, states may need timely \nreimbursement for these activities. We recommended in September 2009 that to the extent that the Director of OMB \nhas the authority to consider mechanisms to provide additional flexibilities to support state and local officials \ncharged with carrying out Recovery Act responsibilities, it is important to expedite consideration of alternative \nadministrative cost reimbursement proposals\n\nAgency Actions In response to this recommendation, OMB issued a memorandum on October 13, 2009, to provide \nguidance to address states' questions regarding specific exceptions to OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for \nState, Local and Indian Tribal Governments. In the memorandum, OMB provided clarifications for states regarding \nspecific exceptions to OMB Circular A-87 that are necessary in order for the states to perform timely and adequate \nRecovery Act oversight, reporting, and auditing. We believe the October 2009 OMB guidance provides the \nadditional clarification needed for states and localities to proceed with their plans to recoup administrative costs\n\n\n\nImplemented Recommendation To improve the consistency of FTE data collected and reported, we recommended \nin November 2009 that OMB clarify the definition and standardize the period of measurement for the FTE data \nelement in the recipient reports\n\nRecovery Act 5GAO-10-223\n\nAgency Actions After the first round of reporting by states on their use of Recovery Act funds in October 2009, \nOMB updated the recipient reporting guidance on December 18, 2009. According to the agency, this guidance \naligns with GAO's recommendation by requiring recipients to report job estimates on a quarterly rather than a \ncumulative basis. As a result, recipients will no longer be required to sum various data on hours worked across \nmultiple quarters of data when calculating job estimates. The December guidance incorporated lessons learned \nfrom the first round of recipient reporting and also addressed recommendations we made in our November 2009 \nreport on recipient reporting.5 According to OMB, the December guidance is intended to help federal agencies \nimprove the quality of data reported under Section 1512 and simplifies compliance by revising the definitions and \ncalculations needed to define and estimate the number of jobs saved\n\nImplemented Recommendation To improve the consistency of FTE data collected and reported, we also \nrecommended in November 2009 that OMB consider being more explicit that \"jobs created or retained\" are to be \nreported as hours worked and paid for with Recovery Act funds\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, OMB issued guidance on December 18, 2009, that no longer \nrequires recipients make a subjective judgment of whether jobs were created or retained as a result of the Recovery \nAct\n\nInstead, recipients will more easily and objectively report on jobs funded with Recovery Act dollars\n\nImplemented Recommendation To improve the consistency of FTE data collected and reported, we also \nrecommended in our November 2009 report that OMB continue working with federal agencies to provide or \nimprove program-specific guidance to assist recipients, especially as it applies to the full-time equivalent calculation \nfor individual programs\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, OMB issued guidance on December 18, 2009, that required \nfederal agencies to submit their guidance\n\nRecovery Act documents to OMB for review and clearance to ensure consistency between federal agency guidance \nand the guidance released by OMB\n\nImplemented Recommendation To improve the consistency of FTE data collected and reported, we recommended \nin November 2009 that OMB work with the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and federal agencies \nto re- examine review and quality assurance processes, procedures, and requirements in light of experiences and \nidentified issues with the initial round of recipient reporting and consider whether additional modifications need to \nbe made and if additional guidance is warranted\n\nAgency Actions In response to our recommendation, on December 18, 2009, OMB issued updated guidance on \ndata quality, nonreporting recipients, and reporting of job estimates. The agency stated that the updated guidance \nincorporates lessons learned from the first reporting period and further addresses GAO's recommendations. The \nguidance also provides federal agencies with a standard methodology for effectively implementing reviews of the \nquality of data submitted by recipients\n\nImplemented Recommendation In our July 2009 report we recommended that to strengthen the effort to track the \nuse of funds, the Director of OMB should (1) clarify what constitutes appropriate quality control and reconciliation by \nprime recipients, especially for subrecipient data, and (2) specify who should best provide formal certification and \napproval of the data reported\n\n\n\nAgency Actions Although OMB clarified that the prime recipient is responsible for FederalReporting.gov data in its \nJune 22 guidance, no statement of assurance or certification will be required of prime recipients on the quality of \nsubrecipient data. Moreover, federal agencies are expected to perform data quality checks, but they are not \nrequired to certify or approve data for publication. We continue to believe that there needs to be clearer \naccountability for the data submitted and during the subsequent federal review process. OMB agreed with the \nrecommendation in concept but questioned the cost/benefit of data certification given the tight reporting time \nframes for recipients and federal agency reviewers. OMB staff stated that grant recipients are already expected to \ncomply with data requirements appropriate to the terms and conditions of a grant\n\nFurthermore, OMB will be monitoring the results of the quarterly recipient reports for data quality issues and would \nwant to determine whether these\n\nRecovery Act issues are persistent problems before concluding that certification is needed\n\nThrough issuance of additional guidance and clarification we are now satisfied OMB has implemented this \nrecommendation\n\nImplemented Recommendation In consultation with the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and \nstates, the Director of OMB should evaluate current information and data collection requirements to determine \nwhether sufficient, reliable, and timely information is being collected before adding further data collection \nrequirements. As part of this evaluation, OMB should consider the cost and burden of additional reporting on \nstates and localities against expected benefits\n\nAgency Actions OMB has taken steps to ensure data quality through issuance of additional guidance. OMB has \nalso worked with the states to minimize to the extent possible the new reporting burdens under the Recovery Act\n\nClosed Recommendation We recommended in our April report the addition of a master schedule for anticipated, \nnew, or revised federal Recovery Act program guidance and a more structured, centralized approach to making this \ninformation available, such as what is provided at Recovery.gov on recipient reporting\n\nAgency Actions This recommendation is closed because it is no longer applicable\n\nClosed Recommendation In addition to providing additional types of program-specific examples of guidance, the \nDirector of OMB should work with federal agencies to use other channels to educate state and local program \nofficials on reporting requirements, such as Web- or telephone-based information sessions or other forums\n\nAgency Actions In addition to the federal agency efforts, OMB has issued FAQs on Recovery Act reporting \nrequirements. The June 22 guidance and subsequent actions by OMB are responsive to much of what we said in \nour April 2009 report. OMB deployed regional federal employees to serve as liaisons to state and local recipients in \nlarge population centers. The objective was to provide on-site assistance and, as necessary, direct\n\nRecovery Act questions to appropriate federal officials in Washington, D.C. OMB established a call center for \nentities that do not have an on-site federal liaison. These actions by OMB, together with an overall increase in state \nand local program officials' knowledge of reporting requirements, have made this recommendation inapplicable\n\nRecovery Act Appendix III Prog Appendix III Program Descriptions Airport Improvement Program Within the \nDepartment of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program provides formula \nand discretionary grants for the planning and development of public-use airports. The Recovery Act provides $1.1 \nbillion for discretionary Grant-in- Aid for Airports under this program with priority given to projects that can be \ncompleted within 2 years. The Recovery Act requires that the funds must supplement, not supplant, planned \nexpenditures from airport- generated revenues or from other state and local sources for airport development \nactivities\n\nAssistance to Rural Law Enforcement to Combat Crime and Drugs Program The Recovery Act Assistance to Rural \nLaw Enforcement to Combat Crime and Drugs Program is administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), \n\n\n\na component of the Office of Justice Programs, Department of Justice. The purpose of this program is to help rural \nstates and rural areas prevent and combat crime, especially drug- related crime, and provides for national support \nefforts, including training and technical assistance programs strategically targeted to address rural needs. The \nRecovery Act provides $125 million for this program, and BJA has made 212 awards\n\nBrownfields Program The Recovery Act provides $100 million to the Brownfields Program, administered by the \nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response within the Environmental Protection Agency, for cleanup, \nrevitalization, and sustainable reuse of contaminated properties. The funds will be awarded to eligible entities \nthrough job training, assessment, revolving loan fund, and cleanup grants\n\nBroadband Technology Opportunities Program The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), funded \nby the Recovery Act and administered by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration provides grants to increase broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas \nof the country. BTOP grants fund projects for new or improved internet facilities in schools, libraries, hospitals, and \npublic safety facilities, projects to establish or upgrade public computer facilities that provide broadband access to \nthe general public or vulnerable populations, and projects that increase broadband internet usage among \npopulations where broadband technology has been underutilized. Projects may include training and outreach \nactivities that will increase broadband activities in people's everyday lives\n\nRecovery Act Build America Bonds Build America Bonds (BAB) administered by the Internal Revenue Service \nwithin the Department of the Treasury are taxable government bonds created by the Recovery Act that can be \nissued with federal subsidies for a portion of the borrowing costs delivered either through nonrefundable tax credits \nprovided to holders of the bonds (tax credit BAB) or as refundable tax credits paid to state and local governmental \nissuers of the bonds (direct payment BAB). Direct payment BABs are a new type of bond that provide state and \nlocal government issuers with a direct subsidy payment equal to 35 percent of the bond interest they pay. Tax credit \nBABs provide investors with a nonrefundable tax credit of 35 percent of the net bond interest payments (excluding \nthe credit), which represents a federal subsidy to the state or local governmental issuer equal to approximately 25 \npercent of the total return to the investor. State and local governments may issue an unlimited number of BABs \nthrough December 31, 2010, and all BAB proceeds must be used for capital expenditures\n\nCapital Improvement Program The Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services \nAdministration has allocated $862.5 million in Recovery Act funds for Capital Improvement Program grants to health \ncenters to support the construction, repair, and renovation of more than 1,500 health center sites nationwide, \nincluding purchasing health information technology and expanding the use of electronic health records\n\nChild Care and Development Block Grants Administered by the Administration for Children and Families within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Child Care and Development Block Grants, one of the funding streams \ncomprising the Child Care and Development Fund, are provided to states, according to a formula, to assist low- \nincome families in obtaining child care, so that parents can work or participate in education or training activities. The \nRecovery Act provides $1.9 billion in supplemental funding for these grants\n\nClean Cities Program The Department of Energy's Clean Cities program, administered by the Office of Energy \nEfficiency and Renewable Energy, is a government- industry partnership that works to reduce America's petroleum \nconsumption in the transportation sector. The Department of Energy is providing nearly $300 million in Recovery \nAct funds for projects under the Clean Cities program, which provide a range of energy-efficient and advanced \nvehicle technologies, such as hybrids, electric vehicles, plug-in electric hybrids, hydraulic hybrids, and compressed \nnatural gas vehicles, helping reduce petroleum consumption across the United States. The\n\nRecovery Act 1EPA allocated Recovery Act Clean Water SRF capitalization grants to states based on a statutory \nformula. The agency allocated Recovery Act Drinking Water SRF capitalization grants to states based on the 2003 \nDrinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey. EPA allocates Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF funds to the \nDistrict of Columbia and U.S\n\nterritories as direct grants for the same purposes\n\n\n\nprogram also supports refueling infrastructure for various alternative fuel vehicles, as well as public education and \ntraining initiatives, to further the program's goal of reducing the national demand for petroleum\n\nClean and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds The Recovery Act appropriated $4 billion for the Clean Water \nState Revolving Fund (SRF) programs and $2 billion for the Drinking Water SRF programs. These amounts are a \nsignificant increase compared to federal funds awarded as annual appropriations to the SRF programs in recent \nyears. From fiscal years 2000 through 2009, annual appropriations averaged about $1.1 billion for the Clean Water \nSRF program and about $833 million for the Drinking Water SRF program. The Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) distributed the Recovery Act funds to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to make loans \nand grants to subrecipients-local governments and other entities awarded Recovery Act funds-for eligible \nwastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects and \"nonpoint source\" pollution projects intended to protect or \nimprove water quality by, for example, controlling runoff from city streets and agricultural areas.1 The Clean Water \nand Drinking Water SRF programs, established in 1987 and 1996 respectively, provide states and local \ncommunities independent and permanent sources of subsidized financial assistance, such as low or no-interest \nloans, for projects that protect or improve water quality and that are needed to comply with federal drinking water \nregulations and protect public health\n\nIn addition to providing increased funds, the Recovery Act included specific requirements for states beyond those \nthat are part of base Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF programs. For example, states were required to have all \nRecovery Act funds awarded to projects under\n\nRecovery Act 2In this report we use the word \"project\" to mean an assistance agreement, i.e. a loan or grant \nagreement made by the state SRF program to a subrecipient for the purpose of a Recovery Act project\n\n3The Recovery Act requires states to have all funds awarded to projects \"under contract or construction\" by the 1-\nyear deadline. EPA interprets this as requiring states to have all projects under contract in an amount equal to the \nfull value of the Recovery Act assistance agreement by the deadline, regardless of whether construction has begun, \naccording to a September 2009 memorandum. Thus, in this report, we use \"under contract\" when referring to this \nrequirement. Further, according to EPA's March 2, 2009, memorandum, the agency will deobligate any Recovery \nAct SRF funds that a state does not have awarded to projects under contract by the 1-year deadline and reallocate \nthem to other states 4Under the base Drinking Water SRF, Congress has authorized states to use an amount equal \nto up to 30 percent of their capitalization grant to provide additional subsidies to communities that meet state-\ndefined criteria for being \"disadvantaged.\" There is no such statutory authorization for the Clean Water SRF \nprogram\n\ncontract within 1-year of enactment-which was February 17, 20102- and EPA was directed to reallocate any funds \nnot under contract by that date.3 Further, states were required to use at least 50 percent of Recovery Act funds to \nprovide assistance in the form of principal forgiveness, negative interest loans, or grants.4 States were also \nrequired to use at least 20 percent of funds as a \"green reserve\" to provide assistance for green infrastructure \nprojects, water or energy efficiency improvements, or other environmentally innovative activities\n\nCommunities Putting Prevention to Work The Recovery Act provides $650 million to carry out evidence-based \nclinical and community-based prevention and wellness strategies authorized by the Public Health Service Act that \ndeliver specific, measurable health outcomes that address chronic disease rates. In response to the act, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services launched the Communities Putting Prevention to work initiative on \nSeptember 17, 2009. The goals of the initiative, which is to be administered by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, are to increase levels of physical activity, improve nutrition, decrease obesity rates, and decrease \nsmoking prevalence, teen smoking initiation, and exposure to second-hand smoke through an emphasis on policy \nand environmental change at both the state and local levels. Of the $650 million appropriated for this initiative, \napproximately $450 million will support community approaches to chronic disease prevention and control; $120 \nmillion will support the efforts of states and territories to promote wellness, prevent chronic disease, and increase \ntobacco cessation; $32.5 million is allocated\n\n\n\nRecovery Act for state chronic disease self-management programs; and $40 million is allocated to establish a \nNational Prevention Media Initiative and a National Organizations Initiative to encourage the development of \nprevention and wellness messages and advertisements\n\nCommunity Development Block Grants The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, administered \nby the Office of Community Planning and Development within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nenables state and local governments to undertake a wide range of activities intended to create suitable living \nenvironments, provide affordable housing, and create economic opportunities, primarily for persons of low and \nmoderate income. Most local governments use this investment to rehabilitate affordable housing and improve key \npublic facilities. The Recovery Act includes $1 billion for the CDBG\n\nCommunity Services Block Grants Community Services Block Grants (CSBG), administered by the Administration \nfor Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services, provide federal funds to states, \nterritories, and tribes for distribution to local agencies to support a wide range of community- based activities to \nreduce poverty. The Recovery Act appropriated $1 billion for CSBG\n\nCommunity Oriented Policing Services Hiring Recovery Program The Recovery Act provided $1 billion through the \nDepartment of Justice's (DOJ) Community Oriented Policing Service's (COPS) Hiring Recovery Program (CHRP) \nfor competitive grant funding to law enforcement agencies to create and preserve jobs and to increase community \npolicing capacity and crime-prevention efforts. CHRP grants provide 100 percent funding for 3 years to cover \napproved entry-level salaries and benefits for newly-hired, full-time sworn officers, including those who were hired \nto fill positions previously unfunded, as well as rehired officers who had been laid off. CHRP funds can also be used \nin the same manner to retain officers who were scheduled to be laid off as a result of local budget cuts\n\nThere is no local funding match requirement for CHRP. When the grant term expires after 3 years, grantees must \nretain all sworn officer positions awarded under the CHRP grant for at least 1 additional year\n\nThe DOJ COPS office selected local law enforcement agencies to receive funding based on fiscal health factors-\nsuch as changes in budgets for law enforcement, poverty, unemployment, and foreclosure rates-and reported \ncrime and planned community policing activities. DOJ awards 50\n\nRecovery Act 5For the purposes of this report, \"Title I\" refers to Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended\n\n6LEAs must obligate at least 85 percent of their Recovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A funds by September 30, 2010, \nunless granted a waiver, and must obligate all of their funds by September 30, 2011. This will be referred to as a \ncarryover limitation\n\npercent of CHRP funds to local law enforcement agencies with populations greater than 150,000 and awards the \nremaining 50 percent to local law enforcement agencies with populations of less than 150,000\n\nAwards were capped at no more than 5 percent of the applicant agency's actual sworn force strength (up to a \nmaximum of 50 officers) and a minimum of $5 million was allocated to each state or eligible territory\n\nDiesel Emission Reduction Act Grants The program objective of the Diesel Emission Reduction Act Grants, \nadministered by the Office of Air and Radiation in conjunction with the Office of Grants and Debarment, within the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is to reduce diesel emissions. EPA will award grants to address the \nemissions of in-use diesel engines by promoting a variety of cost- effective emission reduction strategies, including \nswitching to cleaner fuels, retrofitting, repowering or replacing eligible vehicles and equipment, and idle reduction \nstrategies. The Recovery Act appropriated $300 million for the Diesel Emission Reduction Act Grants. In addition, \nthe funds appropriated through the Recovery Act for the program are not subject to the State Grant and Loan \nProgram Matching Incentive provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005\n\n\n\nEducation Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Title I, Part A The Recovery Act provides $10 billion \nto help local educational agencies (LEA) educate disadvantaged youth by making additional funds available beyond \nthose regularly allocated through Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as \namended.5 These additional funds are distributed through states to LEAs using existing federal funding formulas, \nwhich target funds based on such factors as high concentrations of students from families living in poverty. In using \nthe funds, LEAs are required to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and must obligate 85 \npercent of the funds by September 30, 2010.6 The Department of Education is advising LEAs to use the funds in \nways that will build the agencies' long-term capacity to serve\n\nRecovery Act 7Under ESEA, schools in improvement have failed to meet adequate yearly progress for at least 2 \nconsecutive years\n\n8School Improvement Grants are authorized under Section 1003(g) of ESEA\n\n9Final requirements for SIG were published in Dec. 2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 65618 (Dec. 10, 2009)), and were \namended by interim final requirements published in Jan. 2010 (75 Fed\n\nReg. 3375 (Jan. 21, 2010))\n\n10To identify the persistently lowest-achieving schools in the state, a state educational agency must take into \naccount both the performance of all students in a school on the state's assessments in reading/language arts and \nmathematics combined and the lack of progress by all students on those assessments over a number of years\n\ndisadvantaged youth, such as through providing professional development to teachers. The Recovery Act also \nappropriated $3 billion for ESEA Title I School Improvement Grants (SIG), which provides funds to states for use in \nESEA Title I schools identified for improvement7 in order to substantially raise the achievement of their students.8 \nThese funds are awarded by formula to states, which will then make competitive grants to LEAs. State applications \nfor the $3 billion in Recovery Act SIG funding, as well as an additional $546 million in regular fiscal year 2009 SIG \nfunding, were due to the Department of Education on February 28, 2010. SIG regulatory requirements effective in \nFebruary 2010,9 prioritize the use of SIG funds in each state's persistently lowest-achieving Title I schools.10 To \nreceive funds, states must identify their persistently lowest-achieving schools, and an LEA that wishes to receive \nSIG funds must submit an application to its state educational agency (SEA) identifying which schools it commits to \nserve and how it will use school improvement funds to implement one of four school intervention models (1) \nturnaround model, which includes replacing the principal and rehiring no more than 50 percent of the school's staff; \n(2) restart model, in which an LEA converts the school or closes and reopens it as a charter school or under an \neducation management organization; (3) school closure, in which an LEA closes the school and enrolls the students \nwho attended the school in other, higher-achieving schools in the LEA; or (4) the transformation model, which \naddresses four specific areas intended to improve schools\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, Parts B and C The Recovery Act provided supplemental funding for \nprograms authorized by Part B and C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) as amended, the \nmajor federal statute that supports early intervention and special education and related services for children and \nyouth with disabilities. Part B funds programs that ensure preschool and school- age\n\nRecovery Act 11The four core areas of education reform, as described by Education, are (1) increase teacher \neffectiveness and address inequities in the distribution of highly qualified teachers; (2) establish a pre-K- through-\ncollege data system to track student progress and foster improvement; (3) make progress toward rigorous college- \nand career- ready standards and high-quality assessments that are valid and reliable for all students, including \nstudents with limited English proficiency and students with disabilities; and (4) provide targeted, intensive support \nand effective interventions to turn around schools identified for corrective action or restructuring\n\nchildren with disabilities access to a free and appropriate public education and is divided into two separate grants-\nPart B grants to states (for school-age children) and Part B preschool grants. Part C funds programs that provide \n\n\n\nearly intervention and related services for infants and toddlers with disabilities-or at risk of developing a disability-\nand their families\n\nState Fiscal Stabilization Fund The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) included approximately $48.6 billion to \naward to states by formula and up to $5 billion to award to states as competitive grants. The Recovery Act created \nthe SFSF in part to help state and local governments stabilize their budgets by minimizing budgetary cuts in \neducation and other essential government services, such as public safety. Stabilization funds for education \ndistributed under the Recovery Act must first be used to alleviate shortfalls in state support for education to LEAs \nand public institutions of higher education (IHE)\n\nStates must use 81.8 percent of their SFSF formula grant funds to support education (these funds are referred to as \neducation stabilization funds) and must use the remaining 18.2 percent for public safety and other government \nservices, which may include education (these funds are referred to as government services funds). The SFSF funds \nare being provided to states in two phases. Phase 1 funds-at least 67 percent of education stabilization funds and \nall government services funds-were provided to each state after the Department of Education (Education) approved \nthe state's Phase 1 application for funds. Phase 2 funds are being awarded to states as Education approves each \nstate's Phase 2 application The Phase 1 application required each state to provide several assurances, including \nthat the state will meet maintenance-of-effort requirements (or will be able to comply with the relevant waiver \nprovisions); will meet requirements for accountability, transparency, reporting, and compliance with certain federal \nlaws and regulations; and that it will implement strategies to advance four core areas of education reform.11 The \nPhase 2 application requires each state to explain the information the state makes available to the public related to \nthe four core areas of education reform or provide plans for making information related to the education reforms\n\nRecovery Act publicly available no later than September 30, 2011. States must use education stabilization funds to \nrestore state funding to the greater of fiscal year 2008 or 2009 levels for state support to LEAs and public IHEs\n\nWhen distributing these funds to LEAs, states must use their primary education funding formula, but they can \ndetermine how to allocate funds to public IHEs. In general, LEAs maintain broad discretion in how they can use \neducation stabilization funds, but states have some ability to direct IHEs in how to use these funds\n\nEdward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program The Recovery Act provided $2 billion through the \nDepartment of Justice's (DOJ) Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program for grants to state \nand local governments for law enforcement and criminal justice activities. JAG funds can be used to support a \nrange of activities in seven broad program areas (1) law enforcement; (2) prosecution and courts; (3) crime \nprevention and education; (4) corrections; (5) drug treatment and enforcement; (6) program planning, evaluation, \nand technology improvement; and (7) crime victim and witness programs. Within these areas, JAG funds can be \nused for state and local initiatives, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, research, and \ninformation systems for criminal justice\n\nAlthough each state is guaranteed a minimum allocation of JAG funding, states and localities therein must apply to \nDOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to receive their grant awards. BJA applies a statutory formula based on \npopulation and violent crime statistics to determine annual funding levels. After applying the formula, BJA \ndistributes each state's allocation in two ways - BJA awards 60 percent directly to the state, and the state must in \nturn allocate a formula-based share of these funds-considered a \"variable pass- through,\" to its local governments; \nand - BJA awards the remaining 40 percent directly to eligible units of local government within the state\n\nElectronic Baggage Screening Program Administered by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Electronic Baggage Screening Program provides funding to strengthen \nscreening of checked baggage in airports. The Recovery Act provided approximately $1 billion to invest in the \nprocurement and installation of checked baggage explosives detection systems and checkpoint explosives \ndetection equipment. According to Recovery Act 12Pub. L. No. 100-77, 101 Stat. 482 (July 22, 1987)\n\n13Under the Act, the members of the EFSP National Board are to be the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (Chair) and six members appointed by the Director from individuals nominated by the \n\n\n\nfollowing organizations American Red Cross, Catholic Charities USA, National Council of Churches of Christ in the \nUSA, The Salvation Army, The Council of Jewish Federations, Inc. (now known as The Jewish Federations of North \nAmerica), and the United Way of America (now known as United Way Worldwide)\n\nTSA, it has allocated over $700 million to its Electronic Baggage Screening Program for purposes that include \nfacility modifications; equipment purchase and installation; and programmatic, maintenance, and technological \nsupport\n\nEmergency Food and Shelter Program The Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP), which is administered \nby the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security, was \nauthorized in July 1987 by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to provide food, shelter, and \nsupportive services to the homeless.12 The program is governed by a National Board composed of a \nrepresentative from FEMA and six statutorily designated national nonprofit organizations.13 Since its first \nappropriation in fiscal year 1983, EFSP has awarded over $3.4 billion in federal aid to more than 12,000 local \nprivate, nonprofit and government human service entities in more than 2,500 communities nationwide\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants (EECBG), \nadministered by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within the Department of Energy, provides \nfunds through competitive and formula grants to units of local and state government and Indian tribes to develop \nand implement projects to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use and fossil fuel emissions in their \ncommunities. The Recovery Act includes $3.2 billion for the EECBG. Of that total, $400 million is to be awarded on \na competitive basis to grant applicants\n\nGreen Capacity Building Grants Under the Recovery Act, the Green Capacity Building Grants program, \nadministered by the Employment and Training Administration within the Department of Labor, provides funds to \nbuild the green training capacity of current Department of Labor (Labor) grantees. Grants will help individuals in \ntargeted groups acquire the skills needed to enter and advance in green industries and occupations by building the \ncapacity of\n\nRecovery Act active Labor-funded training programs. Grantees are required to give priority to targeted groups, \nincluding workers impacted by national energy and environmental policy, individuals in need of updated training \nrelated to energy-efficiency and renewable energy industries, veterans, unemployed individuals, and individuals \nwith criminal records\n\nHealth Information Technology Extension Program The Department of Health and Human Services' Health \nInformation Technology Extension Program, administered by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health \nInformation Technology, allocated $643 million to establish 60 Health Information Technology Regional Extension \nCenters (REC) and $50 million to establish a national Health Information Technology Research Center (HITRC). \nThe first cycle of awards, announced February 12, 2010, provided $375 million to create 32 RECs, while the second \ncycle of awards, announced April 6, 2010, provided $267 million to establish 28 RECs. RECs offer technical \nassistance, guidance, and information on best practices for the use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to health \ncare providers. The HITRC supports RECs' efforts by collecting information on best practices from a wide variety of \nsources across the country and by acting as a virtual community for RECs to collaborate with one another and with \nrelevant stakeholders to identify and share best practices for the use of EHRs. The goal of the RECs and HITRC is \nto enable nationwide health information exchange through the adoption and meaningful use of secure EHRs\n\nHead Start/Early Head Start The Head Start program, administered by the Office of Head Start of the \nAdministration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services, provides \ncomprehensive early childhood development services to low-income children, including educational, health, \nnutritional, social, and other services, intended to promote the school readiness of low-income children. Federal \nHead Start funds are provided directly to local grantees, rather than through states. The Recovery Act provided an \nadditional $2.1 billion in funding for Head Start and Early Head Start programs. The Early Head Start program \nprovides family-centered services to low-income families with very young children designed to promote the \n\n\n\ndevelopment of the children, and to enable their parents to fulfill their roles as parents and to move toward self-\nsufficiency\n\nHigh-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program The High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program (HSIPR) is \nadministered by the Federal Railroad Administration, within the Department of Transportation (DOT). The purpose \nof the HSIPR Program is to build an\n\nRecovery Act efficient, high-speed passenger rail network connecting major population centers 100 to 600 miles \napart. In the near-term, the program will aid in economic recovery efforts and lay the foundation for this high-speed \npassenger rail network through targeted investments in existing intercity passenger rail infrastructure, equipment, \nand intermodal connections. In addition to the $8 billion provided in the Recovery Act, the HSIPR Program also \nincluded approximately $92 million in fiscal year 2009 and remaining fiscal year 2008 funds appropriated under the \nexisting State Grant Program (formally titled, Capital Assistance to States-Intercity Passenger Rail Service). The \nfiscal year 2010 DOT appropriation included $2.5 billion for high speed rail and intercity passenger rail projects\n\nHomelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program The Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing \nProgram, administered by the Office of Community Planning and Development within the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, awards formula grants to states and localities to prevent homelessness and procure \nshelter for those who have become homeless. Funding for this program is being distributed based on the formula \nused for the Emergency Shelter Grants program. According to the Recovery Act, program funds should be used for \nshort- term or medium-term rental assistance; housing relocation and stabilization services, including housing \nsearch, mediation or outreach to property owners, credit repair, security or utility deposits, utility payments, and \nrental assistance for management; or appropriate activities for homeless prevention and rapid re-housing of \npersons who have become homeless. The Recovery Act includes $1.5 billion for this program\n\nHighway Infrastructure Investment Program The Recovery Act provides funding to states for restoration, repair, and \nconstruction of highways and other activities allowed under the Federal Highway Administration's Federal-Aid \nHighway Surface Transportation Program and for other eligible surface transportation projects. The Recovery Act \nrequires that 30 percent of these funds be suballocated, primarily based on population, for metropolitan, regional, \nand local use\n\nHighway funds are apportioned to states through federal-aid highway program mechanisms, and states must follow \nexisting program requirements. While the maximum federal fund share of highway infrastructure investment \nprojects under the existing federal-aid highway program is generally 80 percent, under the Recovery Act, it is 100 \npercent\n\nFunds appropriated for highway infrastructure spending must be used in accordance with Recovery Act \nrequirements. States were given a 1-year\n\nRecovery Act 14For the Highway Infrastructure Investment program, DOT has interpreted the term \"obligation of \nfunds\" to mean the federal government's commitment to pay for the federal share of the project. This commitment \noccurs at the time the federal government signs a project agreement\n\n15Recovery Act, div. A, title XII, 123 Stat. 206\n\n16Recovery Act, div. A, title XII, 1201(a)\n\n17The full list of qualifying Transportation Enhancement activities is defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(35)\n\ndeadline (March 2, 2010) to ensure that all apportioned Recovery Act funds-including suballocated funds-were \nobligated.14 The Secretary of Transportation was to withdraw and redistribute to eligible states any amount that \nwas not obligated by that time.15 Additionally, the governor of each state was required to certify that the state would \nmaintain its level of spending for the types of transportation projects funded by the Recovery Act it planned to spend \nthe day the Recovery Act was enacted. As part of this certification, the governor of each state was required to \n\n\n\nidentify the amount of funds the state planned to expend from state sources from February 17, 2009, through \nSeptember 30, 2010.16 On March 2, 2009, the Federal Highway Administration apportioned $799.8 million in \nRecovery Act funds to states for its Transportation Enhancement program. States may use program funds for \nqualifying surface transportation activities, such as constructing or rehabilitating off- road shared use paths for \nbicycles and pedestrians; conducting landscaping and other beautification projects along highways, streets, and \nwaterfronts; and rehabilitating and operating historic transportation facilities such as historic railroad depots.17 The \nRecovery Act requires that 3 percent of Highway Infrastructure Investment funds provided to states must be used \nfor Transportation Enhancement activities. Additionally, states may decide to use additional Recovery Act \nTransportation Enhancement funds, beyond the 3 percent requirement, for qualifying activities such as those \nmentioned above. States determine the share of federal funds used for qualifying Transportation Enhancement \nprojects up to 100 percent of the projects' costs\n\nIncreased Demand for Services The Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services \nAdministration (HRSA) has allocated Recovery Act funds for Increased Demand for Services (IDS) grants to health \ncenters to increase health center staffing, extend hours of operations, and expand existing\n\nRecovery Act 18The Recovery Act provided $2 billion to HRSA for grants to health centers. Of this total, $1.5 billion \nis for the construction and renovation of health centers and the acquisition of Health Information Technology \nsystems, and the remaining $500 million is for operating grants to health centers. Of the $500 million for health \ncenter operations, HRSA has allocated $157 million for New Access Point grants to support health centers' new \nservice delivery sites, and $343 million for IDS grants\n\nservices. The Recovery Act provided $500 million for health center operations. HRSA has allocated $343 million for \nIDS grants to health centers.18 Internet Crimes Against Children Initiatives Internet Crimes Against Children \nInitiatives (ICAC), administered by the Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs' Office of Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention, seeks to maintain and expand state and regional ICAC task forces to address \ntechnology- facilitated child exploitation. This program provides funding to states and localities for salaries and \nemployment costs of law enforcement officers, prosecutors, forensic analysts, and other related professionals. The \nRecovery Act appropriated $50 million for ICAC\n\nLead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grants and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Grant Program The Recovery \nAct provided approximately $78 million to the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program through the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to assist states and localities in undertaking programs to identify \nand control lead-based paint hazards in eligible privately owned housing for rental or owner-occupants. Funds will \nbe used to perform lead-based paint inspections, soil and paint-chip testing, risk assessments, and other activities \nthat are in support of lead hazard abatement work. An additional $2.6 million was provided for the Lead Hazard \nReduction Demonstration Grant Program which will assist urban areas with the greatest lead paint abatement \nneeds to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in eligible privately owned single- family housing units and \nmultifamily buildings occupied by low-income families Local Energy Assurance Planning Initiative The Recovery Act \nprovided funding to support Local Energy Assurance Planning (LEAP) Initiatives to help communities prepare for \nenergy emergencies and disruptions. The Department of Energy will award funds to cities and towns to develop or \nexpand local energy assurance plans that will improve electricity reliability and energy security in their communities. \nLEAP aims to facilitate recovery from disruptions to the\n\nRecovery Act energy supply and enhance reliability and quicker repairs following energy supply disruptions\n\nMedicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care \nfor certain categories of low-income individuals, including children, families, persons with disabilities, and persons \nwho are elderly. The federal government matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a formula \nbased on each state's per capita income in relation to the national average per capita income. The Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, within the Department of Health and Human Services, approves state Medicaid \nplans, and the amount of federal assistance states receive for Medicaid service expenditures is determined by the \nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The Recovery Act's temporary increase in FMAP funding will \n\n\n\nprovide all 50 states and the District with approximately $87 billion in assistance. Federal legislation was recently \nenacted amending the Recovery Act to provide for an extension of increased FMAP funding through June 30, 2011, \nbut at a lower level\n\nNational Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Projects The Recovery Act provided $156 million in new funding to the \nNational Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program to support the implementation of verified and certified diesel \nemission reduction technologies. The competitive grant program funded projects that would achieve significant \nreductions in diesel emissions, especially from fleets operating in areas designated as having poor air quality. This \nis one of the Recovery Act- funded National Clean Diesel Campaign programs which have the goal to accelerate \nemission reductions from older diesel engines to provide air quality benefits and improve public health\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts Recovery Act Grants The Recovery Act provides $50 million to be distributed in \ndirect grants by the National Endowment for the Arts to fund arts projects and activities that preserve jobs in the \nnonprofit arts sector threatened by declines in philanthropic and other support during the current economic \ndownturn\n\nNeighborhood Stabilization Program 2 The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), administered by the Office \nof Community Planning and Development within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, provides \nassistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes and residential properties in order that such \nproperties may be returned to productive use or made available for redevelopment purposes. The $2 billion in \nNSP2\n\nRecovery Act 19NSP, a term that references the NSP funds authorized under Division B, Title III of the Housing and \nEconomic Recovery Act of 2008, provides grants to all states and selected local governments on a formula basis. \nUnder NSP, the Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated $3.92 billion on a formula basis to \nstates, territories, and selected local governments. The term \"NSP2\" references the NSP funds authorized under \nthe Recovery Act on a competitive basis\n\nfunds appropriated in the Recovery Act are competitively awarded to states, local governments, and nonprofit \norganizations.19 NSP is considered to be a component of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) \nprogram and basic CDBG requirement Port Security Grant Program The Port Security Grant Program (PSGP) \nprovides grant funding to port areas for the protection of critical port infrastructure from terrorism. The Recovery Act \nprovides $150 million in stimulus funding for the PSGP administered by the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency (FEMA), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security. PSGP funds are primarily intended to assist \nports in enhancing maritime domain awareness, enhancing risk management capabilities to prevent, detect, \nrespond to, and recover from attacks involving improvised explosive devices, weapons of mass destruction and \nother nonconventional weapons, as well as training and exercises and Transportation Worker Identification \nCredential implementation. Ports compete for funds and priority is given to cost-effective projects that can be \nexecuted expeditiously and have a significant and near-term impact on risk mitigation\n\nPublic Housing Capital Fund The Public Housing Capital Fund provides formula-based grant funds directly to public \nhousing agencies to improve the physical condition of their properties; to develop, finance, and modernize public \nhousing developments; and to improve management. Under the Recovery Act, the Office of Public and Indian \nHousing within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocated nearly $3 billion through the \nPublic Housing Capital Fund to public housing agencies using the same formula for amounts made available in \nfiscal year 2008 and obligated these funds to housing agencies in March 2009\n\nHUD was also required to award nearly $1 billion to public housing agencies based on competition for priority \ninvestments, including investments that leverage private sector funding or financing for renovations and energy \nconservation retrofitting. In September 2009, HUD\n\n20Fixed guideway systems use and occupy a separate right-of-way for the exclusive use of public transportation \nservices. They include fixed rail, exclusive lanes for buses and other high-occupancy vehicles, and other systems\n\n\n\n21Generally, to qualify for funding under the applicable formula grant program, an urbanized area must have a fixed \nguideway system that has been in operation for at least 7 years and is more than 1 mile in length\n\n22Metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) are federally mandated regional organizations, representing local \ngovernments and working in coordination with state departments of transportation, that are responsible for \ncomprehensive transportation planning and programming in urbanized areas. MPOs facilitate decision making on \nregional transportation issues, including major capital investment projects and priorities. To be eligible for Recovery \nAct funding, projects must be included in the region's Transportation Improvement and State Transportation \nImprovement Programs\n\nawarded competitive grants for the creation of energy-efficient communities, gap financing for projects stalled due \nto financing issues, public housing transformation, and improvements addressing the needs of the elderly or \npersons with disabilities\n\nPublic Transportation Program The Recovery Act appropriated $8.4 billion to fund public transit throughout the \ncountry through existing Federal Transit Administration (FTA) grant programs, including the Transit Capital \nAssistance Program, and the Fixed Guideway Infrastructure Investment Program. Under the Transit Capital \nAssistance Program's formula grant program, Recovery Act funds were apportioned to large and medium urbanized \nareas-which in some cases include a metropolitan area that spans multiple states- throughout the country according \nto existing program formulas. Recovery Act funds were also apportioned to states for small urbanized areas and \nnonurbanized areas under the Transit Capital Assistance Program's formula grant programs using the program's \nexisting formula. Transit Capital Assistance Program funds may be used for such activities as vehicle replacements, \nfacilities renovation or construction, preventive maintenance, and paratransit services. Recovery Act funds from the \nFixed Guideway Infrastructure Investment Program20 were apportioned by formula directly to qualifying urbanized \nareas, and funds may be used for any capital projects to maintain, modernize, or improve fixed guideway \nsystems.21 As they work through the state and regional transportation planning process, designated recipients of \nthe apportioned funds- typically public transit agencies and metropolitan planning organizations-develop a list of \ntransit projects that project sponsors (typically transit agencies) submit to FTA for approval.22 Recovery Act\n\n23For the Transit Capital Assistance Program and Fixed Guideway Infrastructure Investment Program, the \nDepartment of Transportation has interpreted the term obligation of funds to mean the federal government's \ncommitment to pay for the federal share of the project. This commitment occurs at the time the federal government \nsigns a grant agreement\n\n24Recovery Act, div. A, title XII,123 Stat. 210\n\n25Recovery Act, div. A, title XII, 1201(a)\n\nRecovery Act Funds appropriated for the Transit Capital Assistance Program and the Fixed Guideway Infrastructure \nInvestment Program must be used in accordance with Recovery Act requirements. States were given a 1-year \ndeadline (March 5, 2010) to ensure that all apportioned Recovery Act funds were obligated.23 The Secretary of \nTransportation was to withdraw and redistribute to each state or urbanized area any amount that was not obligated \nwithin these time frames.24 Additionally, the governor of each state was required to certify that the state would \nmaintain its level of spending for the types of transportation projects funded by the Recovery Act it planned to spend \nthe day the Recovery Act was enacted. As part of this certification, the governor of each state was required to \nidentify the amount of funds the state planned to expend from state sources from February 17, 2009, through \nSeptember 30, 2010.25 The Transit Investments for Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reduction (TIGGER) Grant \nprogram, administered by FTA within the Department of Transportation, is a discretionary program to support transit \ncapital projects that result in greenhouse gas reductions or reduced energy use\n\nThe Recovery Act provides $100 million for the TIGGER program, and each submitted proposal must request a \nminimum of $2 million\n\n\n\nRace to the Top Fund The Recovery Act includes up to $5 billion for the Race to the Top Fund, administered by the \nOffice of Elementary and Secondary Education within the Department of Education (Education). According to \nEducation, awards in Race to the Top will go to states that are leading the way with ambitious yet achievable plans \nfor implementing coherent, compelling, and comprehensive educational reform. Through Race to the Top, \nEducation asks states to advance reforms in four specific areas adopting standards and assessments that prepare \nstudents to succeed in college and the workplace and to compete in the global economy; building data systems that \nmeasure student growth and success, and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction; \nrecruiting,\n\nRecovery Act developing, rewarding, and retaining effective teachers and principals, especially where they are \nneeded most; and turning around our lowest- achieving schools\n\nRecovery Act Assistance to Firefighters Fire Station Construction Grants The Recovery Act Assistance to \nFirefighters Fire Station Construction Grants, also known as fire grants or the FIRE Act grant program, is \nadministered by the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Assistance to \nFirefighters Program Office. The program provides federal grants directly to fire departments on a competitive basis \nto build or modify existing nonfederal fire stations in order for departments to enhance their response capability and \nprotect the communities they serve from fire and fire-related hazards. The Recovery Act includes $210 million for \nthis program and provides that no grant shall exceed $15 million\n\nRecovery Act Impact on Child Support Incentives The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Program (Title IV-D of the \nSocial Security Act) is a joint federal-state program administered by the Administration for Children and Families \n(ACF), within the Department of Health and Human Services. The program provides federal matching funds to \nstates to carry out their child support enforcement programs, which enhance the well-being of children by, among \nother things, establishing paternity, establishing child support orders, and collecting child support\n\nFurthermore, ACF makes additional incentive payments to states based in part on their child support enforcement \nprograms meeting certain performance goals. States must reinvest their incentive fund payments into the CSE \nprogram or an activity to improve the CSE program; however, incentive funds reinvested in the CSE program are \nnot eligible for federal matching funds. Funds for the federal matching payments and incentive payments are \nappropriated annually, and the Recovery Act does not appropriate funds for either of them. However, the Recovery \nAct temporarily provides for incentive payments expended by states for child support enforcement to count as state \nfunds eligible for the federal match\n\nThis change is effective October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2010\n\nRecovery Zone Bonds Recovery Zone Bonds are administered by the Internal Revenue Service within the \nDepartment of the Treasury and come in two types Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds (RZEDB) and \nRecovery Zone Facility Bonds. RZEDB are a type of direct payment Build America Bond (BAB), created under the \nRecovery Act. Direct payment BABs allow issuers the option of receiving a federal payment instead of allowing a \nfederal tax\n\nRecovery Act exemption on the interest payments. RZEDBs provide a 45 percent credit instead of a 35 percent \ncredit like other types of BABs and must meet certain requirements. RZEDBs are targeted to economically \ndistressed areas meeting certain criteria and are to be used for qualified forms of economic development. Recovery \nZone Facility Bonds are exempt facility bonds which may be used to finance certain designated recovery zone \nproperty. The Recovery Act authorized up to $10 billion for RZEDBs and up to $15 billion for Recovery Zone Facility \nBonds to be allocated to states, the District of Columbia, and territories, based to the their employment declines in \n2008\n\nRenewable and Distributed Systems Integration The Renewable and Distributed Systems Integration (RDSI) \nprogram, administered by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability within the Department of Energy \n(DOE), focuses on integrating renewable and distributed energy technologies into the electric distribution and \ntransmission system. In April 2008, DOE announced plans to invest up to $50 million over 5 years (fiscal years \n\n\n\n2008 to 2012) in nine projects aimed at demonstrating the use of RDSI technologies to reduce peak load electricity \ndemand by at least 15 percent at distribution feeders-the power lines delivering electricity to consumers. The \nprogram goal is to reduce peak load electricity demand by 20 percent at distribution feeders by 2015\n\nRetrofit Ramp-Up Program The Recovery Act's Retrofit Ramp-Up program will provide funding to projects to \"ramp-\nup\" energy efficiency building retrofits. The program will target community-scale retrofit projects that make \nsignificant, long- term impacts on energy use and can serve as national role models for energy-efficiency efforts. \nThese programs should result in retrofits that lead to significant efficiency improvements to a large number of \nbuildings in communities or neighborhoods. The retrofits must reduce the total monthly operating costs of the \nbuildings including any repayments of loans. The Retrofit Ramp-Up projects are the competitive portion of DOE's \nEnergy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program and are part of the Recovery Act investment in clean \nenergy and energy efficiency\n\nSenior Community Service Employment Program The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), \nadministered by the Employment and Training Administration within the Department of Labor, is a community \nservice and work-based training program which serves low-income persons who are 55 years or older and have \npoor employment prospects by placing them in part-time community\n\nRecovery Act service positions and by assisting them to transition to unsubsidized employment. The Recovery Act \nprovides $120 million for SCSEP\n\nSenior Nutrition Programs The Recovery Act provides $100 million to the Senior Nutrition Programs, administered \nby the Administration on Aging (AoA) within the Department of Health and Human Services. AoA distributed funds \nto 56 States and Territories and 246 tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to fund three programs at senior \ncenters and other community sites. The Recovery act awarded $65 million for congregate nutrition services \nprovided at senior centers and other community sites, $32 million for home-delivered nutrition services delivered to \nelders at home, and $3 million for Native American nutrition programs. The Congregate Nutrition Services and \nHome- delivered Nutrition Services programs specifically targets vulnerable seniors, such as low-income minorities \nand those residing in rural areas, and aims to help elderly individuals avoid hospitalization and nursing home \nplacement by maintaining their health through meals. The Nutrition Services for Native Americans provides \ncongregate and home- delivered meals and related nutrition services to American Indian, Alaskan Native, and \nNative Hawaiian elders\n\nServices*Training*Officers*Prosecutors Violence Against Women Formula Grants Program Under the \nServices*Training*Officers*Prosecutors (STOP) Violence Against Women Formula Grants Program, the Office on \nViolence Against Women within the Department of Justice, has awarded over $139 million in Recovery Act funds to \npromote a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to enhance services and advocacy to victims, improve the \ncriminal justice system's response, and promote effective law enforcement, prosecution, and judicial strategies to \naddress domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking\n\nSmart Grid Investment Grant Program Under the Recovery Act, states will receive $3.4 billion to deploy and \nintegrate advanced digital technology to modernize the electric delivery network through the Smart Grid Investment \nGrant Program, administered by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability within the Department of \nEnergy. The program funds a broad range of projects aimed at applying smart grid technologies to existing electric \nsystem equipment, consumer products and appliances, meters, electric distribution and transmission systems, and \nhomes, offices, and industrial facilities\n\n26Per FEMA's definition, a \"volunteer fire department is composed entirely of members who do not receive \ncompensation other than a length of service retirement program (LSOP) and insurance. A career department is one \nin which all members are compensated for their services. A combination department has at least one volunteer, \nwith the balance being career members, or one career member with the balance being volunteers. Also, if a \nvolunteer fire department provides stipends to their members or provides pay-on-call for their members, the \ndepartment is considered to be combination.\" 27Volunteer fire departments are eligible to apply for both Hiring and \n\n\n\nRecruitment and Retention grants. Combination fire departments are eligible to apply for both Hiring/Rehiring of \nFirefighters and Recruitment and Retention of volunteer firefighters SAFER grants. Career fire departments are only \neligible to apply for SAFER Hiring/Rehiring of firefighters grants\n\nRecovery Act Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency \nResponse (SAFER) grants program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, was created to provide funding directly to volunteer, combination, and career fire \ndepartments26 to help them increase staffing and enhance their emergency deployment capabilities. The goal of \nSAFER is to ensure departments have an adequate number of trained, frontline active firefighters capable of safely \nresponding to and protecting their communities from fire and fire-related hazards. SAFER provides 2-year grants to \nfire departments to pay the salaries of newly hired firefighters or to rehire recently laid-off firefighters\n\nFire departments using SAFER funding to hire new fire fighters commit to retaining the SAFER-funded firefighters \nfor 1 full year after the 2-year grant has been expended. The retention commitment does not extend to previously \nlaid-off firefighters who have been rehired. In addition, volunteer and combination firefighter departments are \neligible to apply for SAFER funding to pay for activities related to the recruitment and retention of volunteer \nfirefighters.27 State Broadband Data and Development Program The Recovery Act appropriated $7.2 billion to \nextend access to broadband throughout the United States. Of the $7.2 billion, $4.7 billion was appropriated to the \nDepartment of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and $2.5 billion to \nthe Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service. Of the $4.7 billion, up to $350 million was available pursuant \nto the Broadband Data Improvement Act (BDIA) for the purpose of developing and maintaining a nationwide map \nfeaturing the availability of broadband service. BDIA directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish the State \nBroadband Data and Development Grant Program and to award grants to eligible entities to develop and implement \nstatewide initiatives to identify\n\nRecovery Act and track the adoption and availability of broadband services within each state. To accomplish the \njoint purposes of the Recovery Act and BDIA, NTIA has developed the State Broadband Data and Development \nprojects that collect comprehensive and accurate state-level broadband mapping data, develop state-level \nbroadband maps, aid in the development and maintenance of a national broadband map, and fund statewide \ninitiatives directed at broadband planning State Energy Program Under the Recovery Act, states will receive $3.1 \nbillion for energy projects through the State Energy Program (SEP), administered by the Office of Energy Efficiency \nand Renewable Energy within the Department of Energy (DOE). States should prioritize the grants toward funding \nenergy- efficiency and renewable energy programs, including expanding existing energy-efficiency programs, \nrenewable energy projects, and joint activities between states. The SEP's 20 percent cost match is not required for \ngrants made with Recovery Act funds. DOE estimates that SEP funding will have an annual costs savings of $256 \nmillion\n\nState Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement Program Under the Department of Health and Human \nServices' State Health Information Exchange (HIE) Cooperative Agreement Program, $564 million has been \nallocated to support states' efforts to develop the capacity among health care providers and hospitals in their \njurisdiction to exchange health information across health care systems through the meaningful use of Electronic \nHealth Records (EHR). The meaningful use of EHRs aims to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care. In \norder to ensure secure and effective use of HIE technology within and across state borders, grant recipients are \nexpected to use their authority and resources to implement HIE privacy and security requirements, coordinate with \nMedicaid and state public health programs in using HIE technology, and enable interoperability through the creation \nof state-level directories and technical services and the removal of barriers. The state HIE program uses a \ncooperative agreement, or partnership between the grant recipient and the federal government, to administer the \nawards (when the federal government has a substantial stake in the outcomes or operation of the program). The \nstate HIE cooperative agreements are 4- year agreements and recipients will be required to match grant awards \nbeginning in the second year of the award, 2011\n\n\n\nRecovery Act Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems The Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems grant program, \nadministered by the Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences, awards competitive grants to state \neducational agencies for the design, development, and implementation of statewide longitudinal data systems\n\nThese systems are intended to enhance the ability of states to efficiently and accurately manage, analyze, and use \neducation data, including individual student records, while protecting student privacy. The first grants were awarded \nto 14 states in November 2005; 12 states and the District of Columbia were awarded grants in 2007, and 27 states \nwere awarded grants in 2009. The Recovery Act appropriated $250 million for this program\n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly the Food Stamp Program) The Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP), administered by the Food and Nutrition Service within the Department of Agriculture, \nserves more than 35 million people nationwide each month. SNAP's goal, in part, is to help raise the level of \nnutrition and alleviate the hunger of low-income households. The Recovery Act provides for a monthly increase in \nbenefits for the program's recipients. The increases in benefits under the Recovery Act are estimated to total $20 \nbillion over the next 5 years\n\nTax Credit Assistance Program (TCAP) and Section 1602 Program The Tax Credit Assistance Program \nadministered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides gap financing to be used by \nstate Housing Finance Agencies (HFA) in the form of grants or loans for capital investment in low-income housing \ntax credits (LIHTC) projects through a formula-based allocation to HFAs\n\nHUD obligated $2.25 billion in TCAP funds to HFAs. The HFAs were to award the funds competitively according to \ntheir qualified allocation plans, which explain selection criteria and application requirements for housing tax credits \n(as determined by the states and in accordance with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code). Projects that were \nawarded low- income housing tax credits in fiscal years 2007, 2008, or 2009 were eligible for TCAP funding, but \nHFAs had to give priority to projects that were \"shovel-ready\" and expected to be completed by February 2012. \nAlso, TCAP projects had to include some low-income tax credits and equity investment. HFAs must commit 75 \npercent of their TCAP awards by February 2010 and disburse 75 percent by February 2011. Project owners must \nspend all of their TCAP funds by February 2012. HUD can recapture TCAP funds from any HFA whose projects do \nnot comply with TCAP requirements. In these cases, HFAs are responsible for recapturing funds\n\nRecovery Act from project owners. Furthermore, because TCAP funds are federal financial assistance, they are \nsubject to certain federal requirements, such as Davis-Bacon and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). \nThese acts, respectively, require that projects receiving federal funds pay prevailing wages and meet federal \nenvironmental requirements\n\nThe Section 1602 Program allows HFAs to exchange returned and unused tax credits for a payment from Treasury \nat the rate of 85 cents for every tax credit dollar. HFAs can exchange up to 100 percent of unused 2008 credits and \n40 percent of their 2009 allocation. HFAs may award Section 1602 Program funds to finance the construction or \nacquisition and rehabilitation of qualified low-income buildings in accordance with the HFA's Qualified Allocation \nPlan, which establishes criteria for selecting LIHTC projects. Section 1602 Program funds may be committed to \nproject owners that have not sold their LIHTC allocation to private investors, as long as the project owner has made \ngood faith efforts to find an investor\n\nHowever, some HFAs have required Section 1602 Program projects to include some tax credit equity from private \ninvestors. Section 1602 Program funds are subject to the same requirements as the standard LIHTC program, and \nlike TCAP funds, may be recaptured if a project does not comply with the requirements. HFAs may submit \napplications to Treasury for Section 1602 Program funds through 2010. The last day for HFAs to commit funds to \nproject owners is December 31, 2010, but they can continue to disburse funds for committed projects through \nDecember 31, 2011, provided that the project owners paid or incurred at least 30 percent of eligible project costs by \nthe end of 2010. Congress appropriated 'such sums as may be necessary' for the operation of the Section 1602 \nProgram. The Joint Committee on Taxation originally estimated the budget impact of this program at $3 billion. As \nof the end of April 2010, however, Treasury had obligated more than $5 billion to HFAs in Section 1602 Program \n\n\n\nfunds. Section 1602 Program funds are not considered by Treasury to be federal financial assistance and, \ntherefore, the Section 1602 Program is not subject to many of the requirements placed on TCAP\n\nTitle IV-E Adoption Assistance and Foster Care Programs Administered by the Administration for Children and \nFamilies within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Foster Care Program helps states to provide \nsafe and stable out-of-home care for children until the children are safely returned home, placed permanently with \nadoptive families, or placed in other planned arrangements for permanency. The Adoption Assistance Program \nprovides funds to states to facilitate the timely placement of children, whose special needs or circumstances would \notherwise make placement difficult, with adoptive families. Federal\n\n28See the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) description in this appendix\n\nRecovery Act Title IV-E funds are paid to reimburse states for their maintenance payments using the states' \nrespective Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rates.28 The Recovery Act temporarily increased the \nFMAP rate effective October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, resulting in an estimated additional $806 million \nthat will be provided to states for the Adoption Assistance and Foster Care Programs\n\nTransportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery Discretionary Grants Administered by the Department of \nTransportation's Office of the Secretary, the Recovery Act provides $1.5 billion in competitive grants, generally \nbetween $20 million and $300 million, to state and local governments and transit agencies. These grants are for \ncapital investments in surface transportation infrastructure projects that will have a significant impact on the nation, \na metropolitan area, or a region. Projects eligible for funding provided under this program include, but are not \nlimited to, highway or bridge projects, public transportation projects, passenger and freight rail transportation \nprojects, and port infrastructure investments\n\nWater and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program The Water and Environmental Programs administered by the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Rural Development, provides loans, grants, and loan guarantees for drinking water, \nsanitary sewer, solid waste, and storm drainage facilities in rural areas and cities and towns of 10,000 or less. The \nRecovery Act provided nearly $3.3 billion in Rural Water and Waste Disposal funding for these programs. Loans, \ngrants and loan guarantees to rural water and waste systems will be used to construct, improve, rehabilitate, or \nexpand existing water and waste disposal systems to areas initially excluded because service was not economically \nfeasible\n\nWater Quality Management Planning Grants The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded $39.3 million in \nRecovery Act funding for Water Quality Management Planning Grants to assist states in water quality management \nplanning. Funds are used to determine the nature and extent of point and nonpoint source water pollution and to \ndevelop water quality management plans. Funded activities also include green infrastructure planning and \nintegrated water resources planning. The fund is administered by the Office of Water, EPA\n\nRecovery Act Weatherization Assistance Program The Recovery Act appropriated $5 billion for the Weatherization \nAssistance Program, which the Department of Energy (DOE) is distributing to each of the states, the District of \nColumbia, and seven territories and Indian tribes, to be spent by March 31, 2012. The program, administered by the \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within DOE, enables low-income families to reduce their utility \nbills by making long-term energy- efficiency improvements to their homes by, for example, installing insulation; \nsealing leaks; and modernizing heating equipment, air circulation fans, and air conditioning equipment. Over the \npast 33 years, the Weatherization Assistance Program has assisted more than 6.2 million low-income families. By \nreducing the energy bills of low- income families, the program allows these households to spend their money on \nother needs, according to DOE. The Recovery Act appropriation represents a significant increase for a program that \nhas received about $225 million per year in recent years. DOE has approved the weatherization plans of the 16 \nstates and the District of Columbia that are in our review and has provided at least half of the funds to those areas\n\nWildland Fire Management Program The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service administers the Wildland Fire \nManagement Program funding for projects on federal, state, and private land. The goals of these projects include \n\n\n\necosystem restoration, research, and rehabilitation; forest health and invasive species protection; and hazardous \nfuels reduction. The Recovery Act provided $500 million for the Wildland Fire Management program\n\nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998 Title I-B Grants The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) Youth, Adult, and \nDislocated Worker Programs, administered by the Employment and Training Administration within the Department \nof Labor (Labor), provide job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals. The \nRecovery Act provides an additional $2.95 billion in funding for Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker employment \nand training activities under Title I-B of WIA. These funds are allotted to states, which in turn allocate funds to local \nentities pursuant to formulas set out in WIA\n\nThe adult program provides training and related services to individuals ages 18 and older, the youth program \nprovides training and related services to low-income youth ages 14 to 21, and dislocated worker funds\n\n29In general, a dislocated worker is an individual who has been terminated or laid off, or who has received a notice \nof termination or layoff, from employment; was self-employed but is unemployed as a result of general economic \nconditions in the community in which the individual resides or because of natural disasters; or is a displaced \nhomemaker who is no longer supported by another family member. In addition, the Recovery Act provides that \nyouth up to age 24 may be served with Recovery Act funds\n\nRecovery Act provide training and related services to individuals who have been laid off or notified that they will be \nlaid off.29 Recovery Act funds can be used for all activities allowed under WIA, including core services, such as job \nsearch and placement assistance; intensive services, such as skill assessment and career counseling; and training \nservices, including occupational skills training, on-the-job training, registered apprenticeship, and customized \ntraining. For the youth program, Labor encouraged states and local areas to use as much of these funds as \npossible to expand summer youth employment opportunities. In addition, Labor advised states that training for \nadults and dislocated workers should be a significant focus for Recovery Act funds, and encouraged states to \nestablish policies to make supportive services and needs-related payments available for individuals who need these \nservices to participate in job training. To facilitate increased training for high- demand occupations, the Recovery \nAct expanded the methods for providing training under WIA and allowed local workforce boards to directly enter into \ncontracts with institutions of higher education and other training providers, if the local board determines that it would \nfacilitate the training of multiple individuals and the contract does not limit customer choice\n\nRecovery Act A A Appendix V GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments GAO Contacts J.
