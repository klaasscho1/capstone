Now, she's ready to \nhelp strangers.\n\nRafti, a 36-year-old accountant, read about the Daily News' immigrant helpline, and called to offer her services.\n\n\"I like helping people, and I think this is a great idea,\" the Brooklynite said.\n\nAfter a training session, Rafti, who speaks Albanian, Greek, Italian and English, started yesterday.\n\nIn its second day, more than 1,000 callers flooded the Citizenship Now phone line, looking for advice on how to get \non the path to U.S. citizenship.\n\nUnder the supervision of a pool of local attorneys, operators fielded phone calls from New York and beyond about \neverything from how to obtain U.S. immigration applications to how to fight a deportation order.\n\n\"There is an enormous, tremendous need for low-cost, free legal services for noncitizens,\" said Olivia Cassin, a \nstaff attorney at Legal Aid Society. \"People who are absolutely eligible to become a citizen don't know how to do it.\"\n\nNews columnist Allan Wernick, an attorney and director of CUNY's Citizenship and Immigration Project, which co-\nsponsors the helpline, said the project has dozens of more volunteers this time around.\n\n\"This shows the commitment of the immigrant service community,\" said Wernick, who is leading the panel of \nexperts. \"This shows how much education work still needs to be done.\"\n"}
