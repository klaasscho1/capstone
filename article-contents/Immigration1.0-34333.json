{"title": "IRANIAN DEMONSTRATORS AND DUE PROCESS", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nThe recent episode involving the mass arrest of nearly 200 pro-Khomeini demonstrators and their subsequent 10-\nday detention raises fundamental questions involving our nation's commitment to the constitutional guarantees of \nfree speech, assembly and due process of law.\n\nA large group of people were subjected to special immigration inquiries merely because of their participation in a \npolitical demonstration, and were detained without any reasonable basis to believe they were in violation of \nimmigration laws.\nAN-A\n\nOnly last year, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that an individual may not be detained by the police merely \nbecause he refuses to provide identification. That principle, basic to our concept of liberty, applies to I.N.S. officials \nas well as to the police.\n\nIndeed, a Federal court in New York held unconstitutional the I.N.S. practice of mass detentions of large numbers of \nsuspected aliens absent reasonable suspicion that each and every person so detained is an alien illegally present \nin the United States. The I.N.S. position vis-a-vis the Iranian demonstrators stands in stark contradiction to these \njudicial precedents.\n\nIt is a measure of the strength of our society that we can tolerate the exercise of free speech and assembly even by \nthose whose motivations may be questioned and with whom we may most vigorously disagree. Unfortunately, \nI.N.S. officials who have sworn to uphold the law have instead violated it.\n\nSTEVEN R. SHAPIRO, ARTHUR N.
