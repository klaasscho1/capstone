{"title": "California Stumbles On Bilingual Classes;Immigrant Pride", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nIt is interesting to note that 6 of the 13 students Brooklyn's Midwood High School posted as semifinalists in the \nWestinghouse Science Talent Search (news article, Jan. 13) were foreign born. In fact, two of the students arrived \nas refugees from the former Soviet Union less than seven years ago.\n\nThe vision, hard work and determination of these students reflect the spirit that so many newcomers share when \nthey arrive on our shores. Many of these youngsters had to learn a new language and adjust to a different home, \nculture and community, yet still they have excelled in school. These students are exemplary and remind us of the \nmerits of maintaining reasonable and generous immigration policies in the United States.\n\nWinning a place in the Westinghouse competition is just the first step of what promises to be a shining future for \nthese students and us. They will help make America even brighter.\n\n \n\nNORMAN D. TILLES\n\nPres., Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society\n\nNew York, Jan. 13, 1998\n"}
