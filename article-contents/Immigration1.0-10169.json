Because of her help, Ho, who had considered an abortion, decided against it.\nAJC\n\nThat was three years ago but the Chamblee resident, who moved to metro Atlanta in 1997, still cries when she \nrecalls that dark time.\n\n\"Without Sister Christine, I don't know how hard it would be,\" Ho, who speaks little English, said through an \ninterpreter.\n\nSince moving to Atlanta a decade ago, Truong, 49, has become one of the metro area's leading advocates for \nimmigrants. She speaks for those whose voices are least likely to be heard: poor families living in run-down \ntrailers, elderly people who don't speak English and parents frantic as their teenagers run away and sometimes \nvanish into street gangs.\n\nThrough her nonprofit organization, Good Shepherd Services, Truong helps immigrants throughout metro Atlanta. \nHer organization, which is funded through state and federal grants and private donations, provides a variety of \nservices. The organization has a $600,000 annual budget.\n\nThe centers help immigrants find jobs and child care, locate neighborhood Asian grocery stores or understand \ntheir child's report card.\n\nAnd Truong knows how to work the phones. Her calls to lawyers, judges and immigration officials often bring swifter \nresolution of green card and other legal problems.\n\n\n\"I think she's a second Mother Teresa,\" said Louise Radloff, chairwoman of the Gwinnett County school board, \nwhose district includes a large Vietnamese population. \"She's strong-willed, has tremendous convictions and is \nabsolutely committed to the people she serves.\"\n\nThe vast majority of immigrants who come to Good Shepherd centers for help are Vietnamese.\n\nStaffed with 13 full-time employees, Good Shepherd has offices in DeKalb and Gwinnett. A Clayton office is \nscheduled to open this month in response to the rising influx of Asian immigrants.\n\nGeorgia's Vietnamese population has more than tripled from 7,800 in 1990 to 29,000 in 2000, according to census \nfigures.\n\nRadloff said Truong encourages Vietnamese parents to get involved in their children's education. Good Shepherd \nruns an after-school program where kids do their homework until their parents get off work.\n\nDuring the summer, kids take part in summer programs that serve as day care for working parents.\n\nThe centers bustle with activity from morning to evening. Immigrants of all ages take English lessons, socialize and \nshare resources. Truong estimates that the centers assist more than 4,000 people a year.\n\n\"Sister Christine is trying to create something out of nothing,\" said Larry To, a member of the Good Shepherd \nadvisory board. \"She's not common folk, she's a person with a special mission in her life.\"\n\nSoft-spoken and diminutive, Truong says simply that she finds joy in \"reaching out to people who nobody pays \nattention to.\"\n\n\"She is teaching them how to fish for themselves,\" said Baoky Vu, a Vietnamese activist and officer in the local \nVietnamese American Public Affairs Committee. \"She is very much committed to the belief that everyone should \nhave the same human rights.\"\n\nTruong's mother died when she was 16. She lived with her father and six siblings in Saigon until joining the Sisters \nof Good Shepherd convent at age 20.\n\nTwo years later, Truong felt the tremors of bombs exploding around her and heard reports of people she knew \nbeing killed.\n\nWhile waiting for a chance to escape, she and other nuns rescued more than 150 orphans whose homes were \nbombed, she said. She huddled in a hotel room with the children for 24 hours until a plane was available to fly them \nout.\n\nTen days later Saigon fell.\n\nTruong did missionary work in Hong Kong and other places around the world for 15 years before settling in metro \nAtlanta. The rest of her family escaped Vietnam a few years after she did, settling in Texas.\n\nThere are more than 6,000 sisters in the Good Shepherd order worldwide, with about 150 provinces in the United \nStates and four in metro Atlanta.\n\nAlthough eager to bring attention to the struggles often faced by immigrants, Truong deflects the spotlight from \nherself.\n\n\"I'm just trying to give meaning to these people,\" she said.\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nPhoto:\n\nSister Christine Truong comforts Tram Hyunh, 7, at the Good Shepherd Services Center in Chamblee.
