The SPEAKER pro tempore \n(Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). Pursuant to House\n\n Resolution 725, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) \neach will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. HENSARLING. \nMadam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and \nextend their remarks and submit extraneous material on H.R. 1153, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER \npro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. {time} 0915 \nMr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in \nsupport of H.R. 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017. I would like to start out thanking my colleague, the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) for his tireless leadership on this issue, having ushered this very same \n\n\nlegislation through our committee in three different Congresses. The purpose of H.R. 1153 is simple: to provide \nmuch-needed regulatory red tape relief to our community financial institutions so they can serve their customers; so \nthey can provide them more mortgages. This is a straightforward piece of legislation. It is practical, it is necessary, \nand, Madam Speaker, it is bipartisan. Now, you may hear today, Madam Speaker, from some of our Democratic \ncolleagues that ``we oppose the bill.'' We heard that claim in the Rules Committee earlier this week. But I do find it \ninteresting that no amendments were offered during committee markup, nor were any amendments offered at the \nRules Committee. I remind all on the House floor, Madam Speaker, that the Financial Services Committee favorably \nreported this bill to the House with a strong bipartisan vote of 46-13, which means almost half of the Democrats on \nour committee supported this bill; and in the 113th Congress, Madam Speaker, this bill passed by voice vote--not a \nsingle objection. Madam Speaker, this bill would help make homeownership more affordable for working Americans \nand would promote access to affordable mortgage credit for low- and moderate-income families and first-time home \nbuyers. It does this while continuing to protect consumers. The Mortgage Choice Act is needed because the CFPB \nwrote a flawed and problematic definition that grossly miscalculates points and fees. The result is that many \nmortgage loans, particularly those for low- and moderate-income borrowers, would not meet the standards of a \nqualified mortgage and thus not get made. Currently, CFPB rules include affiliated title charges under a 3 percent \ncap when determining whether a mortgage is a qualified mortgage, but it doesn't include unaffiliated. This does not \nmake sense. The CFPB rules are detrimental, again, to low- and moderate- income borrowers and first-time home \nbuyers since they are more likely to have smaller loan amounts and, therefore, more easily trigger the 3 percent \ncap. That means under the current definition, many mortgage applicants will be denied homeownership \nopportunities simply because they do not fit into the government box; or the only mortgages in the alternative \navailable to them might be at far higher interest rates, making them unaffordable for many. In other words, the \nCFPB's defective definition has ended up protecting many consumers right out of their opportunity to buy a home. \nH.R. 1153, from the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), would change the way points and fees are calculated \nby excluding fees paid for affiliated title charges and escrow charges for insurance and taxes. That would, therefore, \nMadam Speaker, increase homeownership opportunities for borrowers by allowing more loans to meet the QM \nstandard. Let's not just listen to me, Madam Speaker. Let's listen to our community financial institutions that we \nexpect to help our constituents. A credit union from Washington explained how this was affecting everyday \nAmericans. They wrote: ``A member at our credit union wanted to buy down his rate on his mortgage with cash out \nof pocket at closing in order to lower the payments for his retirement. However, doing so would have made his total \npoints and fees higher than allowed under ATR/QM, and there was no allowable way around the problem.'' From \nmy native Texas, a community banker wrote in and said: ``The greatest frustration our customers have is our bank's \ninability to now make home loans. For years we made loans to people for the purchase of their homes. We would \ndo about one every other week. So it was not a large volume. It was a good service. We always made these loans \nto keep in our loan portfolio. We never sold any home loans, but with the new requirements for home loans, it has \ndriven us out of this kind of business. It has also taken us out of the construction lending on homes because we \ncannot risk the risk of a takeout commitment failing. The consumer is the loser.'' Indeed, that is true, Madam \nSpeaker. As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Huizenga has worked on this bill for the past two Congresses again. In the \n113th Congress, it passed by voice vote. It passed by an overwhelming majority of 286-140 in the 114th Congress. \nI trust the third time will be the charm. I urge all of my colleagues to do what is right for our constituents and to pass \nH.R. 1153 to provide open access for Americans to purchase a home. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam \nSpeaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1153, the so-called Mortgage Choice Act of 2017. Unfortunately, this bill \nis yet another attempt to undermine the strong consumer protections Democrats established under the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, taking us back to the days of the subprime bubble. While some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have forgotten those days, I haven't. I remember how predatory \nlenders targeted unsuspecting home buyers by hiding fees and obscuring loan costs, tricking them into exploding \nmortgages and locking them into loans that they really couldn't afford. Millions of home buyers were steered into \nhigh-cost, subprime loans even [[Page H908]] when they qualified for prime mortgages, and lenders didn't even \nbother to verify whether or not borrowers had the ability to repay their mortgages. They weren't required to do that, \nso they didn't. The end result was rampant fraud on a massive scale to millions of foreclosures and a tremendous \nloss of generational wealth, particularly for Black homeowners. Some of my constituents are still struggling and \ntrying to recover from the financial devastation that occurred during this financial crisis. The last thing Congress \nshould do is to open the door to a return to these fraudulent and harmful policies, yet that is exactly what H.R.\n\n\n\n 1153 would do. This bill seems like a technical fix to allow affiliated title insurance and settlement services firms to \nbe excluded from the qualified mortgage rule's 3 percent cap on upfront points and fees paid by borrowers. But \nmake no mistake, there is nothing technical about this. In fact, this bill would allow title insurance companies to jack \nup prices on borrowers and allow lenders to receive what would otherwise be illegal kickbacks. Under this bill, \nlenders, including repeat offender megabanks, like Wells Fargo, would have new opportunities to reap huge \nfinancial profits at their customers' expense by steering them into costly title insurance policies that have no cap on \nfees whatsoever. Prior to the enactment of Dodd-Frank, lenders were able to earn tremendous profits through \nlucrative kickbacks paid by their affiliates. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, prohibits giving a \nfee kickback or thing of value in exchange for a referral of business related to a real estate settlement service. But \nthis kickback prohibition does not apply to affiliated companies of lenders, like a title insurance firm. To avail \nthemselves of this kickback loophole, some lenders have bought or created businesses to enable them to profit \ndirectly from the relationship. So Dodd-Frank established the responsible underwriting practice of requiring lenders \nto verify a borrower's ability to repay when they originate a loan. Dodd-Frank also enabled lenders to obtain some \nlegal protections when making residential mortgages if those loans are considered a qualified mortgage or QM. To \nbe considered QM, a loan must have terms and conditions that are understandable to borrowers and not contain \npredatory features considered to be unfair or deceptive. QM loans, for example, can't be interest-only loans, longer \nthan 30 years, or have balloon payments. Specific to the bill we are considering today, the amount of upfront points \nand fees on QM loans cannot exceed 3 percent of the total amount of the loan. In short, QM loans are supposed to \nbe low risk, prudently underwritten, and free from the type of features associated with those predatory mortgages \nthat trapped borrowers in loans they couldn't afford and that led to the financial crisis. The points and fees cap \nincluded under the QM definition includes, among other things, real estate-related fees paid to affiliates of the \nlender for services, such as property appraisals, settlement services, and title insurance. Fees paid to affiliates of \nthe lender pose greater risks to borrowers since lenders cannot steer borrowers directly to their affiliates without \nopen competition, and higher prices charged by affiliates directly benefit the lenders. Affiliate title insurance is \nespecially problematic. The title insurance industry is notoriously opaque. Due to a lack of competition and readily \navailable information on terms and pricing, consumers do not shop around for title insurance as they might for other \nproducts and services. Megabanks, like Wells Fargo, have used title insurance to take advantage of consumers \nthrough illegal kickbacks schemes. The Consumer Bureau took an enforcement action in 2015 against Wells Fargo \nand JPMorgan Chase, ordering those megabanks to pay more than $24 million in civil penalties and more than $11 \nmillion to consumers harmed by their kickback schemes with Genuine Title, a now defunct title company. At the \ntime, Director Cordray said: ``These banks allowed their loan officers to focus on their own illegal financial gain \nrather than on treating consumers fairly. Our action today to address these practices should serve as a warning for \nall those in the mortgage market.'' Madam Speaker, these kickback schemes continue despite Congress' efforts to \nshut them down, and would likely increase if H.R. 1153 is enacted. Because H.R. 1153 would remove fees that are \ncharged by a lender's affiliate title insurance company from the QM fee cap, the bill directly encourages lenders to, \nonce again, steer borrowers to their affiliates so they can extract even more money from them. Now, supporters of \nthe bill argue that, because individual States provide adequate regulation over the title insurance industry, it is \nunnecessary, they say, to have additional safeguards related to affiliated title companies and the fees they charge. \nHowever, research from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows that State laws do not, by \nthemselves, offer robust protection to consumers with title insurance. More than half of all States don't even collect \ndata from title agents. Some States have ``no particular standard'' for determining whether title insurance rates are \nadequate, and even a couple, like Illinois and Arkansas, do not regulate title insurance rates at all. Congress should \nbe strengthening prohibitions on kickbacks, not weakening them. We should enable borrowers to get the best price, \nterms, and conditions on mortgage loans instead of creating more ways for these megabanks, like Wells Fargo, to \ngouge American consumers. When Congress considered this same measure last term, the Obama administration \nissued a veto threat, stating that the bill ``risked eroding consumer protections and returning the mortgage market to \nthe days of careless lending focused on short-term profits.'' Madam Speaker, buying a home is likely the largest \npurchase most consumers will ever make. For this reason alone, Congress should absolutely reject proposals like \nH.R. 1153 that would permit residential mortgage lenders to take advantage of borrowers trying to achieve the \nAmerican Dream. Finally, a long list of groups, including civil rights groups, such as the NAACP and the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights, as well as consumer groups at the National, State, and local level, like \nAmericans for Financial Reform, National Consumer Law Center, and the Center for Responsible Lending, all \noppose this so-called Mortgage Choice Act. So for all of these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in \n\n\n\nopposing H.R. 1153. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I \nyield myself 10 seconds to say that, if the ranking member would read section 8(a) of RESPA, she would realize \neverything she said was false because it prevents any fee, kickback, or thing of value. Second of all, what she \ndescribes as a harmful and fraudulent policy was supported by half of her Democrats, including her vice ranking \nmember, Mr. Kildee from Michigan. Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nHuizenga), who is the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on \nCapital Markets, Securities, and Investments. {time} 0930 Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support \nof H.R. 1153. As someone who worked in the housing industry, in fact, for the third generation, this is a very \nimportant issue to me and, more importantly, to all of our constituents across the country. The qualified \nmortgage/ability-to-repay rule, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, went into effect in January 2014. This QM rule \nis the primary means for mortgage lenders to satisfy its ability-to-repay requirements. Additionally, Dodd-Frank \nprovides that a QM may not have points and fees in excess of 3 percent of the loan amount. So far, so good. As \ncurrently defined, however, points and fees include, among other charges: salaries paid to loan officers; loan level \nprice adjustments, as the chairman was talking about, which are traditionally known as points; payments by lenders \nto correspondent banks, credit unions, [[Page H909]] and mortgage brokers in wholesale transactions; and, as has \nbeen discussed, fees paid to affiliated, but not unaffiliated, title companies; and--this is the one that is most bizarre \nof all--amounts of insurance and taxes held in escrow. That counts towards that 3 percent. As a result of this \nconfusing and problematic definition, many affiliated loans, particularly those made to low- and moderate-income \nborrowers, would not qualify as QMs. Without that designation, it is unlikely the loan would be made. And if it were, \nit would only be available at higher rates, due to the heightened liability risks. Consumers would lose the ability to \ntake advantage of the convenience and market efficiencies offered by one-stop shopping. Hardworking Americans \nutilize one-stop shopping every day. They partake in it. For example, in west Michigan, we have the headquarters of \nMeijer. It is a great regional supermarket chain, and it is where families across the Midwest go to buy groceries, pick \nup clothes for the kids, and pick up auto parts. It is one-stop shopping that allows you to get just about everything \nyou need for your home. Well, purchasing a home is one of the most important decisions a family makes. Why \nshouldn't they have the same ability to take advantage of that same cost-effective convenience of one-stop \nshopping when buying a home? I, along with Representative Gregory Meeks, reintroduced H.R. 1153, bipartisan \nlegislation to modify and clarify the way points and fees are calculated and help families across America to one-stop \nshop. This legislation is narrowly focused to promote access to affordable mortgage credit without overturning the \nimportant consumer protections and sound underwriting required under Dodd-Frank's ability-to-repay provisions. As \nthe chairman pointed out, also. The RESPA provisions that are Federal law stay in place. Very similar legislation \noverwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives last Congress as well as in the 113th. I think it is important to \nnote that when we first introduced this bill in 2012, it looked substantially different. However, working with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, we worked together to improve the legislation. The result has been a truly \nbipartisan effort at every step of the way in the legislative debate. Specifically, H.R. 1153 would do a couple of \nthings. It would provide equal treatment for affiliated versus unaffiliated title fees. It doesn't change the 44 States \nthat have a regulated title insurance cost structure. It doesn't change any of those costs that a homeowner would \nhave. It just allows them to actually go lower, rather than higher. It also clarifies the treatment of insurance held in \nescrow. These two simple, commonsense changes will promote access to affordable mortgage credit for low- and \nmoderate-income families and, indeed, all families, especially first-time home buyers, by ensuring that safe, \nproperly underwritten mortgages pass the QM test. Whether or not you supported Dodd-Frank, it is clear that the \nlaw is going to require some tweaks to ensure qualified borrowers aren't locked out of home ownership and the \nbeneficial features of a qualified mortgage. The QM represents the best mortgage on the market. It is the gold \nstandard. And it should be the gold standard. We should want more responsible people getting QMs, not fewer. \nQuite frankly, this is something we should all agree on. In fact, we did last year. Our bill doesn't touch any of the \nCFPB's strict underwriting criteria. It doesn't, in any way, suspend a lender's legal requirement to determine that a \nborrower has the ability to repay that loan. The ranking member points out a real problem that happened in the \nindustry and that, frankly, many of us in the industry warned of, but this does nothing that allows State regulated title \ninsurance to be violated or any of those Federal steps regarding the qualified mortgage. It, in no way, sidesteps \nRESPA or QM requirements. Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I am completely baffled by the ranking member's new \nopposition to this bill. This bill was very carefully negotiated in order to receive bipartisan support, which the ranking \nmember voted for previously. In fact, she was so supportive that she, along with 11 other Democrats from the \ncommittee, sent a letter, dated August 1, 2014, to the Senate urging them to ``quickly adopt the Mortgage Choice \n\n\n\nAct.'' Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter of August 1, 2014. House of Representatives, Washington, DC, \nAugust 1, 2014. Dear Majority Leader Reid, Chairman Johnson and Members of the Senate Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs: On June 9, the House passed the Mortgage Choice Act (H.R.\n\n      3211), on the suspension calendar without objection. Senators Manchin and Johanns introduced a companion \nbill, S. 1577 in October, but it has not yet been considered. We support the Mortgage Choice Act because of our \nconcern about lower-income consumers' access to credit and their ability to select the mortgage and title insurance \nproviders of their choice. Passage of H.R. 3211 represents the fourth time that the House has approved virtually \nidentical legislation without objection. In 2007 and 2009, a Democratic House majority passed essentially the same \nprovision in the Miller-Watt- Frank anti-predatory lending legislation, and then a third time as part of the House's \nversion of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010. The Mortgage Choice Act \nsimply excludes the cost of title insurance from the definition of points and fees under the Truth in Lending Act \nregardless of whether a title insurance agent is affiliated with a mortgage lender or not. It also clarifies that funds \nheld in escrow for the payment of property insurance do not count as ``points and fees.'' The legislation is needed \nto ensure that smaller loans to creditworthy low and moderate-income consumers can select the mortgage lender \nand title insurance provider of their choice and obtain a ``qualified mortgage,'' the gold standard for all mortgages. \nThe bill authorizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to implement rules governing the exclusion of \nreasonable title insurance charges from ``points and fees.'' It preserves the Bureau's strong enforcement authority \nto require transparency and disclosure of affiliations and charges under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act \n(RESPA). In fact, the CFPB has been vigorous in its pursuit of RESPA violations, ranging from minor disclosure \nerrors to kick-backs for referrals by an unaffiliated title company. We urge you and the entire Senate to quickly \nadopt the Mortgage Choice Act to improve access to credit, enhance competition among title insurance providers, \nand reinforce the CFPB's authority to define what title insurance costs qualify as excludable ``points and fees.'' \nSincerely, David Scott; Maxine Waters; Emanuel Cleaver; Henry Cuellar; Daniel T. Kildee; Jim McDermott; Patrick \nMurphy; Gerald E. Connolly; Michael F. Doyle; Betty McCollum; Gregory W. Meeks; Gary C. Peters. Mr. \nHUIZENGA. In the letter, she stated that the bill would ``improve access to credit'' and ``enhance competition \namong title insurance providers.'' Well, I couldn't agree more with the ranking member. She talks now of kickbacks. \nI am confused as to how an affiliated title structure, pricing structure, versus an unaffiliated title purchase is \nsomehow a kickback. I am confused at how an escrow, money that is ours that is put into a holding account to be \nused later to pay off debt, is a kickback. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Donovan). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an additional 30 seconds. Mr. \nHUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I wish I had time to yield to the gentlewoman to hear that answer. She is talking about \nmegabanks. This is, frankly, just a red herring in this whole thing. Congress has the opportunity to help more \nAmericans realize a portion of the American Dream, not by some grandiose law or decree, but by simply reforming \na burdensome regulation. Home ownership has been a pillar in American life for generations. Today, we can \nreaffirm that pillar and reassert that home ownership can and should be an attainable goal. Mr. Speaker, I thank my \ncolleague, Representative Meeks, and many others who have worked so tirelessly on this to fix this flawed \nprovision, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1153. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. \nSpeaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the chairman. [[Page \nH910]] He said that RESPA prohibits kickbacks. While RESPA prohibits paying kickbacks to third-party title \nagencies, the law does not prohibit payments to affiliated title firms. This incentivizes a title agency to be affiliated \nso it can gain the payment option without violating RESPA, including affiliated title insurance fees in the QM defines \npoints and fees caps, provides important market pressure to control costs for consumers, and supports access to \ncredits. By the way, when we talk about RESPA, we are talking about the real estate settlement procedures that \ndefine all of this. So let's be clear again that, while RESPA prohibits paying kickbacks to third-party title agents, the \nlaw does not prohibit payments to affiliated title firms. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. \nHENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), chairman of the \nFinancial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. LEUTKEMEYER. Mr. \nSpeaker, I want to start by thanking the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). He has worked on this bill for \nsome time, and I appreciate his commitment to the issue of access to mortgage credit. His background is such that \nhe understands this issue, being in the real estate business and the retail development business. So this is \nsomething he is passionate about and really has an in-depth knowledge of. I know Mr. Huizenga has seen in \nMichigan what I have seen in Missouri and around the Nation: the regulatory regime governing the mortgage \n\n\n\nmarket is growing overly complex and becoming, as a result, inaccessible for far too many borrowers. In a Financial \nInstitutions Subcommittee hearing held earlier this year, we had a situation where a credit union executive came in \nand had a huge file about 3-inches thick. I asked him: Can you tell me how many pages are in that file? He said: \nCongressman, we no longer measure by the page; we measure by the pound. That is how out of whack our system \nhas become with regard to trying to make home mortgage loans. These regulatory burdens associated with making \nhome loans have forced many institutions completely out of the market altogether. I have a number of banks in my \narea that no longer make home loans because of these overly burdensome rules and regulations and costs that \nhave to be passed onto the consumers. The CFPB's qualified mortgage rule has had particular success in limiting \naccess to mortgage credit for many consumers who may otherwise be deemed to be qualified borrowers. The \nMortgage Choice Act seeks to change some of this by increasing competition in the mortgage and title insurance \nmarkets. This bipartisan legislation does so by clarifying and recalibrating the points and fees limitations included in \nthe Dodd- Frank qualified mortgage framework. The current situation doesn't make sense, Mr. Speaker. If a \nconsumer chooses an unaffiliated title insurance provider, the transaction doesn't count towards points and fees. \nBut if that consumer chooses to work with an affiliated provider, it does. Despite what you may hear, this arbitrary \nstipulation in the points and fees definition doesn't protect consumers. It punishes them by limiting and, in some \ncases, eliminating mortgage and housing options, pushing more and more loans farther and farther away from QM \nstatus. Like too many of the rules handed out by the CFPB, it is the consumer that loses. Simply put, the goal of \nH.R. 1153 is to help low-and middle-income borrowers as well as prospective first-time buyers realize the American \nDream: owning their own home. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his leadership on this issue. I urge strong \nsupport for the legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. \nHENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chair of the \nCommittee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. \n1153, the Mortgage Choice Act, provides needed clarity to the calculation of points and fees for qualified \nmortgages, or QM, especially for those companies affiliated with real estate brokers. Established under the ability-\nto-repay/QM section of the Truth in Lending Act, H.R. 1153 would amend the definition of points and fees and allow \nmore loans to qualify, thus increasing choices for all borrowers. Chairman Huizenga's bipartisan legislation does not \ncreate a QM loophole like some would argue. Instead, H.R. 1153 rightly attempts to level the playing field, \nregardless of whether the lender is affiliated with a title agency or not. In addition, H.R. 1153 does not allow high-\ncost loans to qualify as QMs. By allowing loans with the same points and fees to be treated equally under the law, \nChairman Huizenga's bill corrects one of the many flaws of the post-Dodd-Frank era. Thanks to the Mortgage \nChoice Act, it will now be easier for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy a home. I commend my colleague, \nChairman Huizenga, for his bipartisan work on this issue, and I urge all Members to support this legislation. Ms. \nMAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, for the life \nof me, I cannot understand why my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle would be in support of anything that \nwould cause a home buyer to have to pay more money in fees when they are taking out a mortgage. On a \n$400,000 mortgage, you are talking about you want to go beyond a $12,000 cap, which is 3 percent? Why would \nyou want to do that to a homeowner? What we are saying is, under QM and what we worked so hard to establish, \nwas to put a cap on all of these fees so that the homeowners, the home buyers, would not be paying more than 3 \npercent of that mortgage. We think that is fair. Now you want to open up the flood gates so that these title \ncompanies can increase the amount of that they are charging and go beyond the 3 percent. How much higher do \nyou want it to go? Do you want them to be able to go up to 4 percent or 5 percent with these homeowners who are \npaying downpayments and who are trying to get into homes? Why is it you want to expand beyond a 3 percent cap \non the average hardworking home buyer in this country? I don't get it. I don't understand it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve \nthe balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nRothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. \n{time} 0945 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R.\n\n 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act. As a cosponsor of the bill and the vice chairman of the Financial Institutions and \nConsumer Credit Subcommittee, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support its passage. As we all know, \ncommunity financial institutions continue to close or merge at an alarming rate. We just saw an article the other day \nthat about 1,700 branches across the country have closed, and to go through some of the towns in western \nPennsylvania where you see the only branch closed is striking. As we all know, community financial institutions \ncontinue to close or merge at an alarming rate. Bit by bit, families across America are losing access to vital financial \n\n\n\nproducts like home mortgages. Regulations like the qualified mortgage, or QM rule, make it even harder for \nAmericans to get a mortgage and realize the dream of homeownership. For small mortgages, points and fees can \noften exceed 3 percent, which leads these mortgages to be designated as higher priced non-QM loans. This \ndiscourages financial institutions from lending to Americans with moderate incomes and first-time home buyers; that \nis why, because loans aren't there. Chairman Huizenga's bill wisely addresses this issue by excluding several items \nfrom the calculation of QM [[Page H911]] points and fees. The bill excludes charges paid to an affiliate of the lender \nfor title examination or title insurance services and insurance premiums held in escrow. By excluding these items \nfrom the calculation, the bill will allow more loans to qualify as QM, opening up more credit to potential home \nbuyers, and it will facilitate one-stop shopping. This is good for the community financial institutions that many \nAmericans rely on for their financial service products. It will help our constituents back home access the funds they \nneed to accomplish the dream of homeownership. Chairman Huizenga's legislation provides smart, targeted relief \nfrom the unintended consequences of burdensome regulations. Again, banks aren't making loans. We want to \nencourage those first-time home buyers, the moderate-income home buyers to be able to have access to \nmortgages. That is why I support this bill, and I again urge my colleagues to vote for the Mortgage Choice Act. Ms. \nMAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I don't think I heard my \ncolleague correctly when he said that this bill had something to do with encouraging first-time home buyers. It has \nnothing to do with encouraging first-time home buyers. As a matter of fact, if we proceed with this bill that is before \nus today that they are supporting, it will discourage first-time home buyers and home buyers in general because \nwhat they are doing is they are increasing the possibility for more points and fees that have to be paid when we \nhave a cap now at 3 percent, which any reasonable person would know makes good sense. Mr. Speaker, I reserve \nthe balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nTrott), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan, \ncommonsense Mortgage Choice Act, sponsored by the Congressman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). Mr. Speaker, I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which will make mortgages more affordable for low- and moderate-\nincome families. In the wake of the financial crisis, Congress directed the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, to create a definition for so- called qualified mortgages. Congress wanted to ensure that consumers were \nnot sold predatory loans and that good faith investors were not buying mortgages designed to fail. Unfortunately, \nthe Bureau's rulemaking drove originators from the industry and made loans more expensive in the process. This \nburden will fall mostly on low- and middle-income families, the very people the CFPB was created to help. The rule \npromulgated by the CFPB czar limits consumer options, causes consumers to pay more, and does nothing to make \nmortgages any safer. It is this sort of illogical rulemaking that makes Michiganders more and more frustrated by \nwhat they see in Washington. We need to ensure that our government prosecutes fraud, predatory lending, and \nunethical practices, but it should not be in the business of undermining an industry that plays such a critical role in \nthe dream of homeownership. You know, when mortgages become more expensive, it is America's low- and \nmiddle-income families that suffer the most. Homeownership is the cornerstone of the American Dream. It builds \ncommunities, provides families with stability, and, hopefully, creates equity for retirement. The government should \nbe helping this dream, not creating silly, illogical obstacles. Over the past several years, I have worked with my \ncolleagues to refocus the Bureau on its core mission of protecting consumers. I am glad that Acting Director \nMulvaney has begun to do so, and I am encouraged that Congress is doing its part to rein in this rogue \nbureaucracy. This bill does nothing to threaten the underlying safety of the QM rule and does not erode vital \nconsumer protections. It simply helps ensure that consumers have choices to reduce their mortgage costs along the \nway. Now, the ranking member opposes this bill, as she believes it will usher in a new era of fraudulent subprime, \ndangerous loans riddled with kickbacks and inflated title fees. I am not sure how money held in escrow would ever \nbe a kickback, and her description of the title industry is completely incorrect. It is a highly regulated industry in \nmost States, and the State that she mentioned, Illinois, is extremely competitive and extremely regulated. I am not \nsure what bill the ranking member believes we are debating today, but the Mortgage Choice Act will not result in \nany of the problems she describes--all great scare tactics, great theater, a great political sound bite, but, \nunfortunately, all fiction, all inaccurate. Her flip-flop on this bill is at least, at the minimum, very puzzling; but, if \neverything she says is correct, I certainly feel bad for all the Democrats. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of \nthe gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nMichigan. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I feel bad, if everything she says is true, for all the Democrats who \nunanimously passed this bill in the 113th Congress. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better than a \npartisan discussion about something that is nothing more than a technical correction of an unintended \n\n\n\nconsequence. Again, I thank my friend, Mr. Huizenga, for his leadership, and I encourage all of my colleagues to \njoin in supporting this bipartisan solution. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume. My friends on the opposite side of the aisle just dislike qualified mortgage. They dislike QM. And \na lot of the arguments that you have heard had nothing to do, really, with this bill, itself, but more with the fact that \nthey have always wanted to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who has the responsibility of \nimplementing QM. So they will talk about everything from access to credit to you name it, but it has nothing to do \nwith the fact that they are here with a bill that is trying to open up opportunities for affiliated title companies to be \nable to charge home buyers more money than would be allowed under QM. The fact of the matter is we have a 3 \npercent cap on all points and fees in the legislation that we created to protect homeowners--3 percent. Why is it \nthey want to open it up so that home buyers have to pay more than 3 percent on all of these points and fees? As a \nmatter of fact, I get questions all the time, particularly from first-time home buyers asking me: What are all these \npoints and fees that I have to pay? Do you mean to tell me that on a $400,000 loan, they are going to rip off \n$12,000 on points and fees or more? And we have to explain that we have kept it to 3 percent. But now they want \nto open up the floodgates, and they want to say that these affiliated companies can charge more on points and fees \nas it relates to title insurance. So I am opposed to it. And for those who did not understand, who may have voted \nbecause of the way that is oftentimes presented by the opposite side of the aisle--and, as a matter of fact, it is \nobscured in the way that they present it in talking about trying to help homeowners, trying to protect homeowners, \ntrying to open up opportunities. It has nothing to do with any of that. This is because the title insurance people who \nhave wielded their influence have come here to change the law so that they can raise those rates and charge more \nmoney and have kickbacks, et cetera, et cetera. This is what this is all about. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a \nhardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my \nsupport for H.R.\n\n 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act. This bill is another example of a rollback of the burdensome regulations of Dodd-\nFrank and, many would say, unintended consequences. The 113th Congress, as Mr. Huizenga reported out--\napparently, the Member opposed feels that her colleagues were [[Page H912]] confused in the 113th Congress \nwhen they unanimously supported this very same procedure, this same change to Dodd-Frank. Apparently, all of \nPresident Obama's supporters were also confused into forgetting to make the big investments they have made as a \nreaction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was recently enacted. So confusion must be rampant, but let me clarify \nwhat this does. It doesn't do the things that the Member opposed accuses it of doing. Frankly, the market prevails \nhere, not price controls from Washington, D.C., nor a substitute that would say a nonaffiliated company could offer \nthe exact same product that the one-stop shop is barred from offering. So rather than have a simple procedure \nwhere a borrower could work with one lending institution, they are forced to this array that resembles the healthcare \nindustry, where, instead of getting one bill from one visit, you show up to do a mortgage and you get a bill from five \nor six different entities, and it makes it more confusing. The market lets people shop and say, ``Hey, maybe I could \nget this product from someone else,'' but, unfortunately, without this change, it blocks hardworking families from \nworking with one relationship to close on their mortgage. It adds one more piece in the web of documentation \nrequired, and it adds one more thing to negotiate in the relationship that is necessary to close on a mortgage. The \nQM rule should not stand for ``quitting mortgages.'' It should stand for ``qualified mortgages.'' The application of this \nhas resulted in small and community banks quitting the mortgage market for certain types of loans, and this is \nhurting the families that the Member opposed says she seeks to help. I urge all of my colleagues to unite and \nsupport this rational, limited modification that lets the market work the way the market can work for the hardworking \nfamilies of America. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nTry as they may, they cannot explain to anyone why it is they want to open up the opportunity for these affiliated \ncompanies to charge more on these title loans. As a matter of fact, again, I am going to keep reminding everyone \nwho is listening that, under Dodd-Frank, under the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under the \nqualified mortgage rule, all of the work that was done after this country found itself in a position of where we were in \na recession, almost a depression because of what we had allowed to happen in this country from some of the \nbiggest banks and financial institutions in the world, we discovered that there were all kind of exotic loans, all kind of \ndifferent kinds of loans that were put together to entice consumers and home buyers to take out these mortgages. \nWe heard about all of them: no-documentation loans where they didn't even know where the consumer, the \nhomeowner was going to get their money from; they did not vet them, they did not know their employment history, \n\n\n\nand on and on and on. So the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is absolutely carrying out the work of what \nDodd-Frank was intended to do, and that is to reform all of this and to make sure that consumers are treated fairly, \nto make sure that consumers are not ripped off, to make sure that consumers don't have a whole list of these fees \nand points before they can even get their downpayments, incredibly, and have to pay over 3 percent and more in \nthese points and fees as they are trying to access a mortgage. {time} 1000 This is all about keeping the cap on the \n3 percent for all of those points and fees. If you do what this bill is intended to do, you are saying that you are \nopening up the opportunity for these points and fees to be increased because of these affiliated companies that \nwant to take the cap off. I don't know how better to explain that. My friends on the opposite side of the aisle would \ncharge consumers more with this bill. We on this side of the aisle are opposed with that. We are saying that it is not \nfair to consumers. What you need to do is let Dodd-Frank reforms work so that we can protect our consumers and \nnot have them gouged and increase the amount of money they have to pay in these points and fees. Mr. Speaker, I \nreserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased now to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), a cosponsor of the legislation and a great friend of the Financial \nServices Committee. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 1153, the Mortgage Choice \nAct of 2017. This bipartisan legislation is essential to help low- and middle- income families gain access to qualified \nmortgages. I commend Chairman Hensarling and Congressman Huizenga for their work on shepherding this bill \nthrough the legislative process. Policymaking is complex, and Congress and Federal regulators do not always get \nit right. We need to sometimes make changes to address new issues and unintended consequences that arise. As \nwe have seen for the past few years, the Dodd-Frank Act--and let me add that there are many of us in the real \nestate business and on bank boards who saw the effects of Dodd-Frank not allowing banks to go into the \ncommunities that need them the most--contains certain provisions that fit one or both of these categories and must \nbe changed through legislative action. One of these policies is the CFPB's qualified mortgage, or QM, rule. The \nQM rule is intended to protect lenders from legal liability and provide compliance certainty for mortgage loans that \nare low risk and meet certain criteria. One of those criterion requires a mortgage loan's total points and fees not to \nbe in excess of 3 percent of the loan's value. Unfortunately, the points and fees rule often depends on who is \nmaking the loan and how title insurance is obtained, which is confusing for both consumers and businesses \nproviding these services. Also, as has been mentioned, insurance premiums held in escrow are considered points \nand fees under the QM rule, which is ridiculous. That is like saying that a parent who puts money in for a 529 \nsavings plan for his children's education is a car payment or a mortgage payment. It doesn't make sense, but it \ndiscourages consumers from using this important financial management tool. H.R. 1153 would address these \nunintended consequences and provide clarity for borrowers and businesses. I am also confident that the CFPB, \nunder the leadership of Mick Mulvaney, will ensure that this clarification is effectively implemented if this bill is \nenacted into law. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense fix so that we can get the policy \nright and address the unintended consequences arising from the future rule. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. \nMr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. \nMr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I congratulate her on her extraordinary leadership as the \nranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. She has been a champion for America's working families, \nprotecting consumers, protecting the taxpayer, and doing so in a very balanced way, sensitive to the needs of all \nparties concerned. I am so proud of her leadership and her service. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bad bill \nfor hardworking Americans that is on the floor today. The cynically named Mortgage Choice Act provides anything \nbut choice. Instead, it raises costs on consumers who have few alternatives. This is yet another attempt to stack the \ndeck even further against working families. Mr. Speaker, this debate is another waste of time. Every day, \ncourageous, patriotic DREAMers lose their status, and, every day, the American dream slips further out of reach. \nAs Members of Congress, we have a moral responsibility to act now to protect DREAMers, who are the pride of our \nNation and are American in every way but on paper. I use this occasion as opposing this bill to speak further about \nsocial justice in America. The American people want Congress to pass a Dream Act: Eighty-four percent of \nAmericans support a path to citizenship for [[Page H913]] DREAMers or permanent status; 88 percent of \nIndependents back the path of citizenship or permanent status; and 70 percent of Republicans back either \ncitizenship or permanent status. The three Bs--business; badges, our law enforcement community; and Bibles--are \nimploring Congress to pass a Dream Act. Earlier this month, I stood with evangelical leaders to call on the Speaker \nto bring the Dream Act to a vote for the sake of family fairness and respect for the spark of divinity within every \nperson. There is nothing partisan or political about protecting DREAMers. If a Dream Act were brought to the floor, \nit would pass immediately with strong, bipartisan support. I commend my Republican colleagues for their courage in \n\n\n\nspeaking out on this, yet our DREAMers hang in limbo with a cruel cloud of fear and uncertainty above them. The \nRepublican moral cowardice must end. Members of Congress are trustees of the people and of our Nation. Why are \nwe here if not to protect the patriotic young people who are determined to contribute and to strengthen America? So \nI am going to go on as long as my leadership minute allows. I would like to speak to the Bible in Luke 10:25-37, the \nparable of the Good Samaritan. On one occasion, an expert of the law stood up to test Jesus. ``Teacher,'' he asked, \n``what must I do to inherit eternal life?'' ``What is written in the law,'' Jesus replied, ``How do you read it?'' The \nlawyer answered: ``Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, with all \nyour mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.'' Jesus responded: ``You have answered correctly. Do this and you \nwill live.'' But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus: ``And who is my neighbor?'' In reply, Jesus said: ``A \nman going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. When he was attacked by robbers, they stripped him of his clothes, \nbeat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he \nsaw the man, he passed on to the other side of the road. So, too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, \npassed on to the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was, and when he saw him, he \ntook pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine. And then he put the man on his \nown donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day, he took out two Denarii and gave them to \nthe innkeeper. Look after him, and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have. Which \nof these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?'' The expert of the law \nreplied: ``The man who had mercy on him.'' Jesus told him: ``Go and do likewise.'' The parable of the Good \nSamaritan is one that has been used over and over again to welcome strangers. Samaritans were not friends to the \nperson that the Samaritan saved, but he was a man of justice. We all know how proud we are of America, as a land \nof opportunity and the land of the American Dream, which, for decades and centuries, really, has attracted people \nto our shores, to make the future better for their families. In doing so, they subscribe to the vows of our Founders. \n``A new order of the ages,'' it says, on the great seal of the United States, a new order, ``Novus Ordo Seclorum.'' \nThat meant that it was predicated on the idea that every generation would take responsibility to make the future \nbetter for the next. It became known as the American Dream and people flocked to our shores, bringing their \ndetermination, their optimism, their hope, and their courage, to make the future better for their families. In doing so, \nas I said, they subscribed to the values of our Founders to make the future better. That is why our country would be \na new order for the ages. How proud we are to have the Statue of Liberty welcoming people to our shores. In the \nwords of Emma Lazarus inscribed on the statue, it says: Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering \nlimbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, \nwhose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows worldwide \nwelcome; her mild eyes command. . . . Words that are music to the ears of everyone who loves freedom. ``Keep \nancient lands, your storied pomp!'' cries she With silent lips. ``Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses \nyearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to \nme, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'' With those words, America has been a beacon to the world, and how \nproud it has made us. America is great, some say, because America is good; and this manifestation of our \ngoodness is one that is historic. In responding to the call of our Statue of Liberty--who must, by now, have tears in \nher eyes, having heard some of the debate on immigration--I want to read about some of the DREAMers, who \ncame to our shores, maybe through land or by sea. I want to talk about Luis Galvan. Luis came to the United \nStates when he was 5 years old and grew up in poverty. Today, he is an agriculture ambassador at College of the \nSequoias and is working to help students improve their grades. Following the repeal of DACA, Luis constantly \nworries about his ability to continue working in order to afford his education. He is one of four siblings also attending \ncollege, who are also DACA recipients. Jacqueline Romo's DACA expires this month. Jacqueline was raised in the \ncity of Chicago. She is an undocumented American aspiring to earn a bachelor's degree in graphic design. Her \neducation is her priority ever since she was in elementary school. Throughout high school, she had serious doubts \nabout her future, due to her status, but it never stopped her from pursuing higher education. Jacqueline went on to \ncommunity college, working a part-time job and earning a few scholarships that eventually added up to affordable \ntuition. Her mother, a single mother, would not be able to contribute to Jacqueline's education after high school, so \nit was Jacqueline's choice and responsibility to work her way financially through college. Thanks to scholarships \nlike the Illinois Dream Fund, TheDream.US, and other community scholarships, Jacqueline was lucky to follow \nthrough higher education, something that most of her undocumented peers would not have the chance to do. \nJacqueline's dreams are the same dreams of other undocumented Americans to persevere in this great country. \nHector Rivera Suarez is a DACA recipient from Greensboro, North Carolina. He has been a DACA recipient for the \n\n\n\npast 6 years. This came to an end on January 21. He is currently on track to graduate in May, with a degree in \nphilosophy and education. As a student body president and honor scholar at Guilford College, it is part of his \ncurriculum to serve in the local community. He has served as an afterschool tutor at a local community center that \nservices predominantly the Latino community, as well as assisting in classrooms at a newcomer school. His plan \nafter graduation is to enroll in Teach for America, since it is his only opportunity to be a teacher while being a DACA \nrecipient. Once DACA was rescinded in September, these plans had to be delayed. Without DACA, he will not have \nthe opportunity to keep serving the community in greater ways. {time} 1015 Hector's DACA expires 5 days before \nthe Teach For America January deadline; this is why he needs there to be a resolution as soon as possible so he \ncan move forward with his plans of mentoring the future leaders of America. Mr. Speaker, I bring this up because, \nas you know, the discussions and negotiations on the caps bill, the budget bill, are making progress and, perhaps, \nsoon to be coming to an end. And on that score, I would say so far as what I know of it, the budget caps agreement, \nwhich will be announced today, includes many Democratic priorities, actually bipartisan priorities. But with the \ndisaster recovery package and dollar-for-dollar increases in the defense and nondefense budget, Democrats have \nsecured hundreds of billions of dollars to invest in communities across America. There will be billions in funding to \nfight opioids, to strengthen our veterans and the NIH, to build job-creating rural infrastructure and broadband, and to \nfund access [[Page H914]] to child care and quality higher education. That is something that has been negotiated \nwith our input between Leader Mitch McConnell and Leader Chuck Schumer. But Mitch McConnell also made a \ncommitment to his Members that he would bring up a dream bill to the floor of the Senate in an appointed time. So \nwhy can't we have some kind of a commitment on this side of the aisle that enabled the discussion to take place on \na values-based place? Here, we asked the Speaker would he bring up the Hurd-Aguilar bill, which is bipartisan, \nwould win if brought to the House, has a sufficient number of Republican cosponsors, thank them for their courage \nto be public, but others who have said they would vote for it, and we would like a commitment from the Speaker to \nbring it and any other bills that he believes should be considered on the floor as well. We could do it under a \n``Queen of the Hill'' where the bill with the most votes becomes the most prevailing bill to either support what the \nSenate has done or to reconcile what the Senate has done. That is a simple request. That is a simple request that \nthe House Democrats and, in a bipartisan way, others have joined in asking the Speaker to bring a bill to the floor to \ngive us that commitment. Why should we, in the House, be treated in such a humiliating way, when the Republican \nSenate leader has given that opportunity, in a bipartisan way, to his membership? What is wrong? There is \nsomething wrong with this picture. That is why, this morning, when we took a measure of our caucus on support for \nthe package--well, we have to see all the particulars of it yet, but there are good things in it--that it does nothing to \neven advance, even with a commitment, without having passed the legislation first, to advance bipartisan legislation \nto protect DREAMers in this House. Without that commitment from Speaker Ryan, comparable to the commitment \nfrom Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support, nor does it have the support of a large number of \nmembers of our caucus. So then I go on to some other--I always am reminded in all of these debates about our \ncommitment to faith. In God We Trust, it says there right over the Speaker's chair. The Gospel of Matthew has been \nan inspiration to many of us on both sides of the aisle in terms of what our values are and how we make choices. \nAnd when, in the Gospel of Matthew, he writes: ``When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with \nHim, He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people \none from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on His right and the \ngoats on His left. Then the King will say to those on His right, `Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your \ninheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'' Then Christ goes on to say: ``For I was \nhungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and \nyou invited me in. I needed clothes and you clothed me. I was sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you \ncame to visit me. ``Then the righteous will answer him, `Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty \nand give you something to drink?' '' And the Lord says, when you see us--what did you see, a stranger and invite \nhim in or need clothing and clothing you, he's asking the Lord. And when did you see sick and in prison, and did I \nvisit you? ``The King will reply, `Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of \nmine, you did for me.' '' That is always important. Everybody knows that, the least of my brethren speech. However, \nthe King does go on: ``Then he will say to those on his left, `Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal \nfire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you \ngave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, \nI was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' ``They also will answer, `Lord, when did we see you hungry \nor thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' ``He will reply, `Truly I tell you, \n\n\n\nwhatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' '' It is not only positive of what you did, \nyou did for me; it is what you did not do. When I was a stranger, you did not help. Then it will go into eternal \npunishment. The righteous will go into eternal life. So anyway, more stories about our DREAMers and why they \nhonor the vows of our Founders, why they deserve our support. We are just talking about this discrete group of \npeople, how they command the support of the American people. Itzel Verduzco Rojas is from Ponca City, \nOklahoma. Itzel is working as a medical assistant for a pediatric dermatologist and in school full time trying to \npursue a career in nursing. In addition to her job and school, Itzel volunteers with CASA, City Rescue Mission, and \nRebuilding Together Oklahoma City to address issues of poverty and homelessness in her city. With DACA, Itzel \nwas able to apply for a driver's license and work legally. However, because her renewal application was caught up \nin postal delays, Itzel has not yet received her renewal, and her current DACA expired on January 20. Because of \nthis, she will now have to take a semester off from school, and she is facing severe disruption in her life and the \nability to support herself. This is really important to note because the people--some of the people in the White \nHouse have been saying nobody is being deported. Well, we will see about that. But they are saying these people \nare protected. They are not protected. And you heard the characterization that the President's Chief of Staff made \nabout some of these people, about being lazy or whatever it was. I think, in our discussions on the economy, in a \nseparate context, we have seen how few Americans would be able to rise to the occasion immediately if they had a \n$500 unsuspected bill that had come their way; whether the water heater broke or whatever it is, it would be \nchallenging, it would be disruptive to their lives. It would be hard for them to have an expendable, immediately \nexpendable, $500. But that is what it takes to sign up to what the President--the sign up that was required by the \nPresident after his September announcement. So it is not about being lazy. Or yes, it is probably about fear, too. \nMr. Kelly, General Kelly, mentions that. But it is about not understanding the situation of fear and of contribution, \nthe beautiful contribution that people make, that the DREAMers make to our country. Itzel came to the U.S. legally \nat age 7. She came legally and attempted to adjust her status along with family. She aged out of eligibility when she \nturned 21. She was able to apply for DACA during her senior year of high school, which opened the doors for her. \nIn Albuquerque, New Mexico, Dalia Medina immigrated to the United States at age 11 from Mexico. She is a \nlicensed mental health therapist providing much-needed service to at-risk youth and families in New Mexico. Dalia \nis working toward an independent license to open her private practice to continue aiding families in her State. She \nrecently obtained a master's degree in clinical social work and previously earned a bachelor's degree in criminology \nand psychology. All of these people are making such a wonderful contribution to our society because they have \ncourage, they have values, and they have purpose in their life. These stories were given to me by our colleagues as \nthey have taken up the cause of many of these DREAMers. But it is not enough. We have no right to talk about \nDREAMers and to tell their stories and take pride in their actions unless we are willing to take action to support \nthem, and we have that opportunity today by asking the Speaker of the House to give us a vote. What are you \nafraid of? Give us a vote. Let the House work its will. Senator McConnell, Mitch McConnell, is enabling the Senate \nto work its will. [[Page H915]] Why should the House of Representatives be constrained, especially on such a \nvalues-based issue as who we are as a nation and recognizing our biblical responsibility to each other? Nicole \nRobles from Houston, Texas, she was born in Mexico. Her family immigrated to the United States when she was 6 \nmonths old, and she faces deportation. In less than 100 days, her DACA will expire. I am anxious--Well, this is now \nmuch less than 100 days. She says: ``I'm anxious because I am graduating high school in a few months and I want \nto start college in August of next year. How will I do that without my DACA?'' She says: ``There are so many \nbarriers to higher education when you're undocumented. With a Dream Act, undocumented students will have a \nsense''--the Dream Act gives them a documented sense--``of security and opportunity''--to go to school--``to get a \njob, to care for their families, to continue their studies in college or university.'' ``I want that security and opportunity. \nWe deserve that.'' She deserves that. ``And we need Congress by the end of the year so that we, more people, \ndon't reach their expiration dates.'' Now, let me say that we have talked mostly about education, people working in \neducation and social activities to help other people do their best. But many of our DREAMers have served in our \nmilitary with great courage and great patriotism to the only country that they know. Again, using my leader's minute, \nI want to make sure that the Record is clear about what this debate is about. It is about honoring our own \ncommitment to the Statue of Liberty, to the Founding Fathers, in terms of making this a land where one generation \nwould take responsibility to make the future better for the next. And that brings to mind another person from \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, Yuridia Loera. She said: ``Growing up, I was reminded of my immigration status every \nday by my mother. Twenty years later, I realized she did this to prepare our family for the imminent day that our \nfamily would face a deportation. And that day could be today because my DACA has expired. ``DACA is what \n\n\n\nallowed me to pass through immigration checkpoints safely. I am also a survivor of sexual assault--with DACA, I \nwas able to approach the police to report the person who assaulted me. Trump's cruel decision to terminate DACA \nhas put border residents and survivors of assault in jeopardy. This is not how a country should treat immigrant \nyouth and our families.'' I just want you to know why we are making this plea. This is a human plea to the Speaker, \na prayerful human plea to the Speaker. It is almost 40 hours. This morning, when I first met with my colleagues in \nour meeting at 8, it was exactly 40 hours until midnight tomorrow. Forty is a number fraught with meaning in our \nreligious lives. Forty years, in the Old Testament, 40 years of Moses and the Jews and Aaron in the desert; 40 days \nthat Christ was in the desert himself; 40 days is the length of time of Lent; and, therefore, 40 hours is a Catholic \ndevotion that many of us grew up with. We have that same 40 hours, from 8 this morning until tomorrow night at \nmidnight, to be prayerful--to be prayerful--to show our purpose, and to show why we are asking the Speaker for this \nvote. I have great admiration for the work that is done in a bipartisan way, on the budget, the bill; of course, it is not \neverything we want, but there are many good things in it, and I just can't explain to the DREAMers or to my \ncolleagues why we should be second-class Members of Congress in this House without a commitment from the \nSpeaker that Mitch McConnell gave to the Senators, that there would be a vote on the floor to let Congress work its \nwill. {time} 1030 Are you afraid that the DREAMer bill will pass, the work of Mr. Hurd and Mr. Aguilar working with \nother Members to shape a bill that would recognize concerns that the President has and others have to put a \nbipartisan bill there that should attract the support of the President? Instead, we are hearing words that are hard to \nprocess from the White House but, nonetheless, recognizing that we have to go down this path together. We all \nbelieve that, as the Bible tells us, there is a spark of divinity in every person and that we must respect that spark of \ndivinity. Tomorrow will be the prayer breakfast, and that is a solemn occasion in Washington, D.C., and we are \nalways thinking in terms of Christ. When Christ became man, his assuming humanity brought his divinity to us so \nthat we participate in his divinity, every one of us. We have to remember that not only does it exist in every person \nthat we encounter, but it exists in us. It exists in the President of the United States and his staff and all of the people \nwho elected him. That is a beautiful thing about it all. But that spark of divinity in each of us has to relate to other \npeople and treat them with respect. How would we judge other countries if they said: ``We have several hundred \nthousand people who came here as children, and now we are sending them back where they came from?'' We \nwould make a judgment about those countries that that was outside the circle of civilized human behavior. And yet--\nand yet--we have something to do about that right now. I want to talk to you about Juan Carlos Navarro from \nOregon. He said: ``I immigrated to the United States when I was 3 years old with my parents because I needed \nmedical treatment for my cerebral palsy. I went through six surgeries and 12 years of physical therapy and walked \nfor the first time when I was 15 years old. ``Growing up, I did well in school, but I felt stuck because I didn't know \nhow to go to college. With the help of my counselor, I was able to apply for private scholarships and attend a \ncommunity college in Salem. I'm now at Western Oregon University, where I was inspired to start my own group for \nundocumented young people like me. I'm now getting my master's there, and I'm part of the college Student \nServices Administration Program, with the dream of one day making higher education accessible to low-income and \nundocumented students. ``Without DACA, I no longer have access to health insurance through an employer. I \nsuffer from depression and suicidal thoughts. This is why I have visited my Members of Congress to urge them to \npass the Dream Act, because my life and my health is on the line.'' Patricia Ulloa was born in El Salvador. Patricia \nsaid: ``I have a mixed status family--my parents have TPS, I have one U.S. citizen brother, and my two sisters and \nI have DACA. We need the Dream Act now because one of my sister's DACA expires on March 6, 2018, and pretty \nsoon the rest of my sisters and I could lose our protections too. Our parents are already losing their TPS \nprotections because Trump terminated the program. ``I want the government to recognize us as part of society and \nknow that this is our home and we contribute to our communities even without papers. My family wants to be able to \nstay together and feel safe to drive, work, and travel.'' Here she says--I want to repeat this--``we contribute to our \ncommunities even without papers.'' As an Italian American who grew up at a time when I did not feel any prejudice \nor bias--or if I did, I thought it was the other person's problem. We Italian Americans always think there are only two \nkinds of people: those who are Italian American and those who want to be. But in my father's generation and my \ngrandfather's generation and my great-grandmother's generation, it was a different story, and there was a term. It \nwas called ``wop,'' and people used that as a derogatory term to Italian Americans. Do you know what wop means, \nMr. Speaker? Wop means without papers. Without papers. That is what these people were called, without papers. \nAnd that is all that these kids are, without papers. In every other way, strong participants in our society, in our \ncommunity, and in our country. And so again, just give us a chance to have a vote, Mr. Speaker. Another day will \ncome when we can talk about comprehensive immigration reform. We [[Page H916]] can talk about this, that, and \n\n\n\nthe other thing, but right now, the Hurd-Aguilar bill, whatever is being put together in the Senate, recognizes our \nresponsibility to protect our borders, recognizes the value of immigration to our country: hopes, dreams, aspirations, \nmaking America more American every newcomer who comes. I truly believe that, the constant reinvigoration of \nAmerica. Saba Nefes from Texas was born in Mexico, and Saba writes: ``We still don't know a lot about cancer. We \nstill don't know about genetic diseases. My research at Texas Tech goes right into the heart of that. It uses pure \nmathematics to look at why all these genetic diseases exist and how they exist so someday we can come up with \ncures for them. We're far from that point, but this is the challenge I work on. ``In addition to conducting research at \nTexas Tech, I've taught undergraduate students as a teaching assistant. This past semester, I got to teach \nanatomy, and one of my students was blind and had a service dog. It was a blessing, a great experience to teach \nher anatomy, something that she got to touch and feel to learn. It taught me a lot of patience. It taught me what it's \nlike to work alongside my American students and peers. I'm just as much a part of their lives as they are of mine. \n``If DACA is repealed, I would be out of a job immediately, and I won't be able to teach my students. I won't be able \nto continue conducting the research that I am conducting right now. This research could help scientists understand \ndiseases like cancer and lead down a path toward a cure. Without DACA, I can't continue this critical work.'' Now, I \nwant to just say this. I think there is a lack of understanding, and we should have made it clear on the other side of \nthe aisle and with the White House about what the President's action in September did. The President, maybe in \ngood spirit, thought that by giving us a March 5 deadline, he was giving a 6-month reprieve to DREAMers; but what, \nin fact, he was doing was making matters worse for them. It was most unfortunate. Most unfortunate because, \nagain, while they may have maintained the status of DREAMer, they did not have the protections of the DACA \nexecutive order that President Obama put forth. Perhaps it would have been better if President Trump had said: ``I \nam giving Congress 6 months to pass a bill, but I am not changing the status quo that protects the DREAMers.'' \nJust on that point, President Obama, when he protected the DREAMers and their parents, what he did was \nsignificant, but it was not as significant as what President Reagan did in the 1980s. President Obama acted \nbecause Congress would not act. He took action. President Reagan acted after Congress did act, the Immigration \nAct of 1986. President Reagan said, interesting: But you did not go far enough. So he instituted, by executive order, \nFamily Fairness. And then Family Fairness was continued under President George Herbert Walker Bush, two great \nPresidents for immigration in our country. What they did with their executive orders, which stood the test of court \ncases, protected a higher percentage of people than what President Obama did--two Republican Presidents, two \ngreat champions on immigration. Even after Congress acted, they said: You didn't go far enough. President Obama \nhad to act because Congress would not act. Then we come forward with President Clinton following in that tradition. \nPresident George W. Bush, great President on immigration, he couldn't convince his own party to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform. But his statements, his values-based policy on immigrants is something, to \nthis day--and his current statements are so beautiful and inspirational about treating people with dignity and valuing \ntheir worth as we talk about immigration. And then, of course, President Obama, doing what he did in terms of \nexecutive orders, protecting people in the tradition of Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, with the \ncommon values of George W. Bush and President Clinton. So now we have the first Republican President in \nmodern times--the first President, really--who is anti-immigrant, and that is just such a change from his own party, \nand it makes it hard to see where we can have shared values. Certainly one piece of that debate which would \nrequire a fuller stipulation of fact, hearings, et cetera, to see what the best path forward is is important for us to do. \nBut for now, because of the action that the President took, it necessitates us taking action here, as the President \nanticipated by putting a March 5 deadline on it. We would like to do it sooner. This is a vehicle leaving the station. \nAnd if the Republicans need our support for this legislation, which has many good features--and I commend the \nnegotiators on it and was a part of that--unless we can get the same commitment that Mitch McConnell gave the \nbipartisan group of legislators who asked for it in the Senate, we would like that same response to our bipartisan \ngroup. I want to talk about Jaime Rangel: ``To me, Georgia is my home. I am proud to be from the South, and I love \nto give back to my community. ``I tell everybody I'm a Latino that grew up eating tortillas and grits at the same time, \nand north Georgia is home. And for somebody to say, `Hey, you can't get some instate tuition' in a place that I \nconsider my State was really--it was really heartbreaking. I felt out of place. ``Right now, I feel optimistic because I \nbelieve the greater part of the country understands that you can't deport 750,000 individuals. These are individuals \nwho give back to their community, who are involved in their churches, who have Ph.D.'s, who have been creating \njobs and who just want to make this country a better place. ``When President Obama announced DACA, to me, it \nwas a life-changing experience. I felt that I finally was given a decent chance to be somebody in this country, to \ncontribute to my State, to contribute to my community, to get a job, and just give back and be somebody in the \n\n\n\ngreatest country on Earth.'' That is the patriotism of our DREAMers. ``So when DACA was introduced, it opened the \ndoors to many things, even doors I didn't think were imaginable to open. ``My name is Jaime Rangel. I was born in \nMexico, but I came to this country when I was only 3 months old.'' As the President said, he loves the DREAMers. \nHe loves the DREAMers. He loves to call it DACA. Subscribe to that. He loves the DREAMers. And these people \ncame to this country not of their own volition, through no fault of their own. I, myself, thank their parents for \nbringing them here because they are a blessing to America, but, from their standpoint, through no fault of their \nown. Why can't we be fair and give them a break? Javier Noris in New York City came from Mexico: ``I invest in the \nnext generation of biomedical tech solutions. ``When I was working at a convenience store, I always had big \naspirations, even though I wasn't sure how they would come to fruition. But the moment DACA was passed, it really \nput everything in perspective, and I really made a conscious effort to focus on my career. So I ended up pursuing a \ncareer as a software engineer. ``I went to school at Cal State University, Northridge. I studied economics and \nbiotechnology. After working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, I ended up moving to Brooklyn, New York. I \nnow work in venture capital, running a small venture fund that invests in early- stage life science and frontier \ntechnology startups. ``As a CEO of an investment fund, DACA being repealed does not only affect me. A DACA \nrepeal could affect the startups with which I work and my ability to invest in them and their ability to continue to grow \nand employ hundreds of workers across the country. ``My name is Javier. I'm a DACA recipient and I'm from \nMexico City. I came to the United States when I was 5 years old.'' He did not come alone. He did not. He was \nbrought here by his parents. So many of our DREAMers here are called DREAMers because they have big \ndreams. And they are entrepreneurs; they are teachers; they are [[Page H917]] researchers in science; they are in \nour military. They are making such a fabulous contribution to the future of our country. It is not just about them. This \nDACA repeal that we are making is about us: Who are we as a country? How do we honor the vows of our \nfounders, the Statue of Liberty and her appeal to the world that has made America such a beacon of hope? {time} \n1045 The list goes on and on about many, many DACA recipients, and I intend to read them all. But in addition to \nthat, I want to go back to the Bible because I could have brought the Bible here and just read the Bible and said: If \nwe are people of faith, in God we trust, as we contend to be, we must act upon our faith, and act upon our values. \nPeople always ask me: Where is hope? Where should we find hope? Hope is sitting there where it always has \nbeen, right between faith and charity. People have hope because they believe. They believe in God. They have \nfaith in our country and themselves and their families; and they have faith in the goodness, the charity of others that \npeople, when given the chance, will do the right thing, and then, hopefully, that will be returned to them when they \nneed hope and can have faith in the goodness of others. I want to tell you about Maria Praeli. She is from \nConnecticut. She said: ``I didn't let anything keep me from advancing academically. Unfortunately, when high \nschool ended, I couldn't attend the university of my dreams. I was getting all these acceptance letters, but I couldn't \ngo to any of these schools because I didn't have a Social Security number''--this is my point; you can't get a Social \nSecurity number--``and, therefore, I wasn't eligible for financial aid. I couldn't pursue the dreams that I had been \nhoping to. But I did not let my undocumented status hold me back from continuing to advance academically. ``I \nenrolled at Gateway Community College, where I worked very hard as a student government association president \nand graduated with 3.8 GPA to then be able to attend Quinnipiac University. I graduated magna cum laude and \nearned my bachelor's degree in May of 2016. ``It's surreal to wake up every day and be reminded that even though \nI have been living in America for the past 18 years, in a few months, all my honors and education might end up not \nmattering anymore because I won't be able to contribute to the country which I have called home for so long. ``My \nname is Maria. I was born in Ica, Peru, and moved to the United States when I was 5 years old.'' There is \ndocumentation after documentation of how young these children were when they came to the United States all \nbecause their parents wanted to make the future better for them. Andrea Seabra writes: ``My dad was a fighter \npilot in the Peruvian Air Force, so I grew up with a lot of military influence. When I was in high school, I joined New \nJersey ROTC, which was the junior ROTC, and I was there for 3\\1/2\\ years. ``It gave me that taste of maybe what \nmy dad might have lived when he was in the military. I lost him when I was only 6 years old, so I never really got to \nknow that part of him. I always thought in the back of my head, when I graduate, I want to join the military. When I \nwas in my junior year, I realized that I couldn't enroll in the military because I was undocumented. ``I was sitting \nwith a recruiter at my school, an Air Force recruiter, and he asked me about it. He's like, `What's your social?' So \nwhen I told him, `Well, I don't have one--' '' meaning Social Security number--``he is like, `What about your \npassport?' I'm like, `Well, I have a Peruvian passport.' And he's like, `No, you have to either be a U.S. resident or a \nU.S. citizen to be able to join.' ``That's the first time I ever experienced that big wall of being undocumented, like a \nbig stop sign saying, no, you can't pursue this passion of yours. ``I didn't live a normal life until I got DACA. Thanks \n\n\n\nto DACA, I was able to pursue my career after graduating cum laude from Saint Leo University, in marketing. With \nDACA, I was able to build my professional network, help people, influence people, and do all these things for myself \nand my family and my community. If that's going to be taken away, everything that I've accomplished, that I've \nworked on, that I've helped people with will just fall apart. It will shake the foundation of who I am today as a person, \nas a professional, even as a friend, as a daughter, everything. ``My name is Andrea. I was born in Lima, Peru. I was \nbrought here by my mom when I was 11 years old.'' She had lost her dad when she was 6. But this idea of military \nservice, many, when they got the DACA status protection, have served honorably in the military. We are very proud \nof them, as we are proud of all of our men and women in the military. And I emphasize the story of hard work that \nthese DREAMers have because they are very consistent with American workers. American people are so \nresourceful. They are so wonderful. They so care about their families and their communities. So this is not to say \nthat DACA recipients are different. It is to say they are just like us. We are very proud of the American people, the \nproductivity of our workforce, the faith of our families, the civic mindedness and the generosity of spirit, and, really, \nof resources of the American people. My telling these stories is not to separate the DACA recipients from them, but \nto show how similar they are and how assimilated they are into our community. It is mutually beneficial. Jose \nManuel Santoyo, from Texas, said: ``My education was so that I could contribute to society. ``My last year at \nSouthern Methodist University, I began working on an engaged learning fellowship. Because of that, I was selected \nto be the commencement speaker for my graduation and represent almost 600 other students who would be \ngraduating that day. In my speech, I thanked the faculty and staff at my university. I had teachers who I've looked \nup to my whole life, who provided amazing educational opportunities regardless of the papers I had or didn't have. \n``I want to be able to work and I want to work in public service. In order to do that, I would need to have DACA. I \nwould need to have work authorization in this country. I feel like that's what my education was for. My education \nwasn't for me. My education was so I could contribute to society. My education was so that I could give back to the \ncommunity that has given me so much, to the country that has given me so much. ``This year I hope that our \nCongress and our President work to fund a permanent solution to provide us DACA recipients a pathway to \ncitizenship, to give us an opportunity to use our education, to use everything that we've learned in order to give \nback, in order to contribute, in order to provide for ourselves and our families and our communities.'' What Manuel \nsaid is that he looked up to his teachers. He learned from others in our country. That also demonstrates the \nbeautiful commitment of the American people to teach, to shed light to younger people, newcomers to our country, \nto make a valuable contribution. So in saluting, as I say, the DREAMers, we are saluting the opportunity they were \ngiven by the American people to make their contribution. Hopefully, Congress will live up to the values of the \nAmerican people who overwhelmingly support the DREAMers, and see this as a separate issue not just about the \nDREAMers, but about who we are as a country. Cesar Vargas was born in Mexico. He holds a law degree and \nwants to became a military lawyer. Aside from advocating for legislation to allow DREAMers to serve in the military, \nhe has been advocating for immigration reform through a political group he launched last year called Dream Action \nCoalition. The group is known for challenging lawmakers on their stance on immigration and highlighting the \npolitical power of voters. In his case, Latino voters. Kelly--just Kelly--is from Dover, New Jersey. Kelly is a student \nworking toward becoming a medical assistant. She will be done with courses in January. However, without a DACA \nwork permit, she won't be able to complete an internship required to complete her training and get certified. Her \ndriver's license also expires in February. [[Page H918]] Understand this: you can't have a Social Security card, a \npassport, a driver's license. You cannot function as a person in our society without having your status protected by \nthe Dream Act. So when people tell you it is all protected, it isn't. Listen to the stories. So I was talking about Kelly. \nKelly is a student working to becoming a medical assistant. She will be done in January. However, without DACA, \nshe won't be able to complete her training or get her driver's license, as I mentioned. Kelly--just Kelly--has lived in \nNew Jersey since she was 5 years old. She says DACA has ``given me the chance to drive, have a work permit, \nbuy a car, get car insurance--things that obviously benefit the country as well. It's helped me to not be stuck, not to \nhave to depend on others. . . .'' Kelly's DACA renewal application was rejected because she forgot to fill in a date of \nexpiration. When she received notice of the error, she fixed it and sent the application back immediately, but, by \nthen, the arbitrary October deadline had passed. This is another reason why we need to clear this up. Crystal--just \nCrystal--is a single, working mom of 5 U.S. citizen children. She was born in the Bahamas and arrived in the U.S. at \n6 years old. Crystal had her fifth child only 3 weeks ago, and while recovering, she had been on unpaid leave from \na retail job, where she has worked for nearly 6 years. Now that her work authorization has expired, she will not be \nable to return to work, and her ability to provide for her kids will be impeded. What? Carlos from the Bronx. Carlos \nlives in the Bronx and is the only undocumented member of his family. The whole family pulls together to care for \n\n\n\nCarlos' younger sister who has severe cerebral palsy and cannot walk. Carlos' employer, a fabrication company, \ndesperately wants to keep Carlos as an employee. His DACA and work authorization expired February 18, 2017. It \nexpired already. So the list goes on and on. Carlos sent his DACA renewal application on September 18, 2017, 2 \nweeks after the President's announcement. But it was not received until December 11--he sent it on September 18. \nIt was received on October 11. In the rejection letter, he was notified that he failed to fill in his DACA expiration date \non one of the forms. The relevant information was included in the cover letter and in other parts of the packet. \nCarlos arrived in the U.S. when he was 2 years old. New York is the only place he can call home. The expiration \ndate was in the package, but in one of the forms it was not added. So he lost his protections. I have to mention \nKelly, who is a constituent of Rodney Frelinghuysen. Crystal, who was here from the Bahamas, is a constituent of \nTed Deutch. Carlos is from the Bronx and is a constituent of Joe Crowley. Saul is from San Francisco and is a \nconstituent of Jackie Speier. Saul aspires to be a teacher, Mr. Speaker. DACA has allowed him to work in the field \nhe is passionate about: education. He was able to get a driver's license. Saul submitted a DACA renewal \napplication September 30, well in time, via USPS express delivery. He received notification of an error, which he \nfixed and resubmitted. However, his application was rejected as untimely. Agustin is from Brooklyn. Agustin's DACA \nwill expire in January-- already--within days of his 21st birthday. DACA allowed Agustin to go to college to study \ncriminal justice. He works and goes to school. When his DACA expires--which it has--he won't have the means to \npay his bills and the cost of school. What are we doing? It is like without papers, WOP. And now people who are \nstriving to have their papers are outlawed on a technicality. Really? Aren't we supposed to be enabling people to \nmake their contribution instead of hurting them with the process? It is, again, important to note, and for our viewers \nto note that what people are asking for is nothing special. It is asking them to honor what was there. When DACA \nrecipients were told to sign up, they submitted considerable information about their lives. They effectively outed \ntheir parents with the commitment that there would be protection for them. We have heard many good bipartisan \nproposals to protect the DREAMers, to give consideration to parents so that they would not be deported because \nthey brought a child into the country. Some of these parents have citizen children now who are also making a \ncontribution to our society. So it is because people understand that that September 5 announcement by the \nPresident was very disruptive. Let's hope that it was not intentional. I don't think that it was. I have no reason to \nthink that it was. But it did cause problems that perhaps were unforeseen. The system did not even allow for a \ncorrection in a form in a timely fashion because of dependence on when it was received to be judged a protection \nfor those students. So, in fact, over 110 DREAMers a day lose their protection. It is over--approaching 20,000 \nalready who are losing their protections. And it will be more by the time of March 5, which is the deadline. And if we \nare going to reach a March 5 deadline, or any deadline, we have to get on a timetable to do so. One timetable we \nhave is the opportunity today to have a commitment from the Speaker not to be afraid of DREAMers. Thank God for \nthem. They contribute. We are a nation of DREAMers. That is why they fit so comfortably in our society and \ncontribute to it so beautifully. {time} 1100 I will tell you about Mayron, Rick Larsen's constituent from Washington \nState. Mayron, originally from Honduras, has lived in the U.S. since he was 11 years old and knows no other \ncountry as home. He has overcome lots of obstacles to be who he is today, a successful entrepreneur who owns \nthree businesses. He submitted his DACA renewal application before the deadline. It arrived on October 2, 2017. \nHe accidentally submitted the processing fee for $465 instead of $495. That is what it takes. $495 is a lot of money. \nHis entire case was sent back for that reason. With his rejection, he received a green document stating: You are \ninvited to resubmit your application package after you have corrected the reasons for rejection. Place this letter on \ntop of your application package. Mayron affixed the processing fee and resubmitted his application with the green \ndocument on top of his application package. On October 31, he received the entire package in the mail with a \nrejection notice dated October 24 that stated that USCIS is no longer accepting DACA applications. Mayron has \nbeen a DACA applicant for the last 3 years and is heartbroken by the DHS' actions in rejecting the renewal of his \nDACA. Gregory Meeks' constituent, Brittany, writes that she was born in Trinidad and Tobago and arrived in the \nU.S. at 3 years old and grew up in New York. She has no close family in Trinidad and Tobago, and all of her \nimmediate and most of her extended family who are citizens and residents live near her in New York. Brittany is a \nfull-time caretaker for a family in Brooklyn with two 14-month-old sons, one of whom has special needs and requires \nphysical therapy. Although the child's special needs were not known when she was hired, Brittany has risen to the \noccasion with grace, calm, and competence according to the family. We are devastated by the thought she may not \nbe able to continue to work in this country, and, no, we won't find another caregiver who is as reliable, nurturing, \nand unshakeable as Brittany. Brittany submitted her renewal application September 21, but it was sent back to her \non October 5 because she forgot to sign her name in one place. She sent it back immediately but was rejected as \n\n\n\nuntimely. Hugo in Houston, Texas. Hugo is a 34-year-old father who lives in Houston, Texas. He came to the United \nStates from Mexico when he was 6 years old and has lived in Houston ever since. He completed K-12 in Houston \nand now works at a photo framing shop near downtown. After Trump was elected, Hugo worried about reapplying, \nso he waited. Hugo found out from one text message from a friend on September 6 that he needed to reapply \nbefore October 5 or risk losing his DACA. He decided to quickly put together his application as his DACA was set to \nexpire September 9, 2017. Hurricane Harvey had just hit the Houston area. While Hugo's home was [[Page H919]] \nnot destroyed, the entire city of Houston was shut down, including many businesses. Hugo's work was one of them. \nHe didn't have the time or money to pay an attorney. He had to borrow half the money for the application fee \nbecause he couldn't get $495 together in such a short period of time. Hugo was unable to get his DACA renewal \napplication mailed until October 4, which is still before the deadline. USCIS received Hugo's application on October \n6. On November 1, Hugo received a letter from USCIS denying his renewal. Now, you know if they got his \napplication on October 6, they knew it was mailed before October 5, or in time on October 5, but they turned him \ndown. The point I want to make here is these are technicalities that people have been turned down on. Could we all \nlive up to the standard that has been set to sign in every place with the date and the this and the that even though \nthe information is contained in the package, even though hurricanes intervened in the mail service or the \nopportunity to put the package together, no mitigation, no consideration for that? That is really unfortunate because \nthe American people are the losers in all of that. Fernanda writes that she arrived in the U.S. at age 2 wearing a \npink parka and matching pants, clutching on to her mom. She carried a single bag and abandoned her family in \nsearch of a better life beside her father in the U.S. Her dad was already in Alabama, and they were wanting to be by \nhis side. In the year before his decision to leave Mexico, he had been assaulted five times and already had his \nwedding band stolen twice. Since arriving to the States, they have been able to start four businesses and create \njobs. They purchased two cars and put Fernanda through college. They also have helped their U.S.-born son \nreach his goals of being a professional soccer player and is on the Olympic Development Program team for the \nsoutheast region. Sheila Jackson Lee is with us in the Chamber. Sheila's story is that one of these young people \nliving with uncertainty is Cesar Espinoza, a DREAMer from Houston who came to America from Mexico at the age \nof 6. Cesar adapted quickly to his Texas home and became a standout student excelling in programs for the gifted \nand talented throughout his primary and secondary education. Faced daily with the constant threat of deportation, \nCesar and his family were forced to have an emergency plan in place in the event one of his family members were \ndetained by the immigration services. Espinoza graduated from DeBakey High School near the top of his class and \nwas accepted at some of America's most prestigious universities, including Yale. But his undocumented status \nprevented him from obtaining financial assistance, nearly shattering his college ambitions. He could have given up \non his pursuit of a degree, but instead he chose to make a difference. I know there are other young people who are \njust like me, said Cesar. They need someone to fight for them and try to make a way. That is when he founded \nFIEL, an immigrants' rights organization based in Houston. Congresswoman Barbara Lee writes about her \nconstituent, Emily. Emily is a resident of Alameda, California. She came to the U.S. when she was 9 years old with \nher family from South Korea in the year 2000. She currently works in community health work in a federally qualified \nhealth center in Oakland, California, serving the underserved API community. Emily graduated from UC Berkeley in \n2014 and has been working as a community health worker ever since. She is also taking a class after work to \nprepare to apply to graduate school. Emily says DACA has changed her life and the lives of her family members. \nShe was able to finally contribute to her family's living expenses upon graduation and will continue to pursue her \ndreams. Emily is grateful for the protection she received under DACA. But she is also deeply concerned about her \nmother and friends who don't have the same opportunity to come out of the shadows. Emily said, ``When my rights \nas a `deserving American' are justified by the idea that it was `no fault of my own,' it automatically criminalizes my \nmother, whose love, sacrifice, and resilience made it possible for me and my siblings to be where we are today. I \nam forever thankful for her courage and the sacrifice she made to give us a better life.'' Emily's story is a reminder \nthat we must protect DREAMers, but we must never give up the fight for comprehensive immigration reform. It is \npast time for Congress to pass the clean Dream Act. Jose Castillo wrote: ``My name is Jose Castillo, and I am 22 \nyears old. When I was 4 years old''--can you imagine how precious--``my parents took my little sister and me and \npacked up everything they owned. We got on a plane and headed to the United States to escape a country in its \nearly stages of turmoil. My parents gave up everything they had to provide us with a sliver of a chance, one they \nknew we wouldn't have in Venezuela. ``They made it a point to raise us well while shielding us from racism and \ntheir fears of deportation. ``Eventually, we came to understand just how many doors were closed to us. \nDisheartened and frightened for our future, we prayed for something, anything. DACA was that something. DACA \n\n\n\nhas given me hope and a real chance, but, more importantly, it has given me a voice. I can proudly tell my story to \nanyone who is willing to listen, a story about a family who is determined and persistent in their pursuit of an \nAmerican life. ``DACA's removal would rip that away from us. Ending DACA will hurt more than 800,000 people, \npeople not just with dreams and aspirations, but people that want to be seen, understood, and welcomed. They are \nyour friends and your neighbors, your schoolteachers. . . .'' Now, this is so important: ``They are your friends and \nyour neighbors, your schoolteachers and your doctors, and they need you to come to their side and help. Call \nCongress, have an open conversation, relay facts and fight for my family and the hundreds of thousands like us.'' \nThis goes on and on. It just seems like it is such an easy solution. There are plenty of challenges that we have that \nare complex, comprehensive immigration reform, issues that relate to how we prepare our country for jobs for the \n21st century, how we prepare our workers and our education system and the rest. But in all of that, we have to be \nstrong as a country. To be strong as a country, we have to be true to our values. To be true to our values is to \nrespect the aspirations of people who are our future. Our young people are our future, and these DREAMers are \npart of that. They have enriched our community, and they have been enriched by our community, by the goodness \nof the American people, and by the greatness of our country. So our plea to the Speaker is not one just for the \nDREAMers. Our plea to the Speaker is for us, for ourselves, again, to honor the vows of our Founders, our \npatriarch, George Washington, and others who followed him to make our country great, but also to make it a \nbeacon of hope to the rest of the world. Claudia came to the United States when she was 5. She said: `` . . . my \nfamily brought me to a country I would call home. I had to learn a new language, new culture, a new way of life. I \nwas brought here by hardworking, loving parents who only wanted what was best for my future, running away from \npoverty and leaving family behind in the hope of a better life. ``DACA allowed me to have a chance at a better \ntomorrow. I am now a medical assistant and a third-year student at the University of Utah. Taking away DACA \nwould remove the privileges that I hold dearly. I am not an `illegal alien,' nor am I a criminal or a rapist. I am a \nhuman; I am 1 of the 800,000 DREAMers who thrive for a better future. America is my home. I didn't choose to be \nundocumented, but I do decide to keep fighting for what is right and keep moving forward, undocumented and \nunafraid. I am a DREAMer, and I am here to stay.'' Did I tell you about Juan Escalante? ``With much foresight to the \noncoming political evidence, my parents fled Venezuela in 2000, with my two brothers and me in tow, for the \nUnited States. In 2006, we learned that an immigration attorney had mishandled our immigration case, which meant \nthat, [[Page H920]] after 6 years of legal fees and paying taxes, we were no longer on the path towards U.S. \ncitizenship. ``By the time President Obama announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program \nin 2012, I had graduated from Florida State University with a political science degree. I fought and lost two \nlegislative fights in support of the Dream Act, helped enact a law in Florida that would provide in-state tuition for \nundocumented students across the State, and helped organize thousands of DREAMers from all across the \ncountry. ``Since 2013, DACA has protected my brothers and me from deportation. With DACA, I was able to return \nto FSU for a master's degree in public administration and get a job in immigration advocacy, as the digital \ncampaigns manager for America's Voice. I am a Tallahassee resident.'' Mayra came to the United States at age 6. \nShe said: ``I have now lived in the United States for 21 years. Currently, I work full time as a special education \nparaprofessional. I am also a college student. I'm working on my third college degree.'' How many of us can make \nthat claim? ``In May of 2018, I will be graduating summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in elementary \neducation and special education. A challenge I have had to overcome is accepting situations that are out of my \ncontrol and knowing that having strength and fortitude will lead me to prevail in the end. ``I first went to college to \nbecome a nurse. In 2011, my junior year of college, I graduated with honors with an associate's degree in nursing. \nUnfortunately, I was unable to get licensed due to my immigration status. It was upsetting and embarrassing. I was \nembarrassed because I would see former peers working as actual nurses, and I wasn't. And not because I was \nincapable, but merely because I was never even given the opportunity to take the NCLEX and get licensed. ``In \n2012, I finished my senior year in college and graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in general studies. \nOver the years, the State I reside in has changed State legislation to allow DACA recipients to receive driver's \nlicenses, professional licenses, and certifications.'' That is a beautiful thing, but we want that for the whole country. \nThere are just certain things, the contributions of DREAMers to our society, the work they do every day with the \nAmerican people of which they consider themselves to be a part, the benefits they have received from working and \nknowing people in our country, themselves benefiting from the greatness of the American people, the reciprocity \nthey have given back and honoring the American Dream, working hard with a work ethic, an ethic of faith, family, \nand community, and a work ethic, usually typical of an immigration community as many of us who are families from \nthe immigration community, which are all of us unless we happen to be very blessed to be born a Native American \n\n\n\nin our country. How beautiful some of the Native American families in our country have been to our newcomers to \nour country. Our country should all be that welcoming, and I think our country is. That is why the numbers are in the \neighties and nineties, in terms of support for DREAMers, and even in the seventies among Republicans for a path \nto citizenship. Carlos Emilio Diaz writes: ``I am 19 years old, and I was born in Guerrero, Mexico. I moved to \nHouston when I was a year old''--a year old--``and was raised there my entire life. I am currently a student at UT \nAustin. My biggest dream is to provide my parents with everything they need without them having to work. They \nhave sacrificed so much and continue to do so. I feel that's the least I could do. DACA gives me that opportunity, \nand without it, my dream has become uncertain.'' One of the things that I think many families in transition, that is to \nsay, the upward mobility of education in our country and the length of time that families have been here, is the story \nof their respect for their parents, to see opportunities that they have, that DREAMers in this case have, but just take \nany people in our country. That one generation has tremendous opportunity because of the sacrifice of their \nparents and grandparents. {time} 1115 One of the attitudes that I have heard from people is, while they are \nenjoying and are grateful for everything that they have and the opportunity they have to give back to society, they \nhave a certain sadness that their parents didn't have that same opportunity for education, to reach their personal \naspirations. Their aspiration was to make the future better for their children. They certainly were successful at that. \nBut, still, among some young people, you hear: ``I wish my parents could have had this opportunity.'' How many \npeople have ever said: ``If only my mother would have had this opportunity''? That is in every generation, \npractically, because opportunities for women have changed so much. But, in any case, I have a neighbor in East \nPalo Alto in the heart of Silicon Valley, Rocio, who writes: ``I grew up in East Palo Alto in the heart of Silicon Valley \nbefore and after the dot-com bubble. Despite living in a tough neighborhood of violence''--you maybe don't know \nthat, but East Palo Alto is, in the heart of all this wealth, success, and entrepreneurship, a place that needs more of \nour attention. ``Despite living in a tough neighborhood of violence, I watched ``Star Trek Voyager,'' ``Friends,'' read \nDr. Seuss, and memorized musicals from ``Funny Girl'' to ``The Wizard of Oz.'' On the weekends, I helped my dad \nclean office buildings. He hid me in the trash cart to sneak me into work. I picked up the trash and refilled the trash \ncan with bags at every room. Today, I am in one of those conference rooms whiteboarding with engineers and \nproduct managers to solve the toughest problems in Big Data.'' Imagine being sneaked in in a trash barrel, helping \nto clean those offices, and now being the leader in the room, whiteboarding with engineers and product managers, \nsolving the toughest problems in Big Data. ``Anyone who thinks East Palo Alto is a precious community doesn't live \nthere anymore. During the worst days of gang violence, I had to become street smart and know that, as an \nimmigrant and only child in a house of 17 people, I wasn't in a position to fight back. My strategy was always to \nkeep a low profile and be on the lookout for trouble. ``The community of EPA put me in touch with amazing people \nthrough Eastside. Eastside is a private''--when I say ``EPA,'' in this case, it is East Palo Alto. ``The community of \nEast Palo Alto put me in touch with amazing people through Eastside. Eastside is a private school in EPA that \nhelps underrepresented and first-generation students get into college. A couple sponsored me from 6th through \n12th grade. ``Every day, I met volunteers and teachers from the surrounding towns and Stanford University. \nThrough a reading program, I met Christina, or Chris, as I like to call her, who, for the past 15 years has been a \nmentor and a friend. She helped me become a better reader and eventually edit a manuscript for a book. The \neducation and support that I received at Eastside allowed me to be successful and stay safe. ``It sounds crazy, but I \ncouldn't get a cell phone. If something happened to me while my parents worked the night shift as janitors, I \ncouldn't call 911. I didn't have a credit history, which requires a Social Security number. That's when I started \nbecoming aware of my status as an undocumented student. A Stanford med school student, Julie, helped me out. \nAlthough the phone was under her name, I paid her in cash for part of my bill every month.'' So, again, you see, \nwithout it--no status, no credit, no Social Security number, no driver's license--it is debilitating and doubly worrisome \nbecause so many of these people are making such a valuable contribution to our society, learning from the \nAmerican people, and giving back. Maneri: ``I'm 18 years old and from Los Angeles. I just graduated high school \nand will be attending UCLA to study political science in the fall. Being an undocumented student has been tough. \nComing to this country at 6 years old completely changed my life. Learning English and doing well in school was a \nbattle since everyone in my family only spoke Spanish and had [[Page H921]] no more than an elementary school \neducation. ``However, being a DREAMer has also shaped who I am, what I stand for, and has inspired me to dream \nbig. After graduation, I hope to go to law school and become an immigration lawyer to help others in my situation \nand give back to my community. I dream that one day your immigration status doesn't define your path in life or \nhold you back from reaching your goals but, instead, encourages and embraces diversity.'' Again, so many stories \nof so many DREAMers. I just want to see if we have some more from our colleagues in terms of the ones that they \n\n\n\nhave submitted. We have received all of these from our colleagues. Some of them identified as being from them or \nnot, but all of them, again, proud, proud of these young people who not only are DREAMers, but inspire the rest of \nus to dream. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your courtesy. I am not finished yet. I thank you for your courtesy in the \ninterim and just want to say I am taking this time because I think we have an opportunity now that is almost \nmatchless. We are at a moment when we can all come together to do something really good for the country, take \nan action that has bipartisan support. We have no right, as I said earlier, any of us, to associate ourselves with the \naspirations of the DREAMers unless we are able to and willing and courageous enough to take action on their \nbehalf. So, while some of us have been, more or less, receptive to receiving DREAMers, learning from them, being \ninspired by them, some have not been as exposed to these DREAMers and their stories as others. I think, if you \nhad been--and I am not saying you reject it; I am just saying maybe it is geography or whatever--you would be as \ninsistent as many of us are that we live up to who we are as a country, and this people's House listens to the voices \nof the American people who overwhelmingly support our DREAMers. Again, I don't know when we would have \nanother opportunity that matches today for us to just get a simple commitment from the Speaker of the House that \nhe will give us a vote. There is no guarantee. We will have the debate. People will weigh in. They will make their \nvoices heard. Congress, again, will work its will. But do not diminish this House of Representatives, this people's \nHouse, to a place where we don't have the right to express our views on a subject so important to our country that \nhas such general support in the public and, yet, the Speaker of the House is saying we don't matter here, we, \nMembers of the House, don't count in this consideration because maybe we just don't have the courage to do what \nwe need to do. I believe we do. I believe many people on the Republican side of the aisle have demonstrated even \ngreater courage than some of us on this side. It is easy for me. But it is also hard for me because we really, again, \nare in a position to do something, and we feel helpless--that is what the hard part is--helpless if our Speaker will not, \nSpeaker of the whole House, give this dignity to this House of Representatives to be able to take the vote on a \nsubject of broad debate in the country, but we can't debate a bill on the floor of the House. The Senate has received \nthat dignity, has received that commitment from Mitch McConnell, from Leader McConnell on the Republican side, \nbut, nonetheless, the Senate side, responding to bipartisan support, bringing a bill to the floor with, again, no \nguarantee, the debate, we will see what path that legislation takes. But why a gag rule in the House of \nRepresentatives? Why a gag rule? And that is why I am voicing some of the concerns today, largely through the \nvoices and the stories of our DREAMers. We want to be sure that the public record of the Congress of the United \nStates forevermore will reflect the stories of their great contribution to America in the hopes that those stories will \nmove the Speaker of the House to give us a vote, to elevate this House of Representatives to its rightful place \ninstead of diminishing us by saying the Senate may talk about these subjects that the American people care so \nmuch about, not so fast in the House of Representatives. So that is why I am using my leadership minute to make \nsure that the Record will show the magnificent contributions of the DREAMers in our country, the courage it took for \ntheir parents to bring them here. And again, Members are sending in their stories from Dallas, Texas, from Arizona \nState. Let me read this one: Pitter-patter. Pitter-patter. Stretching out my hand to greet her. She reiterated my \nname, Mr. Luis Roberto Usera, class salutatorian. Isn't that great? Making the salutary address. Clear as the day, \nbreaking wind upon my face, silencing my voice as I spoke out in a crowd of thousands. This is our day, ladies and \ngentlemen, the class of 2012. The last 18 years of our lives, everything we have accomplished, everything we have \nbeen through has led us to today. Reading these words aloud encouraged that I had made a difference, that my \nwork ethic finally paid off. This is meant to be an honor. Here I was, 4.8 grade point average, 4.8 grade point \naverage, all honors classes. Ran student government and some of the most successful blood drives my school \never has seen and no way to do anything with it. I looked, watching people's reaction, their faces toward mine, \nwaiting for me to continue. And so I did. An echo was heard around the amphitheater rapidly dispersing my voice to \neveryone in the back, to myself. I spoke into the enchanted crowd, amused at my priestlike voice. And here, 4 years \nlater, we have to face that same feeling, the bittersweet combination of nostalgia and excitement that comes when \nyou turn off one road in your life and onto another. The speech would have been great if I had believed a word I \nwas saying. The speech might have rung true to someone else, but the advice that was inadvertently coming out of \nmy mouth meant nothing to myself. I could no longer follow my own advice. Governing laws did not allow \nundocumented immigrants to go to college right out of high school. My too thin of a boy who ignorantly thought \nhe would go to college transformed to that of a cashier tending lines in the local supermarket. In retrospect, those \nfeelings were before DACA was announced. I still remember the many chills that went through my body when \nPresident Obama announced the initiative. Then, still worried that it might be too good to be true, I stuck with it and \napplied, making a huge difference in my life. I could continue my education, work legally, and live peacefully in a \n\n\n\nworld surrounded by fear. Through DACA, I could achieve the by then impossible college education. DACA \nallowed me to come out of the shadows and show the true potential I have without fear. DACA demonstrated to me \nthat people cared, that people wanted to help and understand the situation. I recently received TheDream.US \nscholarship that bestowed upon me the gift of education, for which I will be ever grateful. I am currently an \nundergraduate student studying biochemistry at Arizona State University. A great school, by the way. I arrived in \nthe United States when I was 5. I grew up American. I grew up speaking English. I grew up to call the United States \nhome. This is my home. This is my country. I am here to stay. Luis Roberto Usera Brisano. Sofia de la Varga, an \nEMT student: I was 5 years old when my mother told me where we were going to on vacation. At the time, I was \nexcited for this vacation because our dog had passed away and was buried right outside my bedroom window. I \nwasn't too happy about that when it came to getting a night's rest. I went ahead and I gathered my teddy bear and \nbook bag, which pretty much summed up all my belongings as a child. When I was 15, I realized our vacation was \nmore than a permanent move from a dangerous country. My mother gave up her entire family for us. She left her \nbrothers and her mother to risk her life for us. Today, I feel worthless. Since I came to America, I have felt nothing \nbut useless and not belonging. I grew up here. I work, study, breathe, and want to live forever here. Yet never in my \nlife have I been given a chance to become a citizen, because I was not born here. For the longest, I have been sick \nand tired of living in a place that I am not wanted. For so long, this place I call home refuses to call me theirs. When \npeople ask me where I am from, I say ``America.'' America. My soul and heart are from here. If I were to move \nback, I know for a fact I would not like it. I wouldn't have a car, internet, friends, security. And getting killed is a \npossibility every day. However, if the choice were mine and no one in my family existed, I would leave in a \nheartbeat because at least I would belong. I wanted to leave many times. My mom, the most wonderful soul on the \nplanet, convinced me otherwise. She fled because, since the day I was born, they said they were trying to rob, \nkidnap, and even kill her. When I first heard President Obama's speech on DACA years ago, I saw the light at the \nend of the tunnel. DACA granted me everything to live a normal life and, for once, belong. It was temporary, but I \nfelt real. I graduated high school at the top percent in my class. I was first in my family, and I was blessed to start \ncollege and earned a scholarship that paid for my first 2 years. [[Page H922]] This December I will be finishing up \nmy EMT school. In the future, I hope to complete 2 more years of paramedic and attain an associate in emergency \nservices. I have a brother that drowned when I was younger. In my home country, you can forget that police and an \nambulance will arrive or even bother to come if you call. My only hope is to save as many lives as I can or die \nrisking my life for another person. {time} 1130 I know DACA can be taken away. I won't be able to drive to my \ncollege or work to pay off my college tuition. My scholarship will be terminated, I will be deported and eventually left \nwith nothing to live for. I pray for an opportunity to stop feeling like that. There isn't room for me here. You see, it is \namazing the effect on public policy and people's lives. That is why I want the Record to show, again, that everyone, \nforevermore in the history of the United States of America, will know that these DREAMers are part of that history \nand that their stories will be there to make judgments about us as to how we have responded to their greatness. \nNayelli Valdemar says: ``I am an AP scholar. I am a distinguished high school graduate. I am a cum laude student. \nI am a leader. I am a recipient of scholarships in merit and circumstance. I am also an illegal immigrant. ``Well, \nallow me to rephrase. I am an illegal immigrant until the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive action \nwhere President Obama gave me the opportunity to live as a resident here in the United States. DACA has opened \nmany doors for DREAMers such as myself. Honestly, it has made the path to success miles more tangible. Inspiring \nme to be the best I can, even when the odds plotted against me, DACA was, and is, there to give a helping hand. \nRegarding my academic record, neither am I writing to boast about my accomplishment nor to ask for pity in the \nright situation, I am here to thank anyone and everyone who made DACA not only possible, but DREAMers' dreams \ncome true. I'm writing to give thanks for the faith the creators of DACA gave me when the compassion of the world \nseemed to turn a blind eye my way. With this letter, I only hope to help the new Presidential administration \nunderstand why DACA is a vital part of every DREAMer's life. ``As a poverty-stricken female immigrant, I have \nmoved mountains to get to where I am today, but this never would have been possible without the assistance of \nDACA. Playing an important role in my life, DACA is a pinnacle to the rights I cherish every day. Because of DACA, \nI have been able to get a job to assist my family. It was not easy working 30-plus-hour shifts, only to be welcomed \nby house chores and schoolwork, especially since I graduated from a magnet school, the Science Academy of \nSouth Texas, a school notorious for its workload. . . . ``My hopes lie in that the generosity of this Nation continues \nto allow all DREAMers a fighting chance for our future, our hopes, and our aspirations to become more than just \nDREAMers. ``Please, please, let it be known that all DREAMers appreciate the assistance this Nation has given us \nthrough DACA. Futures have been opened for DREAMers who were once on uncertain roads, thanks to the help of \n\n\n\nDACA. I hope this Nation does not give up on us. I hope this Nation continues to believe in its DREAMers. I hope \nthis Nation continues to see why DACA is necessary. After all, this Nation is all that most DREAMers have. Our \nlives are under the weight of this country's mercy. Although, as much as we work, as much as we learn, as much as \nwe pray, all we can truly do is hope and dream for a hopeful tomorrow, a brighter road ahead, a chance to dream \nagain. Nayelli Valdemar.'' Nayelli, in this statement, talks about praying. That is why I am so glad I mentioned at the \nbeginning the three Bs: the Bibles, the badges, and the business community. They are so supportive of giving relief \nto the DREAMers. Let's talk about the Bibles. I talked about the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the Good \nSamaritan, the dignity and worth of every person's spark of divinity, that God, Christ coming down, bringing his \ndivinity to humanity enabled us, our humanity, to participate in his divinity, and that is that spark that we all have, \nevery single one of us. So we have to respect it in others but be responsible for it in ourselves, and that is the \nchallenge that we have. ``Hope,'' sitting there between ``faith'' and ``charity,'' the goodness of others--we all have \nhope that when we have needs, we believe, we have faith that others will be there for us, and that is what America \nis about. America is great because America is good. I say it over and over again. This fabulous, greatest country in \nthe history of the world, think about it, our Founders, how courageous they were. They decided to declare war on \nthe greatest naval power, then, in the world, the British Navy, the British military. They declared, in the Declaration \nof Independence, their grievances against the king, but they also stated their aspirations about people being \ncreated equal. No country had been founded on that principle before, and our inalienable rights under God, just \nremarkable, bestowed on them by Our Creator. This is a remarkable people. And then they fought the war, they \nwon the war, they established our founding documents. My daughter wrote a movie on it--well, she didn't write \nbecause it was written by our Founders, but she produced a movie on words that made America--our Declaration, \nour Constitution, our Bill of Rights. And thank God they had the brilliance to make our Constitution amendable. And \nit being amendable, it became this incredible document with the Bill of Rights, and then others that we take an oath \nto protect and defend. At the same time as they did that, they created the great seal of the United States of \nAmerica. I referenced it earlier. It is on the dollar bill. You see that triangle with the eye? It used to scare me when I \nwas little. What is that? A pyramid with an eye? But under it, it says: ``Novus Ordo Seclorum.'' Catholics know that \n``seclorum, seclorum, seclorum'' means ``forever and ever and ever.'' But in this, it is ``new order for the ages.'' \nThey had so much confidence in what they had established and what they were doing that was so new and fresh to \nthe world. They became a beacon to the world. But in doing this new order for the ages, they had confidence and \noptimism that this would last forever because it was predicated on the idea that every generation would take \nresponsibility and make the future better for the next. I said it earlier: The American Dream. People flocked to our \nshores bringing their aspirations, hopes, determination, and courage to make the future better for their families. And \nin adopting them, their traits were like American traits, characteristics of optimism, hope, courage, and making the \nfuture better. And all these newcomers to our shores, they made America more American with their commitment to \na better future for their families, and that continues to this day. And these young people now are called DREAMers. \nTheir parents had a dream for them to bring them to our country, but they completely adapted to our way of always \nbeing dreamers about a better future in our country. They learned from the American people. They taught the \nAmerican people. It is a beautiful relationship. And now we have an opportunity to show our greatness as a country, \nto honor the values of our Founders, the courage they had to find a path, a solution, a result, so that we can put this \naside and address other issues that relate to immigration, which are a bigger picture, more complicated, take more \ntime, require more public debate. Why can't we just do this? This is discrete. Congresswoman Michelle Lujan \nGrisham, the chair of the Hispanic Caucus, said this so beautifully when we testified before the Rules Committee on \nimmigration, on the Dream Act. She said: Think of this bill like CHIP. CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, is about the children. It is not a bill that talks about universal healthcare, the whole healthcare system of \nour country. It is about the children. We have the immigration issue similar to being a big comprehensive issue, but \nthen we have this little piece that is for the children. I think it was the perfect analogy. CHIP is healthcare for the \nchildren. It doesn't address the whole healthcare system, changes that people may want to make or improve or \nchange. It is [[Page H923]] about the children. It is an easy path for us to go down, recognizing that it is not a \nsubstitute for what we need to do to address immigration reform in our country, but a first step, not a step instead \nof. And it is a confidence-building step that we can find common ground in, in a bipartisan way, and we must, if it is \ngoing to be sustainable, just as the bill was in 1986 that President Reagan improved upon with his family fairness \ninitiatives. So that is why let's just think of it as about the children. We should always be thinking about the children. \nThey are the future. They own the future. They are it. And when children come to Washington, D.C., and they visit \nand see how we honor our Founders, George Washington, Lincoln--later to save the Union, Lincoln--but earlier, \n\n\n\nThomas Jefferson, et cetera, and walk these Halls and see tributes to people who went before, we say: In most \ncases, this is about respecting contributions these people made to our country, especially our big monuments on \nThe Mall, and most recently, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., there. We honor them, we learn from them, we value \nthem. But what we do here is values-based on how they taught us. But it is about the future, and this is about how \nwe can go into the future making distinctions, discerning. Discerning, having the ability to say there is some things \nwe can get done, let's do them; other things take more time. Let's build confidence, build bridges in what we do, \nagain, always trying to do it with bipartisanship, with transparency so people know what the debate is and what is in \nthe bill, and that brings unity to our country. I think that is very possible. I am very proud to read these statements \ninto the Record, and I will continue to do so. But during the night, when I was thinking and praying so hard about \nour DREAMers, I thought maybe we should just pray all day on the floor of Congress. Maybe I should bring my \nrosary blessed by the Pope, blessed by His Holiness Pope Francis, or the one before that, Benedict. I had the \nhonor and privilege of receiving rosaries blessed by several Popes in my lifetime, but I always remember Pope \nBenedict. When he came, he spoke so beautifully. He spoke so beautifully. His first encyclical is called, ``God is \nlove.'' In it, he quotes St. Augustine, who, 17 centuries ago, said: ``Any government that is not formed to promote \njustice is just a bunch of thieves.'' That is what St. Augustine said 17 centuries ago. He, Benedict, His Holiness, \ngoes on to say: Sometimes it is hard to define what justice is, but in doing so, we must beware of the dazzling \nblindness of power and special interest. That is what he said. But this doesn't have any of that. This has social \njustice, it has camaraderie, it has good spirit. It is based on faith, hope, and charity. Pope Francis, when he came, \nspoke so beautifully, as he always does, about respecting immigrants. He is living in a much more complicated \nworld of immigrants coming into Europe, but, again, respecting the dignity and worth of every person. And he \ncame here in this Chamber and spoke about a few subjects. As you recall, one of them was poverty and how we \nrespect the dignity and worth of people that Christ mentioned so many times in the Bible. As we know, poor people \nare mentioned in the Bible hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times because of how important our \nresponsibility is to them. But he also talked about immigration. He talked about immigration in a very important way. \nAnd as I get his statement, I will instead read from Gloria Rinconi, a medical assistant from Dallas, Texas. She said: \n``I am a girl who you graduated next to, the girl who you talked to daily, the girl who has finally decided to step away \nfrom the shadows and into the light for you to see her. ``See me as for who I am, not for someone who told you I \nwould be. ``I immigrated to the United States when I was a year old with my parents. My parents had taken the \ndecision to immigrate to USA due to being in a country that offered no future for their family. Even though both my \nparents ran a successful business and my mom had a college education, the violence and underemployment was \nno future for us. The first place we called home was a small apartment in Dallas, Texas, who we shared with \nanother family. We lived in Texas for a year and moved to Statesville, North Carolina. We then moved to the \noutskirts of the little town in some rundown trailer homes. ``We had nothing. My parents slept on the floor while I \nmade a makeshift bed out of a piece of cardboard and a blanket. After months of saving up money, my dad finally \nhad enough to rent an apartment near downtown Statesville. After 9 years, we moved again to Texas. Growing up, \nmy parents never hid the fact that I was undocumented from me. They always told me, `Just because you were \nnot born here, does not mean you are any less. You are loved by many, regardless of what you might hear on TV.' '' \n``Those words became my rock when I was in high school. When I was a freshman, my mom was diagnosed with \nstage 4 breast cancer. For months she struggled trying to find treatment at an affordable rate. Doctors would turn \nher down simply because of her illegal status, even though she offered to negotiate a payment plan. She was dying, \nand no one seemed to care. Her only sin was to be an undocumented woman with stage 4 cancer. She eventually \nfound treatment, but I had seen firsthand how dehumanizing people can be towards the undocumented. During \nthis time, DACA was put into place and it officially opened the door for me. . . . {time} 1145 ``DACA gave me wings, \nthe wings I hoped for all my life when I was in school. I participated in national pageants placing as a national \nachievement finalist. I graduated high school with a medical assistant certification and became a recipient of \nTheDream.US scholarship, which helped me pursue my higher education. DACA has also given me a chance to \ngive back to other DREAMers by being an intern at My Undocumented Life blog.'' ``U.S. DACA recipients are not \nhere to harm the U.S. The U.S. is our home and will always be our home. We are part of the fabric that makes the \nAmerican flag. For that, I am willing to come out of the shadows so you can see me.'' Again, this American Dream \nof making the future better is recurring in all of these stories, and in all of these stories there has been success. \nAgain, though, it is not just about the DREAMers. It is about who we are. Luis Roberto. I talked about Luis already. I \ngave his speech. We had his speech from his graduating class. Luz Divina writes: ``I came to the U.S. from . . . \nMexico when I was 2 months old. I didn't know I was undocumented until sophomore year of high school when I \n\n\n\nrealized I couldn't get a driver's permit, apply for jobs, or go to college programs like all my friends were doing. I felt \ndepressed and oppressed for years until I finally applied for DACA when Obama implemented his executive order. I \nfinally had a chance at the real world. I started a collective in high school named `The Luzdivina Collective' that \nhelped DREAMers in my high school and victims of social injustice in my community. I am currently trying to get \ninto education--either ethnic studies or art, maybe both. The announcement of DACA ending has put me back into a \nstate of depression, but I'm trying my hardest to overcome this with the help of my friends and family. My dream is \nto be an educator, activist, and writer, to inspire DREAMers like myself who are currently or have been in a state of \ndepression due to their legal status.'' We have to remember how strong the DREAMers are but how fragile some of \ntheir existence is when they have no certainty as to what the next steps will be for them. Again, this is all about \nfamily, about parents who had the courage to bring their children at an early age to America. This happened 100 \nyears ago. Do you think all of the people who came here all came documented? Maybe we should all look up our \nancestry and just find out what the facts are about that. We assume so, but do we really know? And there are many \npeople--as I said earlier, Italians were called wops, without papers. That was a derogatory term. It is disgusting for \nme to say it, being an Italian American and so proud of my heritage. As I said earlier, we [[Page H924]] grew up \nthinking that the world was divided among two people in America: those who were Italian American and those who \nwanted to be Italian American. Certainly, it feels that way in Little Italy in Baltimore, where I grew up, and in San \nFrancisco, whom I have the honor to represent. But, in any event, we all take pride in our heritage, and that is the \nbest--best--qualification for recognizing the pride that other people take in their heritage. I say this to the Italian \nAmericans all the time: Because I am so proud to be an Italian American, I understand full well why people from \nMexico or Puerto Rico or Africa or wherever they are from take pride in who they are, their dignity, the authenticity \nof their heritage, and who they are. And in America, that beauty, the beauty is in the mix. It certainly is in my district. \nBut in some communities, the contributions of immigrants are not as recent as in others. But in every community, it \nhas made a difference, constantly reinvigorating America. And so when His Holiness Pope Francis came to speak \nhere in the Congress, as a Catholic Italian American--that is the essence of my being--it was really a thrilling day. It \nwas for all of us, regardless of our background or our faith. I was particularly thrilled to hear what he said about \nimmigration. But you recall, he talked about Martin Luther King and the march from Selma to Montgomery. He \ntalked about people living in poverty, and he talked about a number of subjects, but I will just speak to what he said \nabout immigration. The Pope solemnly said: ``In recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue \ntheir dream of building a future in freedom. We, the people of this continent''--because, as you know, His Holiness is \nthe first Pope from the Western Hemisphere. ``We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners \nbecause most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants''--Italian, by the way. ``I say \nthis to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants. \nTragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected. For those people and their \nnations, from the heart of American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation. Those first \ncontacts were often turbulent and violent, but it is difficult to judge the past by the criteria of the present. \nNonetheless, when the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must not repeat the sins and errors of the past. We \nmust resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to turn their back on \nour `neighbors' and everything around us. Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to \nothers, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our \nbest. I am confident we can do this.'' How beautiful. And then he goes on to talk about immigration in the rest of the \nworld. And then he says: ``We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to disregard whatever proves \ntroublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'' I will submit \nhis whole statement for the Record because it goes on in such a beautiful, beautiful way. It also talks about climate \nin there, Laudato Si, which is his first encyclical about God's creation, this planet, and our responsibilities to be \ngood stewards of it. I am talking about His Holiness. Getting to the Bible is part of it. We talked about the Bible \nearlier. I thought maybe we could say a Rosary on the floor of the House, not just five decades, the full Rosary, all \nof the mysteries of the Rosary, that is 15 decades of the Rosary. But, nonetheless, I think these people telling their \nstories are very prayerful, and so I will use the time to put their stories on the Record. But let me just say how proud \nI am of the statements made by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, their courage in fighting for immigrants \nacross our country, from our cardinals, our bishops, et cetera, from their esteemed platforms, whether it is the \nDREAMers or TPS or comprehensive immigration reform. But right now, today, we are talking about the \nDREAMers. The evangelicals in our country, Reverend Sam Rodriguez' statements, have been so spectacular \nabout, again, the spark of divinity that exists in every person that must be respected, strong supporters of President \n\n\n\nTrump also believing that it is possible for all of us to have enough goodness in our hearts to get this job done, go \npast any obstacles that may be there. Again, the Southern Baptist Convention, their leadership, all across the \nspectrum, of course, the Jewish community, across the full spectrum of faith-based organizations, all speaking out \nand rallying as people rallied when we first saw the Muslim ban. The people of faith are people of faith. They \nbelieve, and they believe that we have obligations to each other. They have spoken out in a very courageous way. \nIn terms of the badges, I told you some stories about DREAMers who have come forth to help with law \nenforcement. By and large, we have had strong support from the law enforcement community about support for the \nDREAMers. And the business community, oh, my, they have been spectacular in terms of raising the profile, \ntreating their employees who are DREAMers with respect, advocating for them. And this Congress of the United \nStates, they seem to have a strong voice on some issues. I wish they would be listened to as attentively on issues \nof social justice here. But they do have access. And one of the things I want to praise them for is I think that the 90 \npercent, 80 percent, 70 percent ratings, depending on if it is citizenship or what, but the high numbers across the \nboard for DREAMers would not have been possible without people hearing from the bishops, from law enforcement, \nand from the business community making this a very high-profile issue about how their companies have benefited \nfrom the DREAMers and how they truly believe. This is not an issue that is going to go away. It is a value. It is not \nan issue. It may be a subject for legislation, but this is an American value that is deeply felt across the board. And I \nam determined that the stories of at least some of these DREAMers--I can't do 800,000, although I am willing to \ntake the time. That might lose impact after awhile, after some of these great stories. Listen to Maneri: ``I'm 18 years \nold and from Los Angeles. I just graduated high school and will be attending UCLA to study political science in the \nfall. Being an undocumented student has been tough. Coming to this country at 6 years old completely changed \nmy life. Learning English and doing well in school was a battle since everyone in my finally only spoke Spanish. . . . \nBeing a DREAMer also shaped who I am, what I stand for. . . . After graduation, I hope to go to law school. . . . '' I \nalready told you this story, but it bears repeating. ``I dream that one day, your immigration status doesn't define \nyour path. . . . '' Alonso: ``Growing up undocumented in Utah truly shaped me into the person I am today. My \nexperiences growing up in the margins of society inform the work I do and the work I seek to continue doing in this \nlife. I am passionate about working with undocumented students and families and strive to share all of my \nknowledge and experiences with the undocumented community as well the community as a whole. ``I was born in \nPeru and emigrated to the United States when I was 11. I arrived in Utah with my brother to unite with our mother, \nwho had come to the U.S. a year before our arrival. Six months after arriving in the U.S. with a tourist visa, my visa \nexpired. . . . '' So he came into the country with legal status. And this is something I think that is really important. Not \neverybody who is undocumented came here in an undocumented fashion. Some of the documentation is expired \nand, in the case of DACA, just a question of when the mail hit and what day it was received by the government. ``I \nwas 12 and a hardworking student, earning good grades working toward a future that would allow me to repay my \nmom for all of her sacrifices. As a high school student, I enrolled in honors and AP courses, which challenged \n[[Page H925]] me and furthered my plans of earning a higher education. ``I graduated from high school with a \ndiploma of merit and went to the University of Utah, where I would major in sociology and be mentored by incredible \nindividuals. Most pointedly, Matt Bradley Ph.D., rest in peace 2012; Caitlyn Cahill, Ph.D.; and David Quijada \nCerecer, Ph.D. My mentors showed me that my work, insight, and contributions as an undocumented student are \nimportant. . . . '' Now, imagine, this child came in documented but became undocumented when the visa expired. \n``. . . and I truly owe them for showing me that I matter for being who I am. ``In 2013, I graduated from the \nUniversity of Utah with an honors bachelor of science in sociology, and in 2016 with a master's in education . . . with \nan emphasis on higher education administration. I am currently the Dreamer Program Coordinator for the University \nof Utah, which is the first center for DREAMers in the State of Utah.'' God bless you, Utah. ``In the future, I would \nlike to pursue a Ph.D. in sociology with a focus on immigration and labor studies.'' This is important because, once \nagain, as has been consistent in these themes, the DREAMers are grateful for the mentoring they have received \nfrom people in our country, some of whom shared their heritage, most of whom did not. That is the beautiful thing \nabout the DREAMers: they know that they have a dream, but somebody else had a plan for their own dream that \ninspired the DREAMers to have their plan. {time} 1200 When Yuri Hernandez was only 3 years old, her family \nbrought her to the United States from Mexico. Yuri grew up in the town of Coos Bay in Oregon. In high school, she \nwas an honor roll student who was very active in her community. Yuri went on to attend the University of Portland, \nwhere she graduated with a bachelor's degree in social work. Yuri is now a graduate student at the University of \nMichigan School of Social Work. She is planning to graduate with a master's in social work in the fall of 2017. In \nher spare time, she tutors and mentors high school students. Yuri dreams of becoming a social worker and giving \n\n\n\nback to her community. Rey Pineda was brought to America when he was 2 years old. The first in his family to \nattend college and a devout Catholic, Rey is now a priest in the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta, Georgia. If \nDACA is eliminated, Father Rey will lose his legal status and could be deported back to Mexico, a tragedy for \nFather Rey and his congregation. After the most divisive election in recent memory, Father Rey and other DACA \nrecipients have a key role to play in healing the differences that divide us. Oscar Cornejo, Jr., was brought to Park \nCity, Utah, when he was 5 years old. He was an excellent student throughout his childhood and now attends \nDartmouth. If DACA is eliminated, Oscar will lose his legal status and could be deported back to Mexico, a country \nhe hasn't lived in since he was 5 years old. Will America be stronger if we deport Oscar? Will America be stronger if \nwe deport Oscar, or if he stays here and achieves his dream of becoming an educator? The answer is clear. DACA \nworks. Lisette Diaz was just 6 years old when her family brought her to the U.S. from Chile. Growing up in Long \nIsland, Lisette excelled in school and was involved in her community. She went on to attend Harvard, where she \nreceived numerous awards and participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. Lisette recently graduated \nHarvard with honors. Lisette and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country, but Donald Trump \nand other Republicans have made their agenda clear. They want to shut down DACA and DAPA and deport \nhundreds of thousands of DREAMers and American children. That is Lisette's view. I hope that we have a better \nunderstanding of where the President may be on this. We don't want Lisette to be deported back to Chile, a country \nwhere she hasn't lived since she was 6 years old. When Cynthia Sanchez was just 7 years old, her family came to \nthe United States from Mexico. Cynthia grew up in Denver, Colorado, and was an excellent student. She went on to \nattend the University of Denver, where she received numerous awards and scholarships and was an active \nvolunteer. In 2010, Cynthia graduated from college with a degree in cognitive neuroscience, which is a double \nmajor in psychology and biology, as well as a minor in chemistry. In 2013, she applied for DACA and was approved \nthat summer. By September, Cynthia was working at Northwestern University in Chicago doing clinical research in \nthe Department of Medicine's Division of Cardiology. Her research focuses on improving treatment for patients who \nsuffer from heart disease. Cynthia said: ``DACA has meant a new realm of opportunities for me, it has opened new \ndoors for me, and it has allowed me to once again see my dream as a reality. I truly believe that if those opposed to \nDACA or the Dream Act had a chance to sit and chat with undocumented students, their opinions might change. \nThey would see capable, smart, hardworking individuals who are Americans in every sense of the word, love this \ncountry, and want to contribute to its prosperity. After all, this is our home.'' That is really very beautiful. I do believe \nthat the more our colleagues know the DREAMers, the better it will be for our country. Vasthy Lamadrid came to the \nUnited States from Mexico when she was only 5 years old. Despite her family's modest means, Vasthy felt safe and \nexcelled in school. Math was her best subject, and she had nearly perfect scores on standardized tests. In middle \nschool, Vasthy discovered the love of engineering. She excelled academically and was active in her community. \nVasthy has gone on to attend Arizona State University, again, I mention, a great school. Because of her \nimmigration status, she does not qualify for any government assistance and has to pay out-of-state tuition, despite \nhaving lived in Arizona for most of her life. To help pay for her education, Vasthy decided to crowdfund her college \neducation. Vasthy shared her story online, and this brought in enough contributions to pay for her tuition. She is \ncurrently in her second year of college. In her first semester, she made the dean's list with a 3.79 GPA in the Ira A. \nFulton Schools of Engineering. Thanks to DACA, Vasthy is able to work to support herself and volunteer in her \ncommunity. As a result of her volunteer work, Vasthy has decided that she wants to become a science teacher. \nOkay. So I have been going through some of these rather quickly in order to get as many of them in the Record as \npossible. But I do want to change my pace a little bit because some of these stories are so emotion-filled, and I can \nplace the statement in the Record, but I want to deliver the stories. I am trying to be respectful of other people's \ntime, but I am also trying to be respectful of the challenge that we face and the need for us to find a solution which \nis clear in sight for our DREAMers. Fernando's family came to the United States when he was 9 years old. In high \nschool, Fernando was an AP Scholar and received the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the achievement \naward in foreign language for French. Fernando continued to excel academically at Santa Clara University, where \nhe graduated cum laude with a double major in biology and french. Now a third-year doctoral student at UC San \nFrancisco--the ultimate, fabulous place, right--Fernando--it is very hard to get in--works at the UCSF Helen Diller \nFamily Comprehensive Cancer Center, where he is working hard to provide new insights into many diseases and \ndisorders. Again, giving back. Denisse Rojas--in 1990, Denisse tells her story that when she was an infant, her \nparents carried her across the Southwest border with the hope of giving her and her siblings a better life. Just think \nof this family, so courageous. Denisse's family settled in Fremont, California. [[Page H926]] Denisse said, in her \nwords: ``In grade school, I recall feeling different from my peers; my skin color was darker, my English was stilted, I \n\n\n\nwas poor, and I was undocumented.'' In 2012, when President Obama established DACA, Denisse's life changed. \nAs a DACA recipient, Denisse's dreams finally seemed within reach. She was able to apply to medical schools that \nbefore would have turned her away because of her immigration status. This meant that she could focus on pursuing \na career in medicine and no longer fear the possibility of losing the only home she had ever known. Denisse said: \n``I have pledged allegiance to this Nation's values since my first day of school; I consider the United States my \nhome. Furthermore, serving others has instilled in me the notion that everyone deserves the opportunity for \nprosperity. I thus aim to dedicate my life to serving others as a physician and continuing to be a voice for \nimmigrants.'' Reading Denisse's story about her being concerned in grade school, ``I recall feeling different from \nmy peers; my skin color was darker, my English was stilted,'' I am reminded of my own grandson. He is Irish, \nEnglish, whatever, whatever, and Italian American. He is a mix, but he looks more like the other side of the family, \nshall we say. When he had his sixth birthday, he had a very close friend whose name is Antonio. He is from \nGuatemala, and he has beautiful tan skin, beautiful brown eyes, and the rest. This was such a proud day for me \nbecause when my grandson blew out the candles on his cake, I said: ``Did you make a wish? And he said: ``Yes, I \nmade a wish.'' We said: ``What is your wish.'' He said: ``I wish I had brown skin and brown eyes like Antonio.'' It \nwas so beautiful, so beautiful. The beauty is in the mix. The face of the future for our country is all-American, and \nthat has many versions. Kok-Leong Seow: ``None of my friends from my hometown know. My parents raised me to \nbe gritty, never to complain or take handouts. I didn't want to have a victim mentality or be known for being \nundocumented. But I realized that sharing my story would be therapeutic, raise awareness, and help other \nunderprivileged people. ``I came to America when I was 6 years old. My parents grew up poor and risked so much \nto move us here with hopes of giving us a better life. My dad is a waiter at a small restaurant, which is enough to \nput food on the table and clothes on our backs. We pay taxes, abide by all laws, and don't live on welfare. ``As for \nme, I can't legally work, drive, fly, or have health insurance. I've missed out on numerous opportunities because of \nmy situation. Fortunately, I was able to pursue college. ``Fast forward 4 years, I have graduated magna cum laude \nin computer engineering from Wichita State University. I was at the top of my class, number one in my major, wrote \ntwo first-author papers, won research awards, and have a patent pending. ``Consequently, I was accepted into \ngraduate school at Columbia University. However, due to my status, I'm unable to obtain a stipend to continue my \neducation. Receiving DACA would grant me the opportunity to acquire the funding I need, provide for my family, \nand master my craft to realize my full potential. But due to election results, applying for DACA is simply not a \nfavorable option anymore. ``Without DACA, many live in daily fear of deportation. I've had friends whose families \nwere torn apart.'' This is Kok-Leong Seow. ``These are genuine, everyday struggles, and it's easy to dismiss it \nbecause it's not happening to your family. To truly empathize, you need to dig deep and allow yourself to feel our \npain and our anxiety.'' This is a very important message, for us to dig deep and experience their pain and anxiety. \n``Many non-Native Americans seem to forget that they, too, have immigration in their blood. Just like everyone else, \nwe simply want an opportunity to contribute to the only home that we know. Ironically, I've enjoyed the adversity. I \nfeel alive under pressure. I am unfazed and undocumented. I'm not going anywhere.'' He is not leaving. Gladys \nKlamka, Phillispburg, New Jersey. ``Patience and heartache is how I would describe my past. I was 2 when my \nfamily made the most important decision for us. Moving to the U.S. meant a second chance for me. If we had \nstayed in Mexico, my folks would have made a decision to give me up for adoption. We settled in NJ for economic \nrelief. ``Unfortunately, at the age of 4, my innocence was stolen from me. I was sexually molested by a 16-year-old \nboy, but my parents didn't report it, they didn't understand the law, for fear of deportation. Both of my parents \nworked full time to keep a roof over our heads. I wasn't able to go off to college financially or drive or travel. I got \nused to doors slamming in my face,'' Gladys writes. ``I was about 14 when my parents explained to me about our \nstatus. Confused about my future, I decided to push harder. I finished school, worked full time, and contributed \nback to the community. ``I received a taxpayer ID issued by the IRS in 1997. I always thought it was funny that the \ngovernment will take our money but not let us work legally in this country. ``I applied for DACA in 2012. I still \nremember the day I opened my approval letter. My father said: `Now I don't have to worry about you.' ``I now own \nmy own home, car, and I work in the healthcare system. After election day, I wondered if this dream would soon \nend. It's been a hard reality check that privileges could be taken away. I only hope for other young DREAMers and \nundocumented children like myself to make the leap to push that shut door open, to know a dream of wanting \nmore is not impossible.'' This is one of the DREAMers I met at the State of the Union. Perhaps you remember, \nAmerica is her name. She was the guest of David Price from North Carolina, and she spoke at our press event with \nthe DREAMers. America immigrated to the U.S. when she was 2 years old and has lived in Raleigh, North Carolina, \nfor 22 years. Thanks to DACA, she was able to earn bachelor's and master's degrees. She now teaches English as \n\n\n\na second language at Sanderson High School in Raleigh. She was just so lovely. We thank David Price for \nintroducing her to us. Another guest at that same press conference, as some of you may recall, was the guest of \nSenator Kamala Harris. Denea Joseph is her name. Denea is a DACA recipient who came to America from Belize \nwhen she was 7 years old without her mother, father, or siblings. She attended the University of California, Los \nAngeles, where she advocated for the creation of an immigration attorney position and worked to increase financial \naid for undocumented youth across the UC system. I wish you could have heard her personally tell her story with \nsuch intellect and such passion. {time} 1215 She goes on here to say: As a Young People For fellow, Denea \naddressed undocumented youths' educational access and retention. Her story was featured in the LA Magazine's \nhistoric immigration issue, and is currently on display as part of the Undocumented Stories Exhibit at downtown \nUCLA Labor Center. She is a communications coordinator for UndocuBlack Network--UndocuBlack is a resource to \nus. Many of the DREAMers are Black--where she advocates for the representation of UndocuBlack immigrants \nwithin the mainstream immigrant narrative. She aspires to be a human rights attorney, advocating for the rights of \nthe most marginalized around the globe. I mentioned here that her story is featured in LA Magazine's historic \nimmigration issue and is on display at the downtown UCLA Labor Center, and now it will be part of the \nCongressional Record. Miriam Ochoa-Garibay said: ``I'm 18 years old and I'm a DACA student currently enrolled at \nthe University of California, Riverside. I came here from a Mexican background. I was born in the Mexican state of \nMichoacan, but I've been living in the United States since I was 2. I went to preschool, kinder, elementary, \nintermediate school, and high school in the State of California. I always loved school. I remember being a little girl \nand getting home from school, and the first thing I did was start my homework. I remember that, as early as \nelementary school, [[Page H927]] there was this test called GATE. It was supposed to be the smart kids' test, and \nevery year I passed it. I remember being an honors student. My parents were very persistent on me getting good \ngrades because that meant a better future. It wasn't until I was in high school where I realized that maybe it was \ngoing to take more than just good grades to go to college. I became really aware that I was undocumented. I \nbecame fearful that I was not going to have a `better future' because I was undocumented. I knew that, financially, \nmy parents weren't going to be able to pay for college. So when DACA came into place, it was a huge relief. There \nwas finally a program that accepted me, an undocumented student. DACA means everything to me. Not only do I \nhave financial aid for my college tuition, but I was granted the opportunity to work legally''--to work legally. How \nlovely--``to find a job and be able to make money for my needs. DACA became a reassuring force to many students \nlike myself, whose only desire is to be given an education in order to become a successful factor of this society. I \nam proud to be Mexican, but I'm also proud to be part of America's great educational system. DACA has given me \nthe opportunity to dream of my own white picket fence one day.'' This is interesting to me because, as an Italian \nAmerican myself, I always reference, which is so obvious when people are proud of their heritage, especially newer \nimmigrants, to see the pride that they take in their heritage and the fierce patriotism they have for America. That \nwas what we saw in our community when I was growing up: fiercely patriotic Americans, while very proud of their \nheritage. And that is who people are. That is their authentic self: patriotic Americans proud of their heritage. We \nwant to make this, as was said in this, to be legal. Ana Sanchez is from Elgin, Texas. I don't know if they say Elgin \nin Texas. Ana says: ``Like any other beneficiary of DACA, I, for once, have been given the opportunity to pursue my \ndreams by attaining higher education and a job. I am Ana Sanchez, an 18-year-old undocumented student who \nwas brought to this country when I was only 2 years old. Due to living conditions in my home country, my parents \ndecided to immigrate to the United States to offer me and my sister a much better education and a better future. \nGrowing up, I was aware that I had been born in Mexico, however, I did not know the effects of being \nundocumented until high school came about. Now that I am older, I realize who I am in the eyes of the \ngovernment, and it saddens me to know that people believe these misconceptions of us. I mean, ever since we \narrived to Texas, my dad has risked his health and life by working under dangerous conditions just to earn enough \nmoney to provide food and shelter for my family. When it was announced that DACA would be available for people \nlike me, my family did not think twice. We all knew it was an advantage and a precious opportunity the country had \ngiven us. Finally, we were given the chance to prove that we are part of this country's future and success. \n``Because of DACA, I am able to say that I am a part-time student and part-time staff for an afterschool program. I \nam two steps closer to becoming a businesswoman and a teacher, and that gives me hope. Sadly, however, the \nnew administration has posed threats that will make my hope and my dreams unreachable. If the permit is taken \naway, our hard work will become worthless. I want to give back to this country, so I yearn Congress to give me that \nchance.'' Many of the stories that I have been reading so far have been, but not all, about people in our own \nhemisphere. But it is important to note that many undocumenteds are from the Asian-Pacific region. Many are from \n\n\n\nAfrica or from the Caribbean. That is our hemisphere, but not in terms of Latin America, but in terms of the \nCaribbean. So some are even from other places that are not necessarily ethnically diverse. Here is one story about \nHa Eun Lee. Today I want to tell you about Ha Eun Lee. When Ha Eun was 6 years old, her family came to the \nUnited States from South Korea. She grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Here is what Ha Eun says about her \nchildhood in the United States of America: ``I was fortunate enough to grow up learning that diversity is encouraged \nand differences are not just tolerated but welcomed.'' Ha Eun was a good student and committed to public service. \nIn high school, she was a member of the National Honor Society, received the Principal's Academic Achievement \nAward, and was an Oakland Activities Association Scholar Athlete. She was a member of the track and field team \nfor all 4 years of high school. Ha Eun is now a senior at the University of Michigan, majoring in English. She \nvolunteers with the Red Cross and is the co-president of an organization called The Supply. The Supply raises \nmoney to help students in Nairobi, Kenya, to attain an education. She is from South Korea, an all-American girl, \nnow a co-president of an organization that raises money to help students in Nairobi, Kenya, to attain an education. \nAs co-president, Ha Eun has expanded the organization's efforts to include volunteering locally with Detroit \ncharities. Ha Eun was also a policy and programs intern for the Asian Americans Advancing Justice Center. As Ha \nEun completes her last year of college, she dreams of becoming a lawyer to defend civil rights. Ha Eun wrote me a \nletter, and she said: ``Although I'm legally labeled as an `alien' in this country I call home, I believe I am American. \nAnd I believe this not solely because I live, study, work, and contribute in this country, but because I believe in the \ncore values all Americans shares as a nation: liberty, justice, and prosperity.'' Ha Eun and other DREAMers have so \nmuch to contribute to our country. But without DACA or the Dream Act, they will be deported back to countries \nwhere they haven't lived in since they were children. Will America be a stronger country if we deport people like Ha \nEun? The answer is clear. That is a question that has arisen throughout. We asked it earlier. Will America be a \nstronger country if we deport--fill in the blank with the name? But I love what Ha Eun has said: ``And I believe this \nnot solely because I live, study, work, and contribute in this country, but because I believe in the core values all \nAmericans share as a nation: liberty, justice, and prosperity.'' Tomas Evangelista is a DACA recipient from Auburn, \nCalifornia. At the age of 2, he came to the United States from Mexico with his mother in search of a better life. \nUnfortunately, after a year of being together in the United States, his mother passed away from cancer. Can you \nimagine? His grandparents took him in and he grew up in northern California, where he ran cross country and track \nat Pacer High School. These all-American kids, it is just a beautiful story. Following his high school career, Tomas \nreceived an associate of arts in social science, and, in 2014, he completed his bachelor's of arts degree. Today, he \nworks for the nonprofit organization Latino Leadership Council. He also intends to attend Lincoln Law School in \nSacramento, California, in spring of 2018. Tomas cofounded California Dreamers with fellow DACA recipient Doris \nRomero. They seek to change the negative narratives surrounding immigration with facts. They want to change the \nnarrative with facts, the truth, through sharing personal stories. The ultimate goal is to encourage immigration \nreform and to establish a pathway to citizenship. Vanessa Rodriguez story: ``My name is Vanessa Rodriguez, and \nthey all call me Undocumented Dreamer. Undocumented because I was born south of the United States border, \nand Dreamer because that was the inherent last name that my parents gave me when they risked their souls to \ngive me a better future.'' They called her Dreamer--called her Dreamer as her last name. Vanessa continues to say: \n``I have lived in Texas for 12 years, and for 12 years I have known no other home. My father works in construction \nand my mother works as a housemaid. Their hard work and humble occupations have given my family a chance to \ndo more and dream higher; a chance that [[Page H928]] made me the salutatorian of my class and a recipient of the \nState of Texas Student Hero Award. However, their work only granted me a chance to dream, not a chance to \naccomplish. Only the government could grant me that. So, for years, I lived under the notion of fear and uncertainty. \nDREAMers like me kept their dreams and secured them in a box called `limitations.' It was until the arrival of DACA \nthat things changed for us. DACA enabled us to pursue and achieve more. For me, it meant an opportunity at \npursuing hiring education, obtaining a job, and acquiring something called temporary security. One year of this \nsecurity from deportation was what made the beginning of my dream a success. I was free from fear of deportation \nthat enabled me to gain competence in my abilities.'' People sharing their stories in such a clear way, and, in many \ncases, a very well-written way. Vanessa continues to say: ``A few weeks ago I finished my first semester at the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin''--which is a very hard school to get into, by the way--``and although I was a full-time \nstudent with two part-time jobs, I still managed to obtain an outstanding GPA. DACA has made all these \naccomplishments possible and it has been the difference between simply existing and living a dream. ``As the time \napproaches for the new administration to come in, the fear is starting to become more evident. The uncertainty and \nanxiety is real. ``My question to Congress is: When will you unchain my dreams? When my only hope is taken away \n\n\n\nalongside DACA? Or will you fight to protect students like me from deportation?'' It is not even a fight. It is a simple \ndecision. It is a simple decision. It has been made easy by separating it from the more complicated and \ncontroversial aspects of comprehensive immigration reform, which we must address. It is about the children. It is \nabout the children. Alonso R. Reyna Rivarola's story goes like this. ``I will always remember the day DACA was \nannounced. It was June 15, 2012, and I was camping for a retreat with students, friends, and colleagues from the \nMestizo Arts & Activism Collective, a youth participatory action research collective in Salt Lake City, Utah. At \napproximately 10 a.m., the group took a break from the agenda, which I used to go back to the tent to check on my \nphone. When I turned my phone back on, I was taken aback by the number of text messages, missed calls, and \nvoicemails I was receiving. Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. `` `The Dream Act has passed!' shouted a close \nfriend of mine, a fellow DREAMer, in a voicemail. I was excited, yet confused by her words, knowing at the time no \nDream Act bill was being debated in the U.S. Congress or Senate. However, as confused as I was, I was too \nadrenalized at the possibility that a quiet Dream Act boxcar bill had made its way into becoming a law. ``After \nreturning her call, we shared our feelings of excitement and confusion regarding the matter at hand. Then she \ninformed me President Barack Obama would be making an announcement at any moment. As soon as I hung up, I \nread through a few more text messages, called my mom, and ran outside the tent to inform the MAA family about \nthe news.'' Can you just imagine the excitement? They were out camping. Alonso continues to say: ``Within a few \nminutes, all MAA participants crammed ourselves into two cars in Little Cottonwood Canyon, where we tuned into \nthe radio eager to listen to President Obama announce the program which we all have come to know as \nconsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA.'' {time} 1230 ``My story is one of hundreds of \nthousands of DACA stories across the United States. We all have different backgrounds, first and last names, \ninterests, journeys, and goals; however, we all have at least one thing in common: we are all American DREAMers. \nSince DACA, I have earned an honors B.S. in sociology and M.Ed. in educational leadership and policy from the \nUniversity of Utah. I am an active community member and have most recently been honored to serve as the Dream \nProgram Coordinator at the University of Utah, where I seek to support undocumented students, with and without \nDACA, to access, persist, and achieve a higher education in the country we all call home.'' The way they write these \nstories and the excitement and the anxiety that they convey is really something that the printed word may not \nconvey. But I hope at least the Record will show the cumulative effect of all of these stories. I wish you could see \nthem. A person who has seen more of them than anyone honors us with his presence in the Chamber. We all get \nemotional on this subject, but no one has put more brainpower and passion into this subject than the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois. He has served in this body for a long time, so we know of his leadership and his values. But \nfor all the years he has served in public life before Congress and since, and in the House and now as a leader in \nthe Senate, the DREAMers have been a priority for half of his service in public life. He first introduced the DREAM \nAct in 2001 into the Senate. It was introduced over on our side by Lucille Roybal-Allard around the same time. She \nis the mother, the godmother of the DREAM Act that has been advanced. In 2010, we were able to pass the \nDREAM Act in the House under the leadership of Mr. Durbin, Senator Durbin. It received a majority of the votes in \nthe United States Senate but did not reach the 60 threshold, and so the discussion goes on. As you know, shortly \nthereafter, a couple of years later, President Obama issued the DACA executive order. None of this success would \nhave been possible without the leadership, persistence, optimism, and the courage of Senator Durbin. He has \nheard all of these stories, so many of these stories firsthand for nearly two decades. I congratulate him. And as I \nhave said earlier, our call today is for our Speaker to give the same opportunity to House Members to vote on a \nDREAMers bill, just as they were able to achieve in the Senate. Senator McConnell, the Senate leader, has been \nworking with a bipartisan group of which he has always been a part--it has always been about bipartisanship--\npledged to bring to the Senate floor a vehicle that the Senate will act upon, no guarantees. The Senate will work its \nwill. What dignity that brings to the United States Senate, what commitment to the purpose of America that is there. \nWe feel like second-class Members of Congress over here when it is not within our realm to discuss something that \nis being discussed across the country, in the Senate of the United States, at the White House. But here, we can't \nhave the opportunity to officially discuss legislation that is on the floor. That is why I am taking this time, my \ncongressional leadership 1- minute, to read into the Record these inspiring stories. Again, it brings tears to my \neyes. Excuse me for being emotional about it, but when I think of the contribution that Senator Durbin has made to \nthis, the stories he has heard, the stories he has told--I have seen him receive with great respect and honor across \nthe country getting so many awards from people who see him as a person who understands their anxiety and \nconcern but, as important as that, their possibilities and their contribution to America. That is why, as I said earlier, \nSenator Durbin should think of this as the CHIP versus healthcare; as the chair of the Congressional Hispanic \n\n\n\nCaucus, Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, has described in front of the Rules Committee, think of this as \nCHIP versus healthcare, children versus comprehensive immigration reform. This is one clear opportunity where we \ncan come together not as a substitute for comprehensive, but as a step, confidence building, trust building, in a \nbipartisan way, with transparency and in a unifying way for our country. So I thank the gentleman, Senator Durbin. \nBecause of the leader minute, I am not able to yield; otherwise, I would have nearly 200 people seeking recognition \non the floor to tell the stories of their DREAMers. I have told some of them, but our colleagues are so committed \nand unified on this subject, and their constituents are. But even if a colleague on the other side of the aisle would \nsay, ``Will the gentlewoman yield?'' the rules do not [[Page H929]] allow me to yield, so I am keeping the time. As \nsaid earlier before the gentleman came, I thought about saying the Rosary on the floor to pray for our leadership to \nact with a heart full of love, both here and at the White House, on this subject. I said not just 5 decades, all 15 \ndecades, including the Glorious Mysteries. They were the sad ones in the middle: the Agony in the Garden, the \nCrowning with Thorns, Scourging at the Pillar, the Crucifixion. Then it takes us to the Glorious Mysteries. But all of it \nis prayerful. I believe in prayer. And so many of our, as I call it, Bible constituency--not the National Catholic \nConference of Bishops but the evangelical community-- has been so spectacular in supporting immigrants to our \ncountry and, especially in this case, of DACA. This is the statement of the United States Catholic Conference of \nBishops: ``The president and vice president, along with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops''--\nin this case, meaning the president of the organization--``along with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops have issued a statement denouncing the administration's termination of the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals program after 6 months. ``The following statement from the USCCB''--that is, the United States \nCatholic Conference of Bishops--``President Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, along with USCCB \nVice President Archbishop Jose H. Gomez of Los Angeles; Bishop Joe S. Vasquez of Austin, chairman, Committee \non Migration; and Bishop Joseph J. Tyson of Yakima, chairman of the Subcommittee on Pastoral Care, Migrants, \nRefugees, and Travelers says the `cancellation of the DACA program is reprehensible.' ``Over 780,000 youth \nreceived protection from the DACA program since its inception by the Department of Homeland Security in 2012. \nDACA provided no legal status or government benefits but did provide recipients with temporary employment \nauthorization to work in the United States and a reprieve from deportation.'' A quote by the Bishops: `` `The \ncancellation of the DACA program is reprehensible. It causes unnecessary fear for DACA youth and their families. \nThese youth entered the United States as minors and often know America as their only home. The Catholic Church \nhas long watched with pride and admiration as DACA youth live out their daily lives with hope and a determination \nto flourish and contribute to society: continuing to work and provide for their families, continuing to serve in the \nmilitary, and continuing to receive an education. Now, after months of anxiety and fear about their futures, these \nbrave young people face deportation. This decision is unacceptable and does not reflect who we are as Americans.' \n'' The bishops go on to say: `` `The Church has recognized and proclaimed the need to welcome young people: \n``Whoever welcomes one of these children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not \nwelcome me but the One who sent me''--Mark 9:37.' '' That is so beautiful because what they are saying is, when \nyou reject these newcomers, you are rejecting who sent them, and who sent them but our Lord. Today, our Nation \nhas done the opposite of how Scripture calls us to respond. It has stepped back from the progress that we need to \nmake as a country. ``Today's actions represent a heartbreaking moment in our history that shows the absence of \nmercy and goodwill and a shortsighted vision of the future. DACA youth are woven into the fabric of our society and \nour Church, and are, by every social and human measure, American youth. ``We strongly urge Congress to act and \nimmediately resume work toward a legislative solution. We pledge our support to work on finding an expeditious \nmeans of protection for DACA youth.'' The bishops go on to say: ``As people of faith, we say to DACA youth, \nregardless of your immigration status, you are children of God and welcome in the Catholic Church. The Catholic \nChurch supports you and will advocate for you.'' That is such a beautiful statement. As I noted earlier, tomorrow is \nthe National Prayer Breakfast, and many people who will be gathered there are among those who have been so \nsupportive of our DREAMers. We thank them for their leadership and their courage. I mentioned some earlier. I \ndon't know if these people will be there tomorrow, but certainly members of their church. As I mentioned, Dr. Sam \nRodriguez, Reverend Sam Rodriguez has spoken out as a leader in the evangelical community. So, hopefully, \ntomorrow, as they pray and come together, they will be speaking about what we see from the pulpit, from the \nbishops, from the evangelical community. If you believe that we are all God's creation, as I do, as people of faith do-\n-and I do believe faith is a gift that everyone doesn't have. So you may not have that same perspective, but if you \ndo believe--and I believe that everyone gathered there tomorrow will believe--and many people across our country \nsubscribe to ``In God We Trust,'' then you must subscribe to what the Bible tells us. To minister to the needs of \n\n\n\nGod's creation is an act of worship; to ignore those needs is to dishonor the God who made us, dishonor the God \nwho made us, reflected in the Gospel of Matthew that I referenced earlier. So when we are thinking about this \nsubject, we also have to recognize the diversity in our DREAMer population. In 2002, Luke was 11 years old. His \nfamily brought him to the United States from South Korea. The Senator has left us, but Senator Durbin inspires us. \nHe is such a great leader on this subject because it is from the heart and the right thing to do, but with great \nintellect, to have a vision and a dream, but an intellect with a plan to get the job done. There is a clear path. It exists \nin the Senate. We don't know why that door is shut to us in the House. We call upon the Speaker to open the same \ndoor in the House, through discussion, that is in the Senate. I want to commend, once again, Senator Durbin for \nhis extraordinary leadership. DREAMers know him. In 2002, when Luke was 11 years old, his family brought him to \nNew York State from South Korea. Luke grew up in Palisades Park, New Jersey. Here is what Luke said about \ngrowing up in Palisades Park: ``It didn't take long for me to adjust and assimilate because my elementary school \noffered bilingual classes in Korean and English. This is the kind of America I have known and experienced--not just \nmundanely accepting diversity, but going above and beyond to serve the unique needs of a diverse community.'' \nFrom an early age, Luke had a passion for science. He was accepted into a math and sciences magnet high \nschool called Bergen County Academies, which was ranked by Newsweek as one of the top five public high \nschools in the country. At Bergen County Academies, Luke won several awards at regional science fairs. He also \nvolunteered as an emergency medical technician in the local ambulance corps. In 2013, Luke graduated--are you \nready?--summa cum laude with a bachelor's of science in chemistry and received an award for the highest grade \npoint average of any chemistry major. {time} 1245 This brilliant young man is currently a Ph.D. graduate in \nchemistry at the University of Chicago. He also works as a researcher at the university. In his spare time--in his \nspare time, how does he have spare time--but in his spare time, he also works as a researcher. He volunteers for \nthe Chicago Korean American Resource and Cultural Center, an organization that provides services to \ndisadvantaged members of the community. Good for you, Luke. Consider this: without legal status, Luke's talents \nwould have been squandered. But now, thanks to DACA, when we had DACA, Luke was on the road toward \nmaking his childhood passion into a promising career as a scientist. Luke has written: ``DACA did much more than \nshielding me from deportation and changing my immediate circumstances; it gave me a new faith and brought out a \nnew me to reject fear and continue worthwhile pursuits. DACA has been tremendously empowering. Wherever I \nfind myself in the future, I hope to mentor, encourage, and ultimately empower others.'' [[Page H930]] Luke and \nother DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country. Do we need more talented scientists like Luke Hwang \nin America? Of course we do. Will America be stronger if we deport Luke Hwang or if he stays here to contribute his \ntalents to America's future? The answer should be obvious. I thank Luke. Her parents brought her to the United \nStates from the Philippines when she was 5 years old. Mithi grew up in California. She was an excellent student \nwho dreamed of becoming a doctor. In high school, Mithi was on the principal's honor roll and was an AP scholar. \nShe received the Golden State Seal Merit Diploma and is a Governor's Scholar Award recipient. Mithi was admitted \nto the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the Nation's top universities. Congresswoman Waters would \nattest to that. UCLA is one of the Nation's top universities. We all are proud of the UC system. At UCLA, Mithi \nvolunteers as a research assistant in lab studies of infants at high risk of developing autism. That was her field. She \nalso volunteers as a crisis counselor for UCLA Peer Helpline advising students who are victims of rape, child abuse, \nand substance abuse. Mithi eventually became a trainer for new counselors. Mithi also volunteers as a mentor and \ntutor for at-risk middle school children in Los Angeles. She graduated from UCLA with a degree in psychology. But \nher options were limited, Mr. Speaker, because of her immigration status. She was unable to pursue her dream of \nbecoming a doctor. Then, in 2012, President Obama established the DACA program, and Mithi's world changed. \nMithi began working as a research assistant at the UCLA School of Medicine, and she applied to attend medical \nschool. During her spare time, Mithi continues to volunteer with the Autism Research Lab where she started her \nresearch career 7 years ago. She also serves as a peer mentor to 10 undergraduate students at UCLA. Mithi wrote \nto Congress these words: ``Please, please listen to our stories. This is my home, and the only country I know. \nDACA gives us greater opportunities to give back to the country we love.'' Listen to that sentence again, Mr. \nSpeaker. Mithi wrote: ``DACA gives us greater opportunities to give back to the country we love.'' That is what the \nDREAMers are about. Their dream is to give back to America. They have benefited from our country. They want to \ngive back; and the courage, optimism, and fortitude that they have is really a blessing. Mithi and other DREAMers \nlike her have so much to contribute. Will America be stronger if we deport Mithi and others like her? Will we be a \nbetter country if we tear apart American families? Of course not. This is going to be a hard name for me to \npronounce. It is Jirayut New Latthivongskorn. His parents brought Jirayut to the United States from Thailand when \n\n\n\nhe was 9 years old. New--we will call him New. New grew up in San Francisco. New said: ``I forced myself to read \nmystery novels, dictionary in hand, in order to expand my vocabulary, one word at a time. I mispronounced words, \neven in the face of ridicule, until I mastered the English language.'' New became an excellent student and dreamed \nabout becoming a doctor. Throughout high school, New worked 30 hours a week at his family's Thai restaurant. \nHere is what he said about the experience: ``I spent most of my time at the restaurant working as a waiter, cashier, \nand chef, scrubbing toilets, washing dishes, and mopping floors. It taught me to have faith, work hard, and \npersevere.'' New's hard work paid off. He graduated as a salutatorian of his high school class with a 4.3 grade \npoint average. New was admitted to the University of California, Berkeley, one of the top schools in California--in \nthe Nation. He won a scholarship that would have covered most of his tuition, but he was unable to accept it \nbecause of his immigration status. Despite the setback, New persevered. In May, 2012, he graduated with honors \nwith a 3.7 grade point average with a major in molecular and cellular biology. Just 1 month after he graduated, \nPresident Obama established the DACA program. As a result of DACA, New was able to pursue his dream of \nbecoming a doctor. That fall, New began medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, a very \ndifficult school to get into. During his spare time, he volunteers at the homeless clinic that is run by the students of \nthe University of California, San Francisco. In his spare time. New has cofounded Pre-Health Dreamers, a national \nnetwork of more than 400 DREAMers who are pursuing careers in healthcare. New and other DREAMers like him \nhave so much to contribute to our country. Will America be a stronger country if we deport New and others like him? \nWill we be a better country if we tear apart American families? Of course not. We all agree on that. Aaima Sayed \nwas brought to the United States from Pakistan when she was only 3 years old. She grew up in Chicago like a \ntypical American kid. Aaima says: ``I have no memories but those of living in the United States. I am an American \nin every way, except on paper.'' Aaima was an outstanding student. She graduated in the top 10 percent of her high \nschool class where she was secretary of the Spanish club-- mind you, she is from Pakistan. She was secretary of \nthe Spanish club, secretary of the math team, and a member of the National Honor Society of High School \nScholars. Aaima's dream was to become a physician. Here is how she explains it: ``It completely breaks my heart \nto see thousands of children die of treatable diseases due to inadequate basic healthcare facilities, and I want to \nhave the skills and ability to change that.'' In January 2012, Aaima graduated from Rutgers University magna cum \nlaude, Mr. Speaker, with a major in psychology. She was on the dean's list six times and has a grade point average \nof 3.75 out of 4. She was a research assistant at Rutgers Department of Psychology and an intern with the local \ncardiology practice. Aaima took the medical college admission test, the MCAT, and scored in the 90th percentile--\nbetter than 90 percent of those who took the test. Shortly after she graduated, President Obama announced the \nDACA program. Because of DACA, Aaima is now a medical student at Loyola University pursuing her dream of \nbecoming a physician. After she graduates, she will work in a medically underserved area of Illinois. Here is what \nAaima said about the DACA impact on her: ``I went from feeling hopeless and full of uncertainty regarding my future \nto feeling confident and optimistic that I will one day get the opportunity to help my community and people in other \npoverty-stricken areas.'' But if the House Republicans have their way, Aaima won't be able to attend medical \nschool and become a doctor. Instead, she will be deported back to Pakistan, a country she hasn't lived in since she \nwas a toddler. I wouldn't attribute it to the Republicans. I think that plenty of Republicans are on board to help our \nDREAMers. That is what I am hopeful about, just that we need to be given the chance to have a respectful vote on \nall sides of the issue which we have bipartisan Democrats' strong support, but strong Republican support as well. \nGive us a vote, Mr. Speaker. Give us a chance. Treat this House with the dignity it deserves so that we can \nrepresent the people and the wishes of our country. Will America be stronger if we deport Aaima? Of course not. \nToday, I want to tell you about our Al Okere. Al was born in Nigeria. In 1990, Al's father was killed by the Nigerian \npolice after he wrote a newspaper column criticizing the Nigerian Government. The killing of Al's father was \ndocumented in the State Department's annual Human Rights Reports. In 1995, Al's mother fled Nigeria and brought \nhim to the United States. He was only 5 years old at the time. Al's mother applied for asylum, but her application \nwas denied, and she was deported in 2005, when Al was 15. Now, mind you, her husband had been assassinated \nfor articles that he had written criticizing the Nigerian Government, a well-founded fear of persecution or danger in \nNigeria, yet her application was denied in 2005. Al was 15. [[Page H931]] Al graduated from Rogers High School \nnear Tacoma, Washington. He attended Central Washington University where he was an honors student with a 3.5 \ngrade point average. He was an active volunteer in his community. Here is what Al said about his goals for the \nfuture, and I quote Al very proudly: ``I have been in accelerated academic programs most of my educational life and \nhope to be a medical doctor some day to contribute to the well-being of my fellow humans. I hope to continue to \nemulate and walk in the great academic shoes of my late father, who earned a Ph.D. degree from a university in \n\n\n\nParis, France. My family and community support has been enormous, and it gives me the zeal to work hard in my \nstudies, to be able to lend a hand to others in need, and to realize a bright future!'' Al grew up in this country. We \nhave already invested in Al, who has received his entire education from kindergarten to college in the United States. \nHe has great potential to contribute to our society. He does not remember anything about Nigeria and cannot speak \nany of Nigeria's native languages. Here is what Al said about the possibility of being deported: ``I do not remember \nanything about my mother's country of Nigeria. I cannot even speak the language. Every experience I have had in \nlife that I can remember have been in the United States of America. Everyone I know and care about are all here, \nexcept for my mother, who was sadly removed and remains in hiding in fear of her life.'' Would America be stronger \nif Al Okere were deported? Of course not. Al is not an isolated example. There are literally thousands of others, \nhundreds of thousands of others like him around the country. I thank Al for being so generous in sharing his story. I \nwant to tell you about Novi Roy. Novi Roy grew up in the State of Illinois. Novi was brought to the United States \nfrom India as a child. He attended Evanston Township High School. This is a story that Senator Durbin provided. \nHe attended Evanston Township High School where he graduated with a 3.9 grade point average. During high \nschool, Novi began volunteering at a soup kitchen in Rogers Park in Chicago, which he continues to do today. Novi \nwent to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics. \nNovi graduated from the University of Illinois with two master's degrees, one in business and one in human \nresources. Novi's dream is to be able to provide affordable healthcare to the less fortunate. Here is what he said in \nthe letter he wrote to Dick Durbin: ``I love America for all its opportunities, and, like any other aspiring student, I \nwant a chance to realize the American Dream. I owe the State of Illinois, its taxpayers, and America a huge debt of \ngratitude for the level of education I have attained thus far. I'm confident that my education will serve me well \nenough to make a difference in people's lives. There is nothing I would like more than to give back to the \ncommunity that has been so good to me.'' Novi grew up in this country. We have already invested in Novi, and he \nhas obtained a first-class education in Illinois. He has great potential to contribute to our society. Will America be a \nstronger nation if Novi is deported? Of course not. He has overcome the odds to achieve great success. He would \nmake America a strong country. Again, Novi's story comes to us when he came from India as a child. There is a \nlarge number of Asian-Pacific American Dreamers. Yaniv Steltzer was brought to the United States by his parents \nfrom Israel when he was just 3 years old, a DREAMer from Israel. He grew up in this country like any other \nAmerican child. In 2010, he graduated from Richard Stockton College in New Jersey with a bachelor's degree in \nhospitality and tourism management. {time} 1300 In college, he was the chair of the Jewish Student Union/Hillel \nClub and was an active volunteer with several other student groups. Yaniv's dream is to open a restaurant. He \nwrote a letter, which said: I fell in love with cooking in high school when I took a home-economics class, and I knew \nthis is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I would love to give back to America by opening my own \nrestaurant, creating jobs, contributing to the economy, and becoming a citizen in the country I love. Unfortunately, \nunder our immigration laws, Yaniv cannot become a citizen. His father was born in the United States. But Yaniv was \nborn in Israel, so he is not an American citizen. Yaniv's father applied for Yaniv to become a citizen, but because \nthe process took so long, Yaniv is no longer eligible. Under our immigration laws, once Yaniv turned 21, his father \ncould not petition for Yaniv to become a citizen. So, Yaniv, who has lived his whole life in this country since he was \n3, since his father is an American citizen, he is an undocumented immigrant. The only solution for him is the \nDream Act. Here is what Yaniv said about his situation: America is the only country I know. I grew up here, all my \nfamily and friends are here, and everything I know is America. The Dream Act is important to me and also to many \nothers like me who are in the same situation. We have the resources to help this country greatly, but don't have that \npiece of paper that allows us to do this. I have high hope and optimism that Congress will do the right and humane \nthing, put all political issues aside, and pass the Dream Act. Yaniv is right. I ask my colleagues: Would America be \nbetter off if we deported Yaniv? The answer is very obvious. Eighteen years go, in 1992, Minhaz Khan's parents \nbrought him to the United States from Bangladesh. Minhaz was only 4 years old at the time, and has overcome \ngreat obstacles to complete his education. In 2009, he graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a \nbachelor's degree in neuroscience. Here is what he said about his dreams for the future: ``My dream is to make \nseveral contributions to science, and become a physician's assistant as a career, and eventually a teacher as well. I \nhave great aspirations, but I do not dream of big houses or tons of cars. I want normality, stability, and liberty.'' \nToday, Minhaz lives in Palo Alto, California, with his wife, who is an American citizen. Minhaz spoke about what it \nwould mean for him if the Dream Act were to become law. Here is what he said: ``Imagine the countless numbers of \nindividuals ready to contribute to our society as law-abiding, successful individuals who live life with a sense of \nstrength and morality. Abraham Lincoln once said, `I have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict \n\n\n\njustice,' and this is more true now than ever. I have a great amount of hope, optimism, and belief in this country and \nthat one day we will see the Dream Act enacted into law.'' This is his statement, Minhaz Khan, from Bangladesh. \nAnother child brought here from India, as was an earlier DREAMer, Mandeep Chahal. Mandeep was brought to the \nUnited States from India 14 years ago, when she was only 6 years old. A beautiful little child. Mandeep has been an \nacademic all-star. She was an honors pre-med student at the University of California, Davis, where she majored in \nneurology, physiology, and behavior. Mandeep is also dedicated to public service. In high school, she helped to \nfound One Dollar for Life, a national poverty relief organization. She was voted the member of her class ``Most \nlikely to Save the World. Imagine, most likely to save the world. At her college, Mandeep is the co-president of \nSTAND, an anti-genocide group. Mandeep has so much to offer to our country. She wrote: ``I . . . consider the \nUnited States my only home. My family, friends, and future are in the United States, which is where I belong. My \ndream is to become a pediatrician so I can treat the most helpless and innocent among us. I hope to serve families \nin low-income communities who otherwise are unable to afford medical care. I wish to remain in the United States \nso that I can continue to make a positive difference and give back to the community that has given me so much.'' \nHow beautiful. You see the recurring theme of the DREAMers: wanting to give back to America, appreciative of the \nopportunities they have received here--the mentoring, the friendship, the love; wanting to give back. Dominique \nNkata and Tapiwa Nkata. There are two. [[Page H932]] Tapiwa's and Dominique's parents, John and Joan Nkata, \nbrought their family to the United States from the African county of Malawi in 1990. At the time, Tapiwa was 4 and \nDominique was only 11 months old. The Nkatas came here legally. They had work permits. John, an ordained \nChristian minister, worked as a hospice counselor. Joan, his wife--their mother--worked as an accountant. The \nNkatas filed papers to stay here permanently. For years, their case was stuck in immigration court. Finally, in 2009, \nJohn and Joan Nkata were granted legal permanent residence. But by that time, Tapiwa and Dominique were \nadults and unable to obtain legal status through their parents. That happens at 21. Here is what Dominique said \nabout being deported to Malawi: ``The looming fear of having everything I know, including part of my family, here in \nthe United States, while I am removed to the other side of the world, is crippling.'' Tapiwa said: ``I can't imagine my \nlife in Africa. I am an American. I know this culture and speak this language. I pledge allegiance to this flag.'' It \nwould be wrong to send these women back to Malawi, a country they don't even remember. Remember, one of \nthem was 11 months old when she came. In 2007, Tapiwa graduated summa cum laude from the University of \nCincinnati with a degree in finance. She then worked at an accounting firm. She dreams of becoming a certified \npublic accountant. Tapiwa explained what America means to her: ``Quite simply, when you say `The American \nDream' all around the world, they know what you are talking about. People who have never been to our shores, \neaten our food, or even spoken our language have heard of a prosperous nation that, above all else, grants \nfreedom and rights to all people.'' Dominique graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a degree in chemistry \nand pre-medicine. Remember, her sister graduated summa cum laude with a degree in finance. Dominique \ngraduated with a degree in chemistry and pre-medicine and began working at University Hospital and the Jewish \nHospital in the research department as a clinical studies assistant. Dominique planned to apply to medical school. \nShe said: ``I dream of being a doctor and of giving back to a country that has given so much to me.'' Would America \nbe better off if we deported Tapiwa and Dominique back to Malawi? Of course not. The Dream Act gives them a \nchance. Let me introduce you to another DREAMer, Monji Dolon. Monji's parents brought him to the United States \nfrom Bangladesh in 1991. He was 5 years old. As he grew up in his new home, he immersed himself in the study of \ncomputers and technology. Monji wrote: ``For as long as I can remember, I have had an intense passion for \ntechnology. In middle school, that passion led to spending many nights constructing remote-controlled model \nairplanes and Van de Graaff generators. In high school, I fell in love with computers and the internet, spending my \nsenior year creating an online newspaper for my school.'' Monji did not know about his immigration status until he \nwas applying for college. He asked his parents what to say about his status on his college applications. That is \nwhen Monji learned that he was undocumented. In 2008, Monji graduated from the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill, an outstanding school. Very soon, Monji began to be courted by the technology industry. He was even \noffered a job as the lead engineer for a startup in Silicon Valley. Monji's prospects would be limited because of his \nimmigration status. The Dream Act would give Monji a chance to pursue his dream and contribute his talent to the \ncountry he calls home. Here is what he has to say: ``I've turned down several great jobs from reputable companies \nbecause of my status. The Dream Act would let me take my passion for technology to the next level by allowing me \nto move to Silicon Valley and pursue my dream as an internet entrepreneur.'' So, we have someone like Monji, with \nhis talents, his entrepreneurship, his passion, and his intellect. What a resource to our country. I keep asking the \nquestion: Would America be better off if we deported Monji back to Bangladesh, a country he left when he was 5 \n\n\n\nyears old? Of course not. Herta Llusho was brought to the United States from Albania when she was 11. She and \nher mother settled in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Herta and her mother came to the United States \nlegally. Shortly before arriving in America, Herta's mother filed an application to stay in the United States. Herta \nquickly learned English and became an academic star. She graduated from Grosse Pointe High School with a 4.05 \ngrade point average. In high school, she was a member of the varsity track team, won an Advanced Placement \nScholar Award, and was a member of the National Honor Society. Herta then attended the University of Detroit \nMercy, where she was an honor student and studied to be an electrical engineer. She had a grade point average of \n3.98 and completed two internships at engineering companies. She is from Albania, I remind you. Herta has been \nvery involved with her community, volunteering at homeless shelters, tutoring programs, and her church. Listen to \nwhat one of her friends said about her: ``I am humbled by Herta's willingness and desire to serve. I have had the \nprivilege of going to the same church at which she faithfully serves. She spends hours tutoring kids and \nvolunteering with the junior high Sunday school class. It is a joy to watch so many children run up to her at church \nbecause of the love they receive when they are with her.'' Would it be a good use of taxpayer dollars to deport \nHerta? Of course not. Again, there is so much discussion in the United States about the need for more young \npeople to study what is known as STEM--science, technology, engineering, and math. Of course, we add the arts in \nthere: STEAM. Every year, we issue tens of thousands of H-1B visas to bring foreign students here to work in the \nSTEM fields. Herta is a straight-A student in electrical engineering, a STEM field. She doesn't need an H-1B visa. \nShe is a homegrown talent. Herta came to Capitol Hill to speak at a briefing on the Dream Act. Here is what she \nsaid: ``I'm a typical story. There's thousands of stories out there just like mine. Please support the Dream Act so \nstudents like me don't have to leave. We are worth it. This is the country we have come to love.'' Herta is right. She \nand hundreds of thousands of others are worth it. Eliphaz Omote is 25 years old, and he is from Keith Ellison's \ndistrict in Minnesota. Eliphaz was born in Kenya and came to Minnesota at age 11. He didn't know he was \nundocumented until he graduated from high school. Imagine the maturity of these kids. They are teenagers, they \nare babies, they are 11 years old, and all the rest, and carrying this weight. Growing up is hard enough, right, but \ncarrying this weight? He writes: ``I wanted to go to college and pursue education, but I couldn't. It was a grueling \nexperience, especially for me being a highly driven and ambitious person.'' After DACA, Eliphaz graduated from St. \nCloud State University with a degree in psychology and management. He is about to start classes for a master's \ndegree in divinity at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan. Eliphaz wants to be a chaplain in the United \nStates Senate one day, but he can only do that if the Dream Act passes. The Senate. Maybe the House, if he were \ngiven a chance to, might rise to the level. The Congressional Black Caucus--I mentioned earlier that the \nchairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus--has been very much involved in this issue and they gave me \nthese statistics. There are 5,302 DACA recipients from Jamaica, 4,077 recipients from Trinidad and Tobago, and \n2,095 DACA recipients from Nigeria, just to name a few. There are more, as I mentioned, from Africa, but this just \nnamed the Nigerian ones here. I thank them for their work and the effort on activities that have gone with this. \n[[Page H933]] We have another visitor from Albania. Things were tough in Albania a while back. Our distinguished \ncolleague, Mr. Eliot Engel, has been Albania's best friend from Congress, but he can attest that there was cause to \nleave at an earlier day. Ola Kaso was brought to the United States by her mother from Albania in 1998, when she \nwas 5 years old. Ola went to high school in Warren, Michigan. She was a valedictorian of her class. She took every \nadvanced placement class offered by her school. Are you ready for this? She had a 4.4 grade point average. Ola \nwas on the varsity cross country and tennis teams. She was treasurer of the student council and treasurer of the \nNational Honor Society at her school. She tutors children who are learning English. Ola was also a member of the \nhomecoming court. I don't have her picture here, but she was lovely. {time} 1315 Ola was then accepted into the \nhonors program at the University of Michigan, where she would study premed. Here is what she said about her \ndreams for the future: ``I aspire to ultimately become a surgical oncologist, but more importantly, I intend to work for \npatients that cannot afford the astronomical fees accompanying lifesaving surgeries, patients that are denied the \nmedical treatment they deserve. My goal is not to increase my bank account; my goal is to decrease preventible \ndeaths. I wish to remain in this country to make a difference.'' How beautiful. Thank you, Ola, for sharing your story. \nThis takes a great deal of courage for these young people to share their stories and the intimacy of the personal \nchallenges they face, so we thank them for their generosity of spirit as well as their courage. Steve Li's parents \nbrought him to the United States when he was 11. He studied at City College of San Francisco, where he majored \nin nursing and was a leader in student government. Here is what Steve said: ``My dream is to become a registered \nnurse at San Francisco General and to be a public health advocate. I want to be able to give back to my community \nby raising awareness about preventive care and other healthcare issues. I'm well on my way to achieving my \n\n\n\ndream. By passing the Dream Act, I will be able to achieve these goals and contribute to the growing healthcare \nindustry.'' Could we use more nurses in this country? We sure could. In fact, the United States imports thousands of \nforeign nurses every year because we have such a large nursing shortage. So why would we consider sending \nSteve Li back? Tolu Olumni: Tolu was brought to the United States from Nigeria when she was a child. As a child, \nTolu dreamed of becoming an engineer. Tolu graduated from high school at the top of her class. She won a full \nscholarship to a prestigious university in Virginia. In 2002, she graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. \nBack in 2011, at a press conference announcing the reintroduction of the Dream Act, here is what Tolu said: ``The \ndreams of my youth have stalled, yes, but my country still needs me. So I volunteer full-time to ensure a better \nfuture for thousands of others. Passing the Dream Act is critically important to me and to so many others. I don't \nbelieve that I am entitled to anything more than what this great Nation has taught me: that we all have a right to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' Imagine. Tolu is right. Thousands of immigrant students in the United States \nwere brought to the United States as children. It was not their decision to come to this country, but they grew up \nhere, and this is their home. The fundamental premise of the Dream Act is that we should not punish children for \ntheir parents' actions. This is not the American way. Instead, the Dream Act says to these students: America will \nalways give you a chance. And I--me--say to their parents: Thank you for bringing these DREAMers to America. \nWe are in your debt for the courage it took for you to take the risk physically, politically, and in every way to do so. \nDavid Cho was brought to the United States from South Korea when he was 9. Since then, David has been a model \nAmerican. He had a 3.9 GPA in high school. He attended UCLA, where he obtained a bachelor of arts in \ninternational finance, with a 3.6 GPA. As you can see, David is also the leader of the UCLA marching band. There \nis a picture of him, but the Record will not reflect that, the leader of the UCLA marching band. David then obtained a \nmaster's degree in public policy, with a GPA of 3.9, and was the UCLA commencement speaker. He worked as a \nbusiness technology analyst at Deloitte Consulting, where he earned the highest possible performance rating, \nrepresenting performance in the top 5 percent of all analysts. Today, David works in business and technology, \nconsulting as a sales force scrum master and project manager. Thank you, David, for your contribution to our \ncountry. Minchul Suk: Minchul was brought to the United States from South Korea by his parents in 1991 when he \nwas 9. I just want to make this point, Mr. Speaker. When I mentioned about Senator Durbin, he introduced the \nDream Act in 2001, it is 17 years later, so some of these children have grown up. But some of them whom we are \naddressing came to the United States in the nineties, and so 17 years later we still haven't been able to take care of \nthe children? They were very little children when they came, and some of them are still young. But they came, some \nof them, as I said, 11 months, 6 months, babies. Minchul came when he was 9. He graduated from high school \nwith a 4.2 GPA. He graduated from UCLA with a degree in microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics. With \nthe support from the Korean-American community, Minchul was able to graduate from dental school. He passed \nthe national boards and license exam and became a dentist. Here is what he wrote: ``After spending the majority of \nmy life here, with all my friends and family here, I could not simply pack my things and go to a country I barely \nremember. I am willing to accept whatever punishment is deemed fitting for that crime; let me just stay and pay for \nit. . . . I am begging for a chance to prove to everyone that I am not a waste of a human being, that I am not a \ncriminal set on leaching off taxpayers' money. Please give me a chance to serve my community as a dentist, to be \na giver rather than a receiver.'' Thank you, Minchul. Senator Durbin has sent over some stories, and I am going to \nread some of them. Jean-Yannick Diouf: When Yannick was 8, his father, a diplomat from the African country of \nSenegal, brought his family to the United States. Unfortunately, Yannick's parents separated and Yannick's father \nreturned to Senegal, leaving Yannick and the rest of the family behind. Yannick did not realize it at the time, but \nwhen his father left the United States, Yannick lost his legal status to live in this country. Yannick grew up in \nMontgomery County, Maryland, nearby. In high school, Yannick was a member of the National Honor Society. He \nalso volunteered weekly at a homeless shelter and organized soccer tournaments for 3 years to raise money for the \nRed Cross for earthquake relief in Haiti. Mind you, he is from Senegal, and he is raising money for earthquake relief \nin Haiti. God bless him. After high school, he continued his education. He earned an associate degree in business \nfrom Montgomery College, where he was on the dean's list. He then transferred to University of Maryland, College \nPark, where he is working on a bachelor's degree in business management. Yannick runs the Achievers Mentoring \nProgram, an after-school program that advises middle school and high school students on how to get into college \nand be successful--very valuable, mentoring. He is also a volunteer for United We Dream, the largest organization \nof undocumented students in the country. May I pause for a moment to commend United We Dream. They have \nbeen so spectacular, so dignified, so prestigious in how they have protected the DREAMers' case and enabled \nDREAMers to present their own case. Yannick was a leader in the campaign to pass the Maryland Dream Act, \n\n\n\n[[Page H934]] which allows Maryland residents who are undocumented to pay instate tuition. Keep in mind, \nYannick is undocumented, so he does not qualify for any official aid from the Federal Government. Here is what \nhe wrote: ``DACA means dignity. More than making money, having a job gives us dignity and self-respect. I want to \nwork for what I have. I don't look to anyone for pity. People should judge me based on what I do and what I stand \nfor, not based on status. I want to be given a chance to prove that not only am I a functioning member of society, I \nam here to serve and share my talents with those in my community.'' Yannick was one of six DREAMers who met \nPresident Obama in the Oval Office. Here is what President Obama said after that meeting: ``I don't think there's \nanybody in America who's had a chance to talk to these six young people . . . who wouldn't find it in their heart to \nsay these kids are Americans just like us, and they belong here, and we want to do right by them.'' President \nObama is right. Yannick and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country. The question again: \nWould America be a stronger country if we deport Yannick and others like him? Of course not. Another DREAMer \nfrom India, this is Harminder Saini. When Harminder was 6 years old, his family moved to the United States from \nIndia. He grew up in Queens in New York City. He was a typical American kid, playing sports and going to the park \nevery day. Harminder's dream was to serve his country as a soldier in the United States Army. In his words, he \nsimply wanted to give back. Harminder was a born leader, and in high school he was active in student government \nand ultimately was elected class president. He first learned that he did not have legal immigration status when he \nwas in high school and was unable to apply for a driver's license, Mr. Speaker. Harminder is now a student at \nHunter College at the City University of New York, working toward his bachelor's degree in history. And thanks to \nDACA, he is on his way to fulfilling his dream. Last year, he enlisted in the Army through the Military Accessions \nVital to the National Interest program, known as MAVNI. The MAVNI program allows immigrants with critical skills \nvital to the national interest to enlist in the Armed Forces. More than 800 DACA recipients with these critical skills \nhave joined the military through MAVNI. Some Trump administration officials have claimed that DACA recipients \nare taking jobs away from Americans, but Harminder and hundreds of other DREAMers have skills that our military \ncouldn't find anywhere else. Harminder, along with many other DREAMers, is now waiting to ship to basic training. \nHe continues his undergraduate studies and is working full-time waiting for his chance to serve the country he \nloves. Harminder wrote: ``All I want to do is serve. I want to do my part to give back to this country because it \nallowed me to serve.'' Without DACA, Harminder and hundreds of other immigrants with skills that are vital to the \nnational interest would be kicked out of the Army. They want nothing more than to serve, and they are willing to die \nfor the country they call home. Thank you, Harminder. Representative Esty of Connecticut sent us this story about \nDaisy Rivera. Her story is in Daisy's own words: ``I came to the United States when I was 2 months old.'' How \nprecious. ``The day I entered high school, my parents broke the sad news to me that I was undocumented. Yes, I \ndid grow up not knowing my true status, and at that very moment I felt I didn't know who exactly I was anymore. It \nmade it very difficult to try and understand when all my siblings were born here in the U.S. and were given \nopportunities that I wasn't able to have. When I graduated high school in 2012, I found out that President Obama \ntook action to grant undocumented people like me the DACA. ``Ever since then, I have been able to feel free, \nsupport my daughter, my parents, and younger siblings still working on their dreams. I now have a beautiful job \nwith a Head Start program for youth development and healthy living. This is a job that not only I enjoy, but my 3-\nyear-old daughter attends as well. DACA has been more than a blessing and a relief for me and my friends and \nfamily. ``But now that it has been put in jeopardy, I can't even go to sleep at night. I look at my daughter thinking: \nWhat can I do so I don't end up like other families that have been separated and destroyed? What can I do to \nsupport my child? How do I explain to my friends and family that my future has been taken away, that I am not like \nthem? ``This might be another challenge for me as an undocumented, but I know that this is just the start of my \nnew beginning that will label me a warrior because I will not sit here and have my future taken. I will not stand by \nthe corners of the streets to ask for anything. I will fight and raise my voice alone or with the other 800,000 \nDREAMers, and we will obtain what we deserve, and we won't give up.'' That story comes from Representative \nEsty. I think it is important to note here that some of these people are, again, working; they are giving back to the \ncommunity. DACA made a big difference in their existence. For some of them, they found out that they were \nundocumented at a critical point in their own development, and it foisted uncertainty upon them, which DACA \nrelieved. So I think there is just a misunderstanding here about what President Trump did in September. It was very \nharsh. As the National Catholic Conference of Bishops said, it was reprehensible. I don't think that the \nadministration understood the impact it had on people's lives. I think they thought they were giving a 6-month \nreprieve, but what they were doing was giving 6 months of uncertainty and removal of protections for these people. \nAnd you have heard some of the statements that have been made in the last day or so about mischaracterizing why \n\n\n\nsome people have lost protections. I will reiterate that this all came fast. Many of the people who needed to sign up \nright away found it difficult to access the $495 immediately. Most people in our country could not have access to \n$495 in the spur of the moment, especially young people. So, anyway, we have always treated this with respect. I \nwould like to talk now about Julia Verzbickis: ``When I was 9, my family and I moved to the United States to find \nsome stability that wasn't present in our home country. We always had plans to make the move permanent, and the \nseemingly endless paperwork process began nearly immediately. However, we didn't know what we were in for. \nThe lawyer we had turned out to be fraudulent, and, as a result, my parents, my sisters, and I lost our status in the \ncountry. It was the summer before my first year of high school. ``The future remained unclear, but I made some \nchoices. I chose to keep my grades up in school. I chose to give myself the opportunity at a future. I worked hard. I \ngraduated 28th in a class of 620. I had a 3.6'' GPA. ``I got into Rutgers early admission. ``The week after my 21st \nbirthday, I got notice that my DACA application had been approved. Within 12 hours, I had applied for a Social \nSecurity card, and, within a week, I'd filled out dozens of job applications. I got a license for the first time ever. ``In \nNovember 2014, I got into Teach For America. I was placed in San Antonio, 1,800 miles away from New Jersey.'' \n{time} 1330 ``I graduated college the following May, cum laude, with a double major in English and journalism. ``In \nAugust 2015, I started teaching. I also met the man that would become the love of my life. I had a new life in a new \nState, and I was all by myself for the first time ever, and I couldn't be more excited. ``I've been teaching middle \nschool since then, and I love it. My kids are amazing. They drive me nuts on any given day, but I love them. \n``DACA gave me my independence back. It's the single reason I am able to teach, and live on my own, and pay for \nmy car, and feel like I belong in the country I have lived in for 15 years. [[Page H935]] ``Knowing that I could lose all \nthe freedom I've gained is a paralyzing fear. I've worked so hard, and my life was just coming together, and now it \nmight fall apart again. I hope that doesn't happen, but if I've learned anything these last 15 years, it's to hope for the \nbest and prepare for the worst.'' That is Julia's story. This is from Zuleyma Garcia. ``Hi, my story started 22 years \nago when I was only 3 years old. My parents, both from Mexico, had crossed over, summer of 1994, through the \nhot and unforgiving desert. I have always admired my parents' drive and courage to go after a better life. I couldn't \nimagine leaving my country, U.S., for one I know nothing about. Which is why I'm so thankful for DACA. ``My mom \nalways showed me anything is possible by working hard for it. I never really noticed or felt like I wasn't American. \nSo my freshman year, after passing my driver's ed, I was very quickly disillusioned by my mother, who explained \nwe were here illegally and could not get a driver's permit. I broke down crying because I felt like my world crumbled. \nSo many thoughts went through my mind, mainly fear at the moment, but I eventually gripped myself together. \nWith the passing years, frustration added to the list of emotions, when I couldn't attend class trips to other States, \napply for scholarships, or even just special programs at colleges, while I was still in high school, because of the \nlack of a Social Security number and an ID. ``Once I graduated and it was time to face the real world, things hit the \nfan. I felt like the doors closed in on me. I had nice internships lined up. I had managed to get into a special \nprogram at my college, which I wasn't able to do because of my status. A year into working a minimum wage job \nand attending college for a preschool teacher, I now felt like I had been torn apart, felt like no matter how hard I \nworked, I would never accomplish my goals because of this barrier. So I dropped out of college and just focused on \nworking, got a second job, and moved out of my mom's home. Soon after, I met my husband of 5 years now, which \nis an American citizen; we have a 5-year-old child. ``DACA allowed me to feel like a human again and to live \nwithout fear. I'm not a bad person. I have a clean criminal record and am a good member of society, and, like me, \nthere's so many. This is why I call for an extension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.'' Again, the \nuncertainty, the anxiety, that is injected into people's lives. I thank them for sharing these deep concerns. We are \nnow hearing from Isabelle Muhlbauer. ``By junior year of high school, I spoke English fluently and attended all \nhonors classes, but, unlike most 15 year olds, my future was uncertain due to my immigration status. It was this \nuncertainty that led to my interest in American politics. I wanted to understand why I was not eligible to apply for \ncertain schools, scholarships, and financial aid despite being a top student at my high school. ``There seemed to \nbe something fundamentally unfair about a system that excluded students like me. However frustrating my situation \nwas, I was fortunate to live in New York, where residency laws made the possibility of attending college a reality. \n``At Baruch College, I studied political science. I attended school full time and, by sophomore year, had the \nopportunity to intern at Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's office at the Veterans' Affairs casework department. I knew then \nthat I wanted to pursue public service, but was well aware of the legal hurdles ahead of me due to my \nundocumented status. ``I was unsure what life after graduation would be like without authorization to work. \nThankfully, the DACA program was announced a few semesters before my graduation. Although it was still difficult \nto find the right job, my persistence eventually led me to the New York Legal Assistance Group. I now work as a \n\n\n\nparalegal in the Veterans Assistance Project at NYLAG. I have the opportunity to work with a team that is \ncommitted to helping the low-income veteran population in NYC get access to the benefits they earned through \ntheir service.'' A DACA--a DREAMer--helping our veterans. ``I had hoped to attend law school to further advance \nmy career in public interest law, but given the current uncertainty of what will happen with DACA, it's become \nincreasingly difficult to plan for the future. While DACA is not the solution to the current state of immigration affairs, \nit has given me and over 700,000 other DREAMers the path to achieving the American Dream.'' We thank Isabelle \nfor sharing her story. This is from Bruna. ``There are a few minutes left of President Obama's Presidency and a \nfeeling of dread fills me. Not only because I'm saying goodbye to a President that has meant so much to me and \nthousands of DREAMers, but because within a few minutes the new President may choose to remove DACA--\ntaking away a sense of security we've had these past years. ``In 2012, President Obama presented DACA, giving \nme and my sister another chance at life. Before then, we did truly feel like we were going to lose everything: friends \nand family we made in this country, the home we built, and the future we envisioned. ``Born in Brazil, but raised in \nTampa, Florida, my parents always pushed us to excel in school, in leadership positions, and in sports. We \nplanned to go to college, travel the world, volunteer, and to make a difference in a country that had generously \nwelcomed us. ``After a third failed attempt at securing a green card, we had given up. My parents had done \neverything they could. They paid the expensive lawyer fees, opened a small business, and had secured and \nrenewed work visas throughout our time here. There was no explanation as to why U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services would deny legal immigrants with a business, a home, savings accounts, and a decade in \nthe country, a chance at becoming permanent residents. ``With the threat of being deported looming over my head, \nI did everything I could to help reelect President Obama. I joined OFA in Gainesville, Florida, and spent countless \nnights with volunteers and staffers.'' ``So although I am scared of what comes next, if we lose DACA, if we're no \nlonger able to continue working in the U.S., I am empowered by an important lesson President Obama taught us: \nWe are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek. In this time of uncertainty, we must carry \nthat lesson and fight so that all people, including DREAMers, can continue working towards the American Dream.'' I \nknow that Representative Jayapal is on the floor, and I wish that she could deliver it herself, but the rules do not \nallow. Parliamentary Inquiry Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. \nSimpson). The gentlewoman will state her parliamentary inquiry. Ms. PELOSI. Are we going to be able to have \nSpecial Orders for our colleagues at the end of the session? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman may \nconsult with leadership on matters of scheduling. Ms. PELOSI. Okay. I didn't know if a decision had been made \nabout that yet. Then I will continue to read. Amy Kele. This is from Representative Jayapal, a leader on the \nimmigration issues, as you probably all know, an immigrant herself to our country, and now a Member of \nCongress. I am so proud of her. Amy Kele and her family moved from Fiji to settle in Everett, Washington, staying \non their father's student visa. Things change when Amy's parents left the U.S. to attend a wedding in Fiji. ``They \nwere only planning to stay for 2 weeks, but then my mom's visa got denied,'' said Amy, the oldest of four children. \nAmy is now 19, but the last time she saw her parents was when she was just 11 years old. How sad. When Amy's \nparents left for Fiji, Amy's grandmother came from California to babysit. When they weren't able to reenter the \ncountry, she picked up her life and moved to Everett to care for her grandchildren. ``She's the heart of this whole \nfamily. She's kept us together this whole time. I don't know where we'd be right now, maybe back in Fiji or in a \nfoster home. I'm really thankful for her in our lives,'' said Kele. Though Amy's grandmother has been living in the \nU.S. for almost 20 years, she is also undocumented. ``Because she's also undocumented, she can't get benefits \nlike Social Security and things like that. It kind of breaks my heart whenever I think about it.'' [[Page H936]] With the \nexception of Amy's younger sister, who was born in the United States, the Kele children have all enrolled in DACA. \nAmy is now a nursing student and healthcare worker for the elderly. As the oldest sibling, she takes pride in being \nable to help her grandmother support their family. She provides for her three siblings, is an active member of her \nchurch, and is looked to as a leader at the University of Washington. Amy is shy, full of heart, and cares deeply \nabout her family and community. Without the support of DACA, Amy fears never being able to complete her nursing \ndegree. Without a work permit, the livelihood of their family is at stake. The risk of deportation means she could be \nseparated from her family, possibly leaving her youngest sister in foster care. What? This is a very sad and \nchallenging situation. So many families affected that just being able to vote on the floor could correct. It is about the \nchildren. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for sharing that story with us. Whip Hoyer wanted to tell this \nstory on the floor himself, and other stories as well, but the rules at the moment do not allow him. We are uncertain \nas to whether there will be an opportunity for Special Orders where Members can speak afterward. Lisia Vala, \nIndian American, her personal story. Mr. Speaker, I thank Whip Hoyer for his leadership. Whip Hoyer has been so \n\n\n\nmuch a champion on this issue, fighting so hard in every possible venue, under any auspices, there every step of \nthe way. He submits this story. My family moved from Canada to San Antonio in 1996 when I was 6. Mr. Speaker, \nthis is a DREAMer from Canada. We had a visa, and my parents worked to change our immigration status for as \nlong as I can remember. We spent decades playing by the rules. But one time our immigration attorney filed our \npaperwork late, and another time our sponsor sold his business, forcing us to restart the entire application process. \nFor more than 20 years, we attempted to navigate the broken immigration system, an emotionally exhausting and \nfinancially draining process. Suffice it to say that I am not undocumented for lack of trying. Growing up in Texas, I \nalways felt like an American because, in every possible way, I was. I went to elementary, middle, and high school \nin San Antonio, enrolling in Girl Scouts, and spending my summers playing league basketball. I volunteered at the \nlocal food bank, took far too many AP classes, and worked behind the cash register at the neighborhood grocery \nstore. In 2008, I left for college. Four years later, I graduated, and, thanks to DACA, I was suddenly eligible for relief \nfrom immigration worries. DACA has helped me become the person I am today. Because of my work permit, I have \nbeen able to buy a home, a car, and pay off my student loans. I launched a small business helping U.S. citizens \nwith their resume so they can get jobs. I have a meaningful job and pay State and Federal taxes, I pay rent to live in \nmy apartment in Washington, I eat at restaurants, shop at local stores, and pay for public transportation. All the \ndollars that I have spent, and the dollars that 800,000 people like me spent, are reinvested back in the community \nand help improve the lives of our American citizen neighbors and friends. A beautiful story from Lisia, and, again, \nthere is nothing lazy about this family, or any of these families, as to how they want to achieve legal status in our \ncountry. The only violation in hundreds of thousands of these cases is a status, either a lapse, in this case, or a \nviolation, but nothing in terms of breaking the law in any other way. {time} 1345 From California, Congressman \nJimmy Panetta, a member of our freshman class, tells us the story of Adriana from Salinas. I thank Jimmy for the \nwork he tried to do with the group that he works with in a bipartisan way to advance the cause of the DREAMers. \nAdriana tells this story: ``At the age of 7, I migrated to the place that I now call home. I came with the dream of \npursuing an education and becoming someone important, someone who would give back to the community. I am \nworking to achieve my dream. To my community, I am a student, I am a peer, I am a leader. To the Trump \nadministration, I am a criminal. I stood in the shadows for a very long time, and education was always my outlet. I \ngrew to be the person I am today because of my mother, a cook, who told me that education was the most \nimportant thing I could earn. ``People tell me to go back to my country, but people do not realize that this is my \ncountry. I work, I pay taxes, I go to school, I stand for the national anthem, and I know the Pledge of Allegiance. \nThis country has seen me grow, and this country has contributed to my dreams. I aspire to attend law school. \nDACA has helped me achieve my dreams. I was able to get a Social Security card. I was allowed to apply for a \ndriver's license. DACA allowed me to be like any other person my age. ``People have asked me what would I do \nwithout DACA. To be honest, I have faith in my elected officials. I do not want everything handed to me, nor do I \nbelieve that I deserve everything. What I do ask for is the ability to be like any other 25-year-old in this country. I \ndon't want the termination of DACA to be the termination of my dreams.'' Thank you, Adriana. Thank you, Jimmy \nPanetta, for submitting that story. Juan Escalante tells us that he was working at an unpaid internship in 2012 when \nhe caught word of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, announcement via Twitter. He said: ``I ran to \nthe office lobby, turned on the TV, and immediately knew right away that life would not be the same. I called my \nmother in tears and proceeded to tell her that my brothers and I would be able to benefit from a program that would \ntemporarily shield us from deportation, while allowing us to work and drive legally. I understood DACA was a \ntemporary program that would not cover parents, but it renewed my commitment to fight for relief for the rest of the \nimmigrant community. ``Since that day, I have taken every opportunity to grow, learn, and contribute back to my \ncommunity. In 2013, DACA allowed me to re-enroll in Florida State University and pursue a master's degree in \npublic administration. By 2014, I was in the middle of working a job in Tallahassee, Florida, studying for my master's \nclasses, and advocating at the Florida Legislature for a bill that would allow undocumented students to obtain \ninstate tuition at State colleges and universities. In a rare display of bipartisanship, the bill passed and was signed \ninto law by Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott. ``I graduated with my master's in 2015 full of hope and energy \nthat I would be able to put my education to good use. With degrees in hand, I was able to obtain a job as a digital \nimmigration advocate, putting my years of experience and passion to good use. Simultaneously, and thanks to the \nnew instate tuition law in Florida, I was able to help both of my younger brothers enroll at Miami Dade College and \nFlorida International University. They are currently pursuing degrees to work in business and communications, \nrespectively.'' I just want to say that I have spoken at the graduation at Miami Dade College and spoken also at \nFlorida International University, two magnificent schools. And what is beautiful about them is to see the beautiful \n\n\n\ndiversity in the large number of students that they teach, and the many cases of first children to attend college, but \nwith all the optimism, dignity, and hope that you could ever imagine. They are two great institutions. I actually spoke \nat the commencement address one year, the year before President Bush spoke there. I have said earlier, President \nBush was a wonderful President dedicated to recognizing how important immigration was to our country and how \nwe should value our immigrants and treat them with respect when we have the debate on these issues. Juan goes \non to say: ``There are a lot of misconceptions regarding the DACA program, but perhaps the biggest one is that \nbeneficiaries of the program are asking for a free pass. DACA does not grant citizenship. Rather, it allows \nindividuals like myself, who have benefitted from State-funded investments like public education, to move forward \nwith their lives and continue to contribute to their communities. That means DACA beneficiaries could continue to \npursue higher education, starting businesses, or putting their skills to use without the constant fear of deportation if \nthe program is kept in place.'' Of course, we hope the Dream Act will have a more beneficial impact than just the \nDACA announcement, but that is what we are asking the Speaker for a vote for. We thank Juan for sharing his \nimportant story and reinforcing the constant message that people are working hard [[Page H937]] and they want to \ngive back to the community; the immigrant commitment and recognition that education is the source of making the \nfuture better for their families and for our country. Denis Montero Diaz tells his story: ``I didn't cry. I knew it was for \nthe best. I said good-bye to many: the people I love. I felt uncertainty, yet I didn't cry. ``You see, I knew of the \nAmerican Dream. Every evening I'd watch American films filled with white picket fences and big city aspirations. I \ndreamed of setting foot in the land of opportunity. ``After a disastrous journey, we arrived home. Every morning I \npledged allegiance to the flag. I meant it. I excelled in school. That is why our parents worked so hard, why we \nrisked so much; opportunities that come through education and hard work.'' Again, that immigrant ethic of hard \nwork ethic and education ethic. Denis says: ``Later, I learned what my undocumented status truly meant. I felt \nuncertainty, shame, no future. Rattled by depression, I contemplated giving up. ``Luckily, I had educators that told \nme I was wasting a mind. So I've continued to pursue my education and help run our family business. ``Through \nDACA, me and 800,000 others live freely. We can contribute. That's our American Dream. That is why my mother \nworks so hard, hands aching, yet a kind smile on her face. That's why I study economics, to one day enthrall my \nmind to the betterment of this Nation.'' Giving back. Denis says: ``I watched Trump make his way to the podium. I \nfelt uncertainty. My own need for an answer was channeled through the screen into the mind of a reporter who \nasked about DACA. No answer. Silence. ``The 45th President took office. Cannons fired, people applauded, rain \nfell. But I do not believe in omens. If the life of 800,000 `DACAmented' Americans is altered, it will not be by virtue \nof the rain. It will be by the lightning strike of one man's hand. ``We ask only to let us contribute freely. Let us walk \nalong you, shoulder to shoulder, on that same road our hands helped to pave. Human decency and morality \ndemand it. The American people, our people, demand it.'' So we thank Denis for sharing his story. You hear, Mr. \nSpeaker, reiterated time and again, the work ethic, family values, education, giving back to America, no free ride. I \nhave mentioned the Congressional Black Caucus and their leadership on this issue; the Hispanic Caucus and their \nleadership. I am very, very proud of CAPAC. I represent a district that, as they say in San Francisco, the beauty is \nin the mix; and one-third of my district is Asian-Pacific American, so I take a great pride in being part of the CAPAC, \nthe Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. So here are the statistics that they have given us: Twenty \npercent of DACA recipients are Asian-Pacific Islanders. Did Members know that? More than 130,000 Asian-Pacific \nIslander DREAMers. And 7,000 DREAMers are from South Korea. Nearly 5,000 DREAMers are from the \nPhilippines. More than 3,000 DREAMers are from India. Nearly 2,000 DREAMers are from Pakistan. And \nthousands more are from the rest of the Asian-Pacific area. In addition to DACA, though, there are many people \nfrom the Asian- Pacific area who would be benefited if we did comprehensive immigration reform. Today we are just \nspeaking about the DREAMers. So I thank Congresswoman Judy Chu for her persistent, relentless leadership on \nthis subject as the chair of CAPAC--the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus--and also her insistence in \npresenting the value of family unification as a value, as a source of strength to America. This is an important debate \nthat will be part of whatever comes next in legislation. But I thank her for her leadership in that regard. An icon in \nthe Congress, John Lewis from Georgia, has submitted this testimony. John has spoken so beautifully on this \nsubject. I think if anyone listened to him, if the DREAMers heard him, they would feel so comforted, inspired, and \noptimistic. If others heard him, if their hearts are open, they would have to say we must get a result, we must do the \nright thing. John always inspires us in that way. What an honor it is for all of us to serve with him, to call him our \ncolleague. John submitted this story from a Georgian. This is a Georgian's statement: ``Last week, on January 30, \n2018, President Trump, in his State of the Union, said, `Americans are DREAMers, too.' He didn't mention the \nsecond part: DREAMers are American, too. ``My name is Daniela, and I was there at the State of the Union last \n\n\n\nweek when I heard President Trump say these words.'' Daniela is a Georgian, as John Lewis has indicated. Daniela \ngoes on to say: ``I was brought over at age 4 because my mother realized that, if we stayed, we wouldn't survive.'' \nShe is from Acapulco, Mexico. Daniela says: ``And at the time, there were very limited ways to get into the U.S. \nlegally. It required a lot of money and time, something we didn't have. ``Put yourself in her shoes. What would you \nhave done for you and your child? ``Wait years in a country that wasn't safe, for the hope that someday maybe you \ncould come to America. A someday that never came for some because death came knocking first.'' Death by \nviolence. Daniela says: ``My mother did what any good parent would do in that situation. She decided to risk her \nlife so that her child could have a future. ``I am currently a student down the street at George Washington \nUniversity. I grew up in Georgia. I speak English more fluently than I do Spanish. America is home. I am an \nAmerican. I am currently studying political science, and aspire to work for the United Nations as an advocate for \nhuman rights. I earned over $30,000 in private scholarship money to attend college.'' She worked and did that. \nDaniela says: ``Nothing was handed to me. I did not qualify for instate tuition or any type of Federal financial aid. \n``They call us DREAMers, but we are actually working every day to make our dreams into a reality. It's cruel to deny \nme and the 800,000- plus DREAMers a clean Dream Act. The impact of losing DACA would be devastating not just \nemotionally and personally, but also detrimental to the economy. DREAMers are going to school, opening up \nbusinesses, working, paying taxes.'' I would add, serving in our military. Daniela says: ``A study by the Center for \nAmerican Progress estimated that the loss of all DACA workers would reduce U.S. gross domestic product by $433 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Yes, $433 billion.'' Mr. Speaker, that is over the next 10 years. Daniela says: \n``Removing the DREAMers is not only unethical and unjust, it's also simply un-American because of the damage it \nwould do to the economy. ``You gave an oath to protect the interests of the American people. I am an American. \nThis is not a partisan issue. Please choose to be on the right side of history.'' I thank John Lewis for submitting this \nbeautiful statement. I also thank this Georgian for her testimony. I just want to say to Daniela that not only would we \nbe--you ask us to be on the right side of history. I would say that, in this Congress and in this country, we not only \nwant to be on the right side of history, we want to be on the right side of the future. And to be on the right side of the \nfuture, we have to recognize who we are as a country, what our values are. Imagine Founders who would say it is \nour national purpose and what we owe people is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The pursuit of happiness \nis one of the goals of our Nation, one of the standards of what we stand for, to use the word again. This is not just \nabout protecting the economy. It is about protecting our country, who we are as a country. So I thank John Lewis, \nand I thank Daniela for her impressive, impressive presentation. {time} 1400 Brisa E. Ramirez's statement says: ``I \nwas born in . . . Mexico. I am 26 years old, and I have lived in the United States as an undocumented immigrant \nfor 25 years.'' [[Page H938]] Do the math, Mr. Speaker. That means Brias came at 1 year old. ``Throughout my \nchildhood, I did not fully understand the repercussions that came from hearing the status of `illegal' in this country, \nbut I did know my mother and I had to be `careful.' As an adult, I am now experiencing firsthand the restrictions, \nprejudice, and fear illegal immigrants must confront. Since childhood, I have always wanted to make a tangible \ndifference in the world.'' Listen to that sentence. ``Since childhood, I have always wanted to make a tangible \ndifference in the world.'' ``Growing up in adversity inspired me to obtain a college degree; I wanted to become \nsomeone who could right the wrongs experienced by those living in poverty. ``In 2012, when I first heard about \nDACA, I was skeptical. The idea of self-disclosing my immigration status, especially to the government, was \nterrifying. I waited 2 years to see what would become of those who bravely stepped out in order to receive their 2 \nyears of deferment from deportation. Eventually, I had to do the same. I understood that I could continue to be \n`safe' in the shadows but live as a criminal or expose myself and live as a law-abiding individual. Even though I feel \nlike I have an expiration date, I am much happier thanks to DACA. ``DACA has given me the ability to drive without \nfear, work legally without fear, and earn jobs where I am not exploited. DACA has given me the ability to use my \ncollege degree, which I earned through private donations in the form of a full-tuition scholarship through years of \nhard work, perseverance, and many, many tears. DACA has given me the ability to earn a position as an \nAmeriCorps VISTA and serve in the fight against poverty in Boston. . . . It's amazing how nine digits and a flimsy \npiece of discolored paper can change your life. ``My dream is to create a more compassionate society that restores \nhuman dignity to those who are pushed further into the margins. I want to earn my Ph.D. I want to become a leader \nof an organization that seeks to provide opportunities that do not trap people in misery and dependence. I want to \nbe a voice for the voiceless. My dream is to discover potential in people who are thought to have none because I \nknow what it is like.'' Thank you, Brisa, for your courage. Giovanni writes: ``I left Panama on my eighth birthday on a \nflight bound for Los Angeles, California. At the time, I didn't fully understand the weight of what was happening. I \nwas excited to have the people on my flight sing ``Happy Birthday'' to me. I was intrigued by the smoked salmon \n\n\n\nthat the stewardess served me for lunch. I had no idea that to this day, almost 20 years later, I would not return to \nmy hometown or my childhood friends or the house that I was born in. ``From the moment I arrived in the United \nStates, I tried my hardest to fit in. I learned English quickly and dropped my Spanish accent. I tried to excel in my \nstudies, even though this prompted comments that I was `acting White.' I made friends, consumed popular culture, \nplayed video games. I assimilated well because of that immense pressure known only to those who leave their \nhomes for the land of opportunity. I looked at other immigrant kids with their broken English and hand-me- down \nclothes and the way they were being teased. I wanted, and often failed, to distance myself from the perception that I \ndid not belong. ``The older I got, the more I realized that my situation wasn't going to get any better,'' Giovanni \nwrites on. `` `Close' friends criticized and spewed toxic mistruths about immigrants and how they were ruining this \ncountry. I lived under the constant fear that my home would be raided or that my parents would get arrested and \nsent to a detention center. I became better and better at coming up with excuses for why I had no license, no car, \nno job, why I couldn't travel or take advantage of scholarships, why I turned down internship opportunities and \nresearch positions with my professors. ``At the risk of sounding cliche, DACA opened doors for me. It goes well \nbeyond just being able to work and get a license and fly domestically. You see, what all of us want is simple. We \njust want the opportunity to emerge from the shadows, to work and support our families, to contribute back to our \ncommunities, to love our partners/ spouses without the fear of being deported at a moment's notice. We have that \nnow. But for how long?'' We thank Giovanni for his message, but again, fear, tears. As I said, the Statue of Liberty \nmust have tears in her eyes when she hears some of the comments that are made about immigrants, fear in the \nhearts of some of these people. Giovanni talks about doors opening, saying it is like a cliche, but DACA opened \ndoors for him. Let's hope that passing the Dream Act will keep those doors open. Deyanira writes this: `` `Adversity \ncauses some men to break; others to break records'--William Arthur Ward. ``Although being undocumented has \nbeen my toughest struggle here in the United States,'' Deyanira writes, ``it has shaped me to highly appreciate \neducation and encourage my younger siblings to excel in their studies in order to pursue a career. ``I was born in \nSan Luis Potosi, Mexico. My parents decided early on that they wanted their children to grow up in better \nenvironments than the ones they grew up in. They migrated to the United States of America when I was very young \nso that they could work endlessly and send money back home to Mexico. At the age of 5, I migrated along with my \nsister. I was excited about my family being united once again, despite the adversity we face. ``The hardships range \nfrom medical situations to owning a driver's license. The cost of visiting a clinic is tremendously overwhelming due \nto the fact that we did not have the documents required for a medical insurance plan. My parents, like many others \nthroughout the U.S., risk so much by pursuing the American Dream every day. ``On August 12, President Obama \nintroduced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. My sister and I applied and we received our work \npermits. My soul was euphoric with the joy of being legal in this country, but then I discovered this valuable permit \nwould only help me work legally but would not grant me permanent residence. ``I qualified for scholarships like the \nGates Millennium Scholarship, but I would not even be considered because of my status. I looked high and low for \nany scholarship that would accept undocumented students and made sure to apply because they were few and far \nbetween. Regardless of not being a permanent resident or citizen, I still made my dream of attending the University \nof Texas''--Austin, Texas--``majoring in neuroscience a reality. ``I consider myself blessed and hope that others can \nlearn from my struggles. I am involved in UT University Leadership Initiative, an organization that advocates for \nimmigrant rights and helps the community fight injustices. Despite DACA only allowing temporary relief to me, I \nappreciate it because it removed the burden of my status from me and allowed me to work and contribute to \nsociety. If DACA were removed, we would have to return to the shadows and live life in constant fear.'' We cannot \nlet that happen. Another student from Georgia, this time McDonough, Georgia, Anayancy Ramos, writes: ``I learned \nto live as an American before the memories of my homeland solidified into a permanent impression. My mother \ntongue was forgotten as I learned to speak English, weakening the profound virtuosity of my heritage and reshaping \nmy family's mannerisms and grandiose personalities. In pursuing the American Dream, my parents not only offered \ntheir lives, but also their youngest daughter. ``In spite of losing my ancestors that both defined me and were \nunknown to me, I have fought for the new self I have built up from the ashes of the broken dreams they tried to burn \ndown. While in community college, I steadfastly held the distinction of a dean's list scholar and successfully \ncompleted the requirements for earning an honors certificate by completing eight honors courses. I held the merit of \nbeing inducted into an honors society, Phi Theta Kappa, and was appointed president of the Alpha Beta Gamma \nchapter the following year, all the while working full-time at an animal hospital. ``I poured the desperation I felt over \nbeing denied my education at the top research schools in Georgia into my school and work. I rose to the position \nof manager at the animal hospital and [[Page H939]] was the sole student awarded the distinction of Student of the \n\n\n\nYear in Biology out of the total college population of 21,000 students''--top student, 21,000 students. ``In an attempt \nto continue my education further than a 2-year associate's degree, I was chosen from a pool of thousands as a \nsemifinalist for the prestigious Jack Kent Cooke scholarship. Later that year, I was offered a different private \nscholarship to attend Eastern Connecticut State University at no cost to me. In another 2 years' time, I will graduate \nwith a double major in biochemistry and biology. ``Four years was all it took for me to effectively and irrevocably \npursue the education I have proved that I deserve. However, these dreams have an expiration date. Every 2 years, \nI must go through the taxing process of applying for DACA. Every 2 years, these dreams may die. Until then, I \nbreathe the heart and soul of my denied ancestors into my studies to keep them alive and to keep them ingrained in \nmy pursuit of the American Dream.'' So beautiful. Thank you, Anayancy. And then I want to talk about Cindy: ``My \nname is Cindy Nava. I was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and arrived in the United States in 1997. I have been \nblessed to grow up in a State that has demonstrated its appreciation and support to immigrant communities over \nthe years. The State of New Mexico is not only the place I call home, but it is the State that has nourished my deep \nlove and passion for civic engagement and policy. ``I began my college life at Santa Fe Community College and \nthen transferred to the University of New Mexico, where I obtained a BA degree in political science in 2014. I did not \nobtain DACA until spring 2016 due to a local attorney who advised me not to apply. However, this did not stop me \nfrom continuing my education. I served as an intern and fellow for more than a dozen State and national political \norganizations, regardless of the fact that they could not hire me. ``I collaborated with organizations to register high \nschool students to vote, while still not being able to cast a vote myself. I interned at my State legislature for 6 years \nand went on to become the first undocumented student to serve as an intern . . . through my selection for the Rilla \nMoran NFDW Award. ``Thanks to DACA, I was able to begin a graduate program and thus was able to accept a job \nas a graduate research assistant at the University of New Mexico. Having the ability to travel to border States \ngranted me the ability to become the second DREAMer in the country to graduate from the EMERGE America \nwomen leaders training program.'' Wow. ``DACA has changed my life, and I will always be grateful to President \nObama for taking the first step to uplift our immigrant communities through his efforts to support us, regardless of \nthe criticisms he received. ``DACA will forever hold a special place in my heart, as it is through the benefit of being \nable to apply for advanced parole that I was able to travel to Chihuahua, Mexico, after 21 years to be with my \nbeloved llalla Eva--grandmother--until her very last moments on this Earth. ``I will forever cherish the fact that \nDACA opened a world of opportunities for me to support my family and communities in ways I would have never \nable to do otherwise.'' Thank you, Cindy Nava, for sharing your personal story with us. Here on the floor, \nRepresentative Blunt Rochester from Delaware, I thank her for being with us. A member of the freshman class, \nRepresentative Blunt Rochester was effective from the start and into advocacy for our DACAs from day one, and I \nthank her for giving us this story of Indira Islas. Her story says: ``I was born in Guerrero, Mexico, and I came to the \nU.S. with my parents at the age of 6. I am a 19-year-old DACA student currently studying biology. ``September 16, \n2013, seemed just like any day. I was on my way home from school when my bus came across heavy traffic just a \nfew miles from my stop. As it inched forward and approached the turn that led to my house, flashing lights and the \nscene of an accident came into view. When we saw that an ambulance was blocking the intersection, we all stood \nup eagerly from our seats--intrigued, fascinated, and curious to see what happened. In the distance beyond the \ncomfort of my seat, my heart dropped as I recognized what was unmistakably my dad's crushed car. ``After arriving \nin the emergency room, I was told to have a seat in the waiting area. As I sat down, so many things went through \nmy mind before I was finally allowed to see him. A nurse with a clipboard escorted me back, and I held my breath \nas she opened the curtain to his room. There was my dad, handcuffed to his hospital bed and looking utterly \ndefeated.'' {time} 1415 ``After a long embrace, he finally spoke. In his voice, he carried fear of the unknown and \nuncertainty of the future; he knew of the adversity ahead of us. Though his words were few, he began telling me \nthat I was going to have to be strong and to not lose focus of my education. He was then taken to jail. ``From that \nday on, I knew that my life would be different. In the midst of all of this, I found refuge in the one thing that I had \ncontrol over: my education. If I were to have lost my dad that day, September 16, I know he would not have been \ndisappointed because he would have been content knowing that his children are going to be left in a good place--\nwhich is all an immigrant parent ever wants. ``At that moment, the flames of disparity gave way to the fire of \nindignation, but this conflagration only kindled within me a phoenix of preservation: I would persevere in spite of \nthese obstacles. I spent countless hours researching every possible opportunity that would allow me to further my \neducation. ``Lastly, I would like to encourage you to think of the thousands of undocumented people like myself. I \nstand before you to ask you to pass the Dream Act so I and many other undocumented people not only can \ncontinue pursuing the American Dream, but also no longer fear being separated from our loved ones.'' I thank \n\n\n\nCongresswoman Blunt Rochester for this beautifully written, almost poetic statement. Like so many other DACA \nstudents and DREAMers, it is a story of family, of education, of commitment, of patriotism-- also beautifully written. I \nknow that in the course of the day, we have been joined by Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, who has been a real \nchampion on the issue of immigration and a champion, relentlessly, for our DREAMers. She has served as the chair \nof the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee. She is now the ranking Democrat on the Immigration and \nBorder Security Subcommittee. She has practiced immigration law. She has taught immigration law. She is a \nrecognized leader, called upon by all kinds of constitutional institutions for her views on this and other subjects that \nrelate to our Constitution and our country. She is relentless to satisfy and persistent. She is not only a leader, but \nalso a strong advocate. I thank the Congresswoman for her leadership. I mentioned earlier Congresswoman Sheila \nJackson Lee. Also, when I mentioned the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee that Congresswoman \nZoe Lofgren serves on, that is a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee of which she is a leader. \nCongresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, also a member of the Judiciary Committee, a leader on the immigration issue \nand expert on it, earlier I read her statement that she presented from a DREAMer from Houston, Texas. I thank the \nCongresswoman for being with us. Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman from New Jersey is with us, too, and \nshe is a very outspoken force on many subjects in the Congress. As you see, we had many testimonies from New \nJersey, and I know she knows this issue so well. But for all of us, it is not just an issue. It is a value. It is something \nvery important to us. Earlier, also from New Jersey, was Frank Pallone, our ranking member on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, who cares so deeply about this issue. He has been in and out for most of the 4 hours that I \nhave been speaking. [[Page H940]] John Lewis, we had his beautiful statement from a DREAMer, Daniela, a \ndreamer from Georgia. I thank the gentleman for his great leadership. I sang his praises earlier. I could spend \nanother 4 hours just talking about the gentleman. I thank him so much. Congresswoman Maxine Waters has been \nhere for most of the time. She, too, as a Californian, understands the impact of public policy on the lives of people. \nAs Dr. King told us, the ballot, legislation, your life, there is a direct relationship. Legislation here has a direct impact \non the lives of these people, and nobody understands that better than Maxine Waters, our ranking member on the \nFinancial Services Committee. I commend her for her leadership on the part of the American taxpayer as well as \nconsumer. Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez was also here earlier, a leader on the committee, the Financial \nServices Committee, also a leader, the Democratic leader on the Small Business Committee where many, many \nminority-owned businesses enjoy the benefit of her leadership. She also was the chairman of the Hispanic Caucus \nthe year that we passed the DREAM Act in the House of Representatives. I thank her and the members of the \ncommittee for making that victory possible then. Congresswoman Anna Eshoo of California, she has been a \ntremendous force on this issue. A number of the testimonies that I have read have been either from the Silicon \nValley area or aspire to be from the Silicon Valley area. There are a lot of entrepreneurship, STEM, and engineer \naspirations in this list, so we thank Congresswoman Eshoo for her role as a leader on the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee and for her strong advocacy for many. She and Zoe Lofgren know better than almost anyone the \ncontributions that immigrants have made. Most of the new startup companies in our area are started by \nimmigrants to our country. Many of the people who would like to be part of that are part of the DREAMer \ncommunity. So we thank Congresswoman Eshoo also for her extraordinary leadership. I am going to go on to \nAlejandra Gonzalez. The story goes like this, Mr. Speaker: ``I was 12 years old when I found out I was \nundocumented and when I found out I couldn't be a teacher like I've always wanted to because, without the proper \ndocumentation, I couldn't receive grants and loans to afford a higher education. I had to settle for jobs that didn't \nallow me to use my full potential because I didn't have a Social Security number, and it was then that I started to \nlive a life full of anxiety, stress, and depression because of the uncertainty of my future and the threat of \ndeportation. DACA was an instant relief from that.'' Alejandra goes on to say: ``Since DACA, I have been able to \nacquire the funds to go back to school. While some had seen DACA as a form of amnesty''--no--``and have pledge \nto fight against it, it should be stated that it is far from that. If anything, it is a Band-Aid solution of addressing the \nneeds and concerns of the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country. ``My plan after graduating from \nAlverno College consists of making healthcare accessible to all and giving back to the community that I love so \nmuch. There are DREAMers that have become lawyers, doctors, police officers, and small-business owners thanks \nto DACA, and their career choices benefit the country as a whole. ``We are a group of hardworking individuals who \njust want the opportunity at a better life. My parents' choice to smuggle me across the border was irresponsible,'' \nAlejandra says, ``but I understand why they did it. Our home country is being terrorized by poverty and drug cartels, \nand I can't imagine what my life would have been like if we would have stayed. I am grateful for all the privileges the \nUnited States has granted me, and while DACA is just a temporary fix to immigration policy, it is one that provides a \n\n\n\npathway to success for millions of DREAMers in the country. ``If we are to lose DACA, I hope that the new \nadministration implements a reform that assures the well-being of DREAMers--but if it doesn't, I know that our will to \nkeep fighting and progressing won't end. With or without DACA, my future doesn't feel uncertain anymore. I will \ncontinue to pursue my goal of making healthcare accessible. ``We aren't asking for a handout. We are asking for \nthe same opportunities to succeed in the country we call home.'' Thank you, Alejandra. Miriam Santamaria writes: `` \n`Don't worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition.' '' Who said that? Abraham \nLincoln. `` `Don't worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition.'--Abraham Lincoln.'' \nMiriam writes: ``I have carried Lincoln's advice throughout my life. It resonates with me now more than ever. ``I was \n4 years old when I was brought to this country. After my father passed away, my mother was faced with the difficult \ntask of raising two children on her own. It was then that she made the decision to come to the United States. \nLeaving all of her comforts behind, she sacrificed everything to pursue a better life for us. I have lived in this country \never since. It was in Houston, Texas, where I went to school, learned a second language, graduated from high \nschool with honors, and paid my way through community college. ``I grew up with a vision of achieving the \n`American Dream,' the same `dream' they teach you in school, the dream that anyone with honest character and \nconduct can succeed in this country. Yet none of that matters if you do not have the `right' identity card. ``Because \nof DACA, I was able to apply for and obtain a work permit and driver's license. DACA also gave me the opportunity \nto live out my dreams. I am now a manager at a construction company and own my own photography business. I \nplan to continue pursuing my aspirations regardless of my status. ``I consider myself lucky among others who were \ndenied the rights granted by DACA. That is why I decided to share my story. I am not looking for any kind of \nrecognition or sympathy, but looking to make a difference and inspire others. Hopefully, the Trump administration \ntakes into consideration all of our stories when they make a decision about the future. In the meantime, we, the \nDREAMers, need to continue to set a high example for others and give back to our communities which have given \nus so much, even while political forces threaten our daily lives. ``I know my story is one of many others and that I \nspeak for them when I say we are not asking for handouts, only for an opportunity to work hard, pay taxes like other \ncitizens, and, mostly, live our lives in peace for the first time, and for some of us, to live in peace in the only country \nthat we call home.'' Before I go into other testimony, I want to recognize so many of our Members who have been \nhere on the floor with us and some who are watching from their offices and sending their memos. But I do want to \nacknowledge the presence of Congressman Carbajal of California, a champion on this. They are all distinguished \nchampions on this issue, very concerned, working very hard for us to get a debate and a vote on the floor. \nCongressman Carbajal of California, a freshman member; Congressman Kildee of Michigan, who leads the way \nwith 1-minutes on the floor; Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, whose birthday was yesterday and who is \nsharing, today, with us. I acknowledged her earlier. I thank her. Congresswoman Waters; Congresswoman \nVelazquez; Congressman Correa of California; Congresswoman Matsui of California; Congressman Gomez of \nCalifornia; again, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, now my third time to acknowledge Congresswoman Jackson Lee; \nCongressman Takano of California; Congresswoman Barbara Lee. I read the testimony of her DREAMer earlier. \nCongressman Lowenthal of California; Congressman Darren Soto of Florida. He has been such a champion right \nfrom the start. I was down with him at a university like the first month of his being in Congress, and that day I spoke \nto General Kelly right from the venue where we were speaking to the students, and General Kelly told me that he \ncared deeply about DREAMers. I had confidence that he would help us, and I still do, on this very important value \nthat we share. [[Page H941]] Congressman Mike Thompson of California; Congressman Cardenas, who was just \nhere, of California; Congressman Tonko of New York; Congresswoman Alma Adams of North Carolina. I mentioned \nCongresswoman Zoe Lofgren. Again, I acknowledge her. Congressman Panetta, who presented testimony here; \nCongressman Norcross of New Jersey. There is lots of New Jersey testimony here. Congressman Cartwright of \nPennsylvania has been with us for a long while; Congressman Serrano of New York, a champion of all of those \nissues, including our fight to be fair and just to Puerto Rico; Congressman Ellison. I read the testimony of his \nDREAMer earlier. Congresswoman Eshoo, I acknowledge her again for her extraordinary leadership. She has faith \nthat this will happen, and we pray together over it. Congresswoman Norma Torres of California, reminding me that \ntomorrow is the National Prayer Breakfast; Congressman Ruiz of California; Congressman McGovern from \nMassachusetts, who has been with us a long time; Congresswoman Val Demings, a new member of the Judiciary \nCommittee from Florida; and Congressman Castro of Texas, San Antonio. We had testimony from there. {time} \n1430 I acknowledge Congressman Al Green from Houston, Texas; Congressman Gene Green from Houston, \nTexas; Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, whom we had beautiful testimony from earlier; Congresswoman \nSlaughter from New York; Congressman Huffman from California; Congressman McNerney from California; \n\n\n\nCongresswoman Barragan from California; Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky from Illinois; Congressman \nGaramendi from California; Congresswoman Bonamici from Oregon; Congresswoman Jayapal--again, I \nacknowledge her leadership--who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, the committee of jurisdiction for this; \nagain, I acknowledge Congressman John Lewis; Congressman Cicilline, who is a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee; and Congressman Juan Vargas from California. They have been just extraordinary, all of them. Again, \nthe members of the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman Bennie Thompson was in meetings with us \npreparing to come to the floor, and I want to acknowledge his leadership on this as well. Congressman Adam Schiff \nspent some time with us in Caucus downstairs on this subject. So many of our colleagues participated in our early \nmorning meeting until our next meeting to come to the floor. I will tell you about the early morning meeting, which \nbegan around 8 a.m., because when I went into the meeting at 8, I said to our colleagues that from 8 this morning \nuntil 12 tomorrow night is 40 hours, Mr. Speaker. Forty hours. A strong Biblical number: 40 years in the desert for \nthe Jews, Moses and Aaron; 40 years. Forty days in the desert with Christ. Forty days of Lent, so important to many \nof us here. Forty hours as a Catholic ritual, the 40 days observing the 40 hours. Forty hours is a number that is \nfraught with opportunity. It is a prayerful time, too, whether it was in the desert with Christ or in Lent or 40 hours of \nreligious devotion. We should use these 40 hours. I thought of coming to the floor, as I said earlier, when Senator \nDurbin was here and we sang his praises for being such a champion on this issue. I was going to come and bring \nmy rosary blessed by the Pope and talk about not just one rosary, five-decade, but all three, the full rosary. That \nwould take some time. Prayerful about that. Instead, I did that during the night and came here to make sure that \neveryone who follows Congress knows the stories of these DREAMers and how consistent they are with the \naspirations of our Founders; how proud our Founders would be of the aspirations of these young people to make \nthe future better; to give back to community; to pledge allegiance to America; and to fulfill life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness that our Founders--imagine Founders putting as a purpose of our Nation the pursuit of \nhappiness. They were so wonderful. Everything we do here has to be to honor the vision of our Founders, to honor \nthe sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and what they do to make America the country that we are, the \nhome of the brave and the land of the free, and also the aspiration of our children. So I reiterate the statement I \nmade earlier: this is about the children. It is about the children. Think of it as CHIP. CHIP is a healthcare program \nfor the children. It is handled discretely. It has broad support. It is not the whole healthcare bill. It is CHIP for the \nchildren. This is DREAMers for the children. It is not the whole immigration bill. It is this. It is a confidence-building \nstep, a first step. We go to the next, more complicated step of comprehensive immigration reform we all know. That \nis why it is in our legislation that we are beseeching the President--excuse me, well, the President to support, but \nour Speaker to give us an opportunity to bring to the floor. It recognizes our responsibility to protect our borders. It \nrecognizes our need to be true to who we are and true to our nature in terms of being inspired by these DREAMers \nand giving them the protections that they should have. So we want that opportunity. Some other colleagues have \narrived who have been helping work on this issue. Our distinguished chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, \nMr. Crowley. I think he has been present at every meeting we have had with the large and small DREAMers, friends \nof DREAMers, and the rest. I thank the gentleman for his leadership. Mr. Levin has also been a strong advocate. \nComing from Michigan, he brings a heartland perspective to our discussion. I thank Mr. Levin. I thank Carolyn \nMaloney from New York. Of course, New Yorkers think they own this issue, but so do we in California. But it is a \nheartland issue as well. So I am very proud of all the Members who have come here, and also for the work that they \nhave done. There are many others who have been working very hard on this issue when we started our meetings at \n8 o'clock this morning, continued in our leaders meeting with Mr. Crowley and Mr. Hoyer about where we go from \nhere in terms of the budget negotiations that have gone on. As I said earlier, there are many good things in the \nbudget agreement. They have been responsive in a bipartisan way. Again, it is a compromise. I just return to that \nbecause some people may not have heard my first statement. The budget caps agreement includes many \nDemocratic priorities. With the disaster recovery package and dollar-for-dollar increases in defense and nondefense \nbudget, Democrats have secured hundreds of billions of dollars to invest in communities across America. There will \nbe billions in funding to fight opioids and to strengthen our veterans. Remember what our priorities were. They were \nbipartisan priorities that we were fighting for, appealing for: fighting opioids, strengthening our veterans, the National \nInstitutes of Health, to build job-creating rural infrastructure and broadband, and to fund access to childcare and \nquality higher education. So it is a good piece of work. This morning we took a measure of our Caucus because the \npackage really does nothing to advance a bipartisan legislation to protect DREAMers in the House. Without a \ncommitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package cannot have \nmy support. However, I am hopeful that we can get that commitment. Let me say about this House of \n\n\n\nRepresentatives, first of all, as far as the Constitution is concerned, we take the oath to protect and defend it. That \nis our responsibility. Of all the things I thought--I thought I might be hungry, I thought I might be thirsty--I never \nthought I would get the sniffles from the rug. But I can handle it if you can. Honoring the Constitution of the United \nStates is so important. The first branch, Article I, the legislative branch, we are the first branch of government. We \nare the people's House in the wisdom of our Founders elected every 2 years to have us constantly accountable to \nour constituents. The Constitution said that appropriations bills should begin in the House. So the House sent over \na continuing resolution. [[Page H942]] Was that yesterday? It seems like a long time ago now. The Senate is acting \nupon that by adding to it the compromise that I described and which I think is a good piece of work. I commend both \nthe leaders, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, for their negotiations for which our House Democratic input was \na major part. So I associate myself with it. However, the difference between the House and the Senate is that \nSenator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, was respectful of his members who asked in a \nbipartisan way for him to bring a bill to the floor, and he will give that opportunity. The chips will fall where they may \nwhen they have the debate, but they viewed that opportunity as a fair one. We are asking for the same thing. Now, \nin our House, our bipartisan bill is further developed. It is the Hurd-Aguilar bill, which, as I said, recognizes our \nresponsibility to protect our borders, but also does the job for our DREAMers. It is just a piece of the immigration \nbill, but a confidence builder in a bipartisan way, done, again, in a bipartisan way to build unity with transparency. \nLet's have the debate on the floor. So why should we be considered the place where appropriations begin, the \nplace where we will have to take a vote on that again, the only place in America where you can't debate the issue? \nGive us a chance. Give us a vote. Put it all on the floor. Make it queen of the hill. Bring your Goodlatte bill to the \nfloor. Maybe what the Senate comes up with should be on the floor as well. We will see what that is. It is bipartisan. \nWe know that it will be bipartisan. That requires a big vote, a supervote in the Senate, the Hurd-Aguilar bill, which \nhas enough Republican cosponsors and many more supporters to justify it being brought to the floor. So what we \nare asking for is just simply a vote. No guaranty. Just the ability to debate and consider. Queen of the hill, whoever \ngets the most votes, that is the bill that would prevail in the House of Representatives. If that would be the Senate \nbill, then that would be the end of it, and that would go to the President. If it is the Hurd- Aguilar, that would go to \nConference, as would the Goodlatte bill, should that get the highest number of votes. But I don't anticipate that \nwould be the case because I don't think it has bipartisan support. But, again, have the debate and let the chips fall \nwhere they may. So that is why we are here. Since we can't have that debate, all night, as I was saying my rosaries \nblessed by the Pope in honor of my mother, I thought: Can we say the Rosary on the floor? Where can we have this \ndebate? Maxine's bill. We have to be here for Maxine's bill. I will use my 1 minute--my leadership 1 minute to tell \nthese stories, which they are so much more eloquent than anything any of us can say. But we do not deserve any \nright, any of us, to say we love DREAMers or anything like that unless we have an intention of doing something \nabout it. The DREAMers have worked so hard with such dignity over so many years, some of them. They have \nearned the high regard of the American people. One of the figures that is so overwhelming: 90 percent want the \nDREAMers to stay, 80 percent with citizenship, and 70 percent of the Republicans support the DREAMers. So we \nare not asking for something off the wall. It is something that is--yes, maybe it is off the wall. Maybe the wall is the \nissue here, but nonetheless. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, again talking about those Founders, a new \norder for the ages, every generation taking the responsibility for making the future better for the next. Every \ntestimony talks about that. Parents are making sacrifices for their children to have a better life, a direct reflection of \nthe American Dream of hope, determination, optimism, and faith, faith in God, faith in the future, faith in America, \nfaith in family, faith in the work ethic, and faith in education. All of these testimonies talk about giving back. There is \nnot an ounce of arrogance anyplace. All of them are appreciative of what America has given them. Sometimes \nnaming names, other times schools, other times churches, but always understanding that the opportunities they \nhave are a blessing from our country, and we recognize that they are a blessing to America. With that, we will go on \nto Ana Sanchez. Ana says: ``Like any other beneficiary of DACA, I, for once, have been given the opportunity to \npursue my dreams by attaining higher education and a job. I am Ana Sanchez, an 18-year-old undocumented \nstudent who was brought to this country when I was only 2 years old. Due to living conditions of my home country, \nmy parents decided to immigrate to the United States to offer me and my sister a much better education and a \nbrighter future. ``Growing up, I was aware that I was born in Mexico. However, I did not know the effects of being \nundocumented until high school came about. Now that I am older, I realize who I am in the eyes of the \ngovernment, and it saddens me to know that people believe these misconceptions of us. I mean, ever since we \narrived in Texas, my dad has risked his health and life by working under dangerous conditions just to earn enough \nmoney to provide food and shelter for my family. {time} 1445 ``When it was announced that DACA would be \n\n\n\navailable for people like me, my family did not think twice; we all knew it was an advantage and a precious \nopportunity the country had given us. Finally we had been given the chance to prove that we are part of this \ncountry's future and success. Because of DACA, I am able to say I am a part-time student and part-time staff for an \nafter-school program.'' Ana goes on to say: ``I am two steps closer to becoming a businesswoman and a teacher, \nand that gives me hope. Sadly, however, the new administration has posed threats that would make my hope and \nmy dreams unreachable. If the permit is taken away, our hard work will become worthless. I want to give back to \nthis country, so I yearn Congress to give me that chance.'' We thank Ana for her statement. Fidencio Fifield-Perez \nsays: ``A high school teacher told me, `People like you don't go to college.' I was accepted to seven colleges after \ngraduating with honors from Emsley A. Laney High School, and I now hold a BFA from Memphis College of Art as \nwell as an MA and MFA from the University of Iowa. ``In July 2012, I stood in front of the television with tears rolling \ndown my face as I heard President Obama enact the controversial executive action after the DREAM Act, a \nbipartisan bill, failed to reach cloture in the Senate. Even through those tears, I knew that my life and the lives of so \nmany others were at risk and that most people would never see this. ``I was the first of my family to graduate from \nhigh school. Every undocumented person I knew, other than my two younger brothers, dropped out either \nbecause it was expected of them or because a high school diploma meant nothing for the jobs to which they \napplied. I remember being told to get a job that paid under the table and to keep my head down. This was contrary \nto what my elementary and high school teachers had told me. `Work hard, and you too can make something of \nyour life.' Of course, they were as unaware of my status as I was of the full repercussions that came with it.'' \nEveryone was excited to start college, and he goes on to talk about all of that, but it is a similar story about the \nsacrifices of parents, the sacrifices of parents to take the risk, parents to work hard and encourage education, \nparents wanting to make the future better for their children. It is a beautiful, beautiful story. Julyanna Carvalho \nRogers: ``I came to the United States for the first time when I was 11 years old. My younger sister was brought to \nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital with leukemia.'' How beautiful. ``We came back 3 years later for her \ncheckup, and we found out she had relapsed. My dad was afraid of trying to change our expiring tourist visa in case \nwe had to go back to Brazil and my sister would not be able to receive treatment. My sister is now a cancer survivor \nand would not have been if we had gone back to Brazil. My family left everything behind to save her and give \n[[Page H943]] us a better life. Thanks to Obama's DACA, I was able to work and help pay for my college education. \nThanks to Obama, my sister also received health insurance; as a two-time cancer survivor, she needs a lot of care \nand attention. ``I thought about giving up many times. I've always been afraid to tell my story because so many \ntimes I've felt judgment towards immigrants. I'm no longer afraid, I feel that if everyone shares their story, others \nwill empathize and realize we all have the same story. ``Four years ago, when I felt my lowest, I met my husband. \nWe fell in love right away. We found each other after years of searching. We now have two dogs, and we plan on \nhaving kids in the next few years.'' That sounds like my daughter. She says: You are going to be a grandparent of a \ngrandpuppy. Okay, thanks. Now we have nine, but our first grandchild was a big dog. ``I'm extremely passionate \nabout helping others, and I currently volunteer for One Family Memphis, a foundation that is building from the \nground up. I am looking forward to making a difference in the Memphis community as well as raising my kids to see \nthe light hidden in every darkness.'' Carol Shea-Porter is here from New Hampshire, as well as Susan Davis from \nCalifornia. I thank them for their leadership and being here. Another story from Sheila Jackson Lee. Alonso Guillen. \nLast September, Alonso, a Mexican National and DREAMer, drove more than 100 miles from his home in Lufkin, \nTexas, to help those trapped by Hurricane Harvey's flooding in the Houston area. But he and another man \ndisappeared after their boat capsized in the flood-swollen creek Wednesday, and relatives went back searching for \ntheir bodies. He moved to Lufkin at age 14 from across the border in Mexico, graduated from Lufkin High School, \nand worked in construction. He often organized fundraisers for those in need and masterminded his rescue trip to \nthe Houston area on the fly with friends' help. When Hurricane Harvey hit, they borrowed a boat and drove South to \nsave strangers. How beautiful. Alonzo is survived by his 8-year-old daughter, Mariana. Mariana, you are in our \nprayers, and we thank you for sharing your father with America and for his sacrifice. How sad. Thank you. Donald \nPayne, Jr.'s State of the Union guest was Juan Lopez from New Jersey. Juan Lopez migrated to the United States \nfrom Uruguay at age 2 and was raised in Newark, New Jersey. He was selected for the Rutgers Future Scholars \nprogram, which is a college preparatory mentoring program for select first-generation, low-income, academically \npromising students from local schools. Lopez is a senior at Newark Science Park High School and plans to attend \nRutgers-Newark on a scholarship to study pre-engineering. In anticipation of the State of the Union Address, Lopez \nissued the following message: ``My name is Juan Lopez, and I arrived in the United States of America at the young \nage of 2 years old. I have been living in the United States for over 15 years now.'' He is 17 now, Mr. Speaker. ``I \n\n\n\nremember the first time I heard my legal status referred to as illegal alien. I immediately felt as though the term did \nnot fit. Alien means outsider, and I have never felt like one. ``I have lived the entirety of my life in the same place, \nbut I am not ashamed of where I was from. I embraced the term undocumented and have used it as a propelling \nforce in my own pursuit of greatness.'' Imagine, his own pursuit of greatness. You go, you 17-year-old Juan Lopez. \n``I am a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, otherwise known as DACA, and it is something I am \nvery proud of. I am a DREAMer, and I will continue to dream whether it is here or wherever the government sends \nme.'' Karji Forhit. This is the opening line: `` `I think you get married after you graduate high school.' These are \nwords my SAT tutor said to me during my college consultation visit. Halfway through making my college list, he \nabruptly halted the conversation and, for a moment, my future. He did not think that I was fit for college, despite my \ntop-notch academic record that I maintained since the day I entered prekindergarten. The only viable options he \nsaw from all undocumented youths was marriage.'' ``My name is Karji Forhit, and I am an undocumented \nimmigrant. I was born in India and grew up in the diverse streets of Jackson Heights''-- in the heights, New York \nCity--``since third grade. I have worked hard not only to help myself, but help those in undocumented \ncommunities.'' He goes on to say: ``My mother decided to move to America because it is where the rains of hard \nwork, sprinkled with luck, equals success. When President Obama created DACA, it gave me the opportunity to \nattend the University of Notre Dame, where I am pursuing my goal of getting a Ph.D. in economics. DACA allows \nme to work not only as a research assistant to Professor Jeffrey Bergstrand, but also as a tutor at the Notre Dame \nwriting center. Honing my writing and research skills will not only advance my career, but will also advance the \ncareers of my fellow undocumented peers at Notre Dame. While Notre Dame has provided numerous \nopportunities for its DACA students, there is still a lot of work to be done. I am the second generation of \nundocumented students that Notre Dame has publicly accepted. Last summer, I conducted research on medical \nschool admission policies for undocumented students. This research is critical for the campus career services \nwhen providing guidance and up-to-date information for current pre-med majors looking for medical schools that \nare mostly DACA friendly.'' Karji Forhit goes on and on and talks about that and the need for doctors in our country. \nSo it is, again, another chance for more doctors. We have talked about health professionals. We have talked about \nresearchers in the healthcare field. We have talked about doctors, dentists. We have talked about graduate \nstudents and health-related issues and the need for more health professionals in our country to meet the health \nneeds of our country. We hear this coming from these students. Since we were talking here about this, I wanted to \njust mention we talked about Notre Dame here, but so many of the institutions of higher learning in our country have \nbeen so supportive of our DREAMers. The administrations of these institutions of higher learning have been \nadvocates for the DREAMers. They have tried to accommodate them where possible, advocate for them wherever, \nand part of what we talked about earlier. Earlier, we talked about Bibles, badges in our law enforcement community, \nand the business community. The business community, tied in with the academic community, has been a \ntremendous resource. I particularly want to mention the CEO of IBM. IBM has been so good to its DREAMers. They \nhave respected them, given them opportunities, and advocated and brought them to the Capitol, come here with \ntheir CEO. It is just really quite remarkable, but I could say that about a large swath of companies in Silicon Valley. \nBill Gates has been a champion on this issue. I really give them credit for keeping the prestige of this issue in such \na high, high place and making it a priority in their advocacy here and, importantly, in their community. The business \ncommunity has been spectacular both in terms of small business and corporate America as well. Again, since we \nhave newcomers here, I want to go back to our bishop statement from earlier. I thought it would be useful once \nagain, since we have a new Speaker, to read the statement of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. This was \ntheir statement on the decision to end DACA and urge Congress to find a legislative solution. That is what we are \ntrying to do today, is find a legislative solution, or at least give it a chance to be debated on the floor. The following \nstatement from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, President Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo from Galveston, \nHouston; along with Vice President Archbishop Jose H. Gomez from Los Angeles; Bishop Joe S. Vasquez from \nAustin, Texas, who is the chairman of the Committee on Migration; Bishop Joseph J. Tyson from [[Page H944]] \nYakima, chairman of the Subcommittee on Pastoral Care of Migrants, Refugees, and Travelers says the \n``cancelation of the DACA program is reprehensible.'' The statement follows: ``The cancellation of the DACA \nprogram is reprehensible. It causes unnecessary fear for DACA youths and their families. These youth entered the \nU.S. as minors and often know America as their only home. ``The Catholic Church has long watched with pride and \nadmiration as DACA youth live out their daily lives with hope and a determination to flourish and contribute to \nsociety: continuing to work and provide for their families, continuing to serve in the military, and continuing to \nreceive an education. ``Now, after months of anxiety and fear about their futures, these brave young people face \n\n\n\ndeportation. This decision is unacceptable and does not reflect who we are as Americans,'' the bishops said. {time} \n1500 They go on to say: ``The Church has recognized and proclaimed the need to welcome young people: \n`Whoever welcomes one of these' ''--now, this quote is so beautiful, and we should remember it in everything we \ndo. It is in Mark 9:37. ``Whoever welcomes one of these children in my name welcomes me, and whoever \nwelcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.'' Christ welcoming, we welcome Christ, we welcome \nGod who sent him--so beautiful. The bishop goes on to say: ``Today, our Nation has done the opposite of how \nScripture calls us to respond. It is a step back from the progress that we need to make as a country. Today's \nactions represent a heartbreaking moment in our history that shows the absence of mercy and good will and a \nshortsighted vision of the future. DACA users are woven into the fabric of our country and of our Church and are, by \nevery social and human measure, American youth. ``We strongly urge Congress to act and immediately resume \nwork toward a legislative solution. We pledge our support to work on finding an expeditious means of protection for \nDACA youth. . . .'' ``As people of faith, we say to DACA youth--regardless of your immigration status, you are \nchildren of God and welcome in the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church supports you and will advocate for you.'' \nThat was September 5, 2017. That was the day that the President issued his statement. Now, having worked with \nthe bishops for awhile, for them to have such a definitive statement so quickly is pretty remarkable because \nsometimes it takes a bill longer for their deliberative process to work, but this came right away. Okay. This is \ndoctors and DREAMers. I mentioned about the need for doctors and the ambition and the vocation that these young \npeople were feeling towards becoming doctors, and I read this. The Association of American Medical Colleges \nreports that the Nation's doctor shortage will rise between 40,000 and 105,000 by the year 2030. Both the American \nMedical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges have warned that ending DACA will \nexacerbate this physician shortage in the United States, and they have urged Congress to pass legislation to \nprotect DREAMers. Are you listening? Listen to what the AMA said. ``Estimates have shown that the DACA \ninitiatives could help introduce 5,400 previously ineligible physicians into the U.S. healthcare system in the coming \ndecades to help address physician shortages and ensure patient access to care.'' Remember, those with DACA \nstatus will particularly create care shortages for rural and other underserved areas. Without these physicians, the \nAMA is concerned that the quality of care provided in these communities will be negatively impacted and that \npatient access to care will suffer. This is remarkable, and I am glad it will be submitted for the Record, but I am \ngoing to make sure all of our Members have this. I acknowledged Mr. Thompson earlier. Congresswoman Grace \nNapolitano of California is with us now. We have got Jackie Speier, I acknowledge her; Jamie Raskin of Maryland; \nVal Demings, I mentioned earlier. Let me see. Alma Adams, I recognized earlier, too. Ms. Barragan; Brenda \nLawrence from Michigan, who brings that heartland of America perspective to it; Ann Kuster of New Hampshire. \nCongresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas is with us as well. Many Members have come and gone, some \non more than one occasion, but I acknowledge everyone who has been here already. Anybody new on this side? \nOkay. So we probably want to hear now about Victor Esparza. Victor Esparza says: ``The day I received my \nemployment authorization card through President Obama's DACA program is the day I began to live without fear. \nThe uber-small and not very well-known village of Eau Claire, Michigan, is the place that raised me since I was 7 \nyears old. ``My elementary school teachers never treated me differently because I came from somewhere else and \ndidn't speak the language at the time, and for that, I loved them. I took pride in doing my best in my high school \ncourses even though I was filled with anxiety for not knowing what would be next in my life after my graduation in \nthe summer of 2008. ``As my former high school peers went off to universities and employment, I went off to live in \nthe shadows, living under the metaphorical shadow referred to as driving without a proper driving permit, as the \nState you lived in required proof of legal residency when applying for a driver's license. Driving like this meant \nrisking legal problems when heading out to the grocery store if you made a driving mistake and got caught for it. \n``Living in the shadows meant no financial assistance at your local community college, which pretty much created \nan impossible financial barrier between your career dreams and you. In the shadows, you had no options but to \nwork in the same farm as your family. ``And let me tell you, perseverance is a requirement when laboring for below \nthe minimum hourly rate in sweat-inducing conditions. This life was my own before DACA, and I may not be in the \nshadows any longer, but my families and relatives haven't escaped yet. ``I have been working as an IT supporter \nand analyst for a midsize drug company for under a year now. This is the best job I ever had, and I don't say this \nbecause my hourly pay has increased. I genuinely love what I'm doing now,'' Victor tells us. ``Unless you know me \non a deep level, you would think I was just another 26-year-old with a promising career and not someone plagued \nby fear of Trump campaign promises. This narrative, I feel, is not only mine. It is owned, shared by hundreds of \nthousands of others who also have persevered because of DACA. If I could have had a conversation with the \n\n\n\nPresident-elect, I would tell him just that, that we have persevered.'' Thank you, Victor. Senator Durbin has sent us \nsome more stories. Again, he is our hero in the Senate. He introduced the bill in 2001. He has spent most of his \nofficial career with DACA as a priority. He has been a champion for America's working families. He is about creating \njobs, good-paying jobs for the future, about safety in the workplace. He is the person, along with Frank Lautenberg, \nwho got smoking off of airlines. Thank you, as one who travels. Last week, I had eight flights in 10 days. I thank \nSenator Durbin for that. He has been a champion in so many, many ways: champion of the National Institutes of \nHealth, of learning from experience in his own daughter's health, about the need for Biblical power to cure that the \nNational Institutes of Health has and appropriated for. The list of his accomplishments is great, and this is one of \nthem, the DREAMers. So he sent us this story from Cesar Montelongo: Today, I want to tell you about Cesar \nMontelongo. When Cesar was 10 years old, his family came to the United States from Mexico. He grew up in New \nMexico, where his academic prowess was quickly apparent. He graduated high school with a grade point average \nabove 4.0, and he was ranked third in his class--third in his class. [[Page H945]] Cesar was a member of the chess, \nFrench, Spanish, physics, and science clubs. He even took college courses the last 2 years of high school. Cesar \nwent on to New Mexico State University, where he was a triple major in biology, microbiology, and Spanish, as well \nas two minors in chemistry and biochemistry. Cesar graduated with distinction in the honors track with a 3.9 GPA. \nCesar then earned a master's degree in biology, with a minor in molecular biology, while also working as a teaching \nassistant. Today, Cesar is the first DACA student enrolled in the M.D.-Ph.D. program at Loyola University--Chicago-\n-Stritch School of Medicine. He is entering his third year of this highly competitive program, and upon completion, \nhe will receive a medical degree and a doctorate degree in science. Cesar is one of the more than 30 DACA \nrecipients at the Stritch School of Medicine, which was the first medical school to admit students with DACA \nstatus. Thank you, Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine. This began in 2014 when they admitted DACA \nstudents. DACA students do not receive special treatment in the selection process and are not eligible for any \nFederal financial assistance. Many have committed to working in a medically underserved community in Illinois after \ngraduation. Cesar Montelongo is researching how bladder viruses shape bacteria populations and the potential \nimplications for urinary infections and disease. Wow. He is also a member of the pathology medical group, a \nSpanish interpreter at a clinic, and a mentor for other medical students. When asked what drew him to medicine, \nCesar says: ``When I was very young, my father became ill and then was bedridden for months. He was the \nprimary breadwinner, and I saw him as our protector. Watching him immobilized and screaming in pain impacted \nmy world view. Years later, we found out that my father had suffered from diabetic myopathy and neuropathy. \nLearning that both his illness and our family suffering could have been prevented by education and relatively \ninexpensive medication was heartbreaking. By that time, it made me realize the potential of medicine.'' Cesar's \ndream for the future? To become a practicing physician and a scientist and to develop new and improved clinical \ndiagnostic tools so that doctors can diagnose and treat disease faster. Close to 70 DREAMers are in medical \nschool around the country. But without DACA, these DREAMers will not become physicians and they could be \ndeported back to countries where they haven't lived since they were children. Will America be a stronger country if \nwe deport people like Cesar? I don't think so. The answer is clear. Remember that AMA statement from earlier \nabout how important this all is. I don't have it here right now. We now want to talk about William Medeiros: When \nWilliam was only 6 years old, his family moved to the United States from Brazil. William grew up in the Boston area \nand then moved to Florida. In high school, he was an honors student and graduated with a 3.8 GPA. He was also \nan athlete, playing on his high school's soccer and football teams. William is now a student at the University of \nCentral Florida, where he has a 3.5 GPA. He will graduate in the spring of 2019 with his bachelor's degree in \ncriminal justice. He is also working a full-time job in order to support himself. Because he is a DACA recipient, \nWilliam is ineligible for any financial aid from the Federal Government. William's dream? To enlist in the military, \nand then, after serving his country, to become an officer with his local police department. Thanks to DACA, William \nis on his way to fulfilling his dream. Last year, he enlisted in the Army through the Medical Accessions Vital to \nNational Interest program, known as MAVNI. And here is a photo of him with his recruiter at the enlistment \nceremony. The MAVNI program, as I mentioned earlier, allows immigrants with skills that are vital to the national \ninterest to enroll in the armed services. More than 800 DACA recipients with these critical skills have joined the \nmilitary through MAVNI just through that program. Some in the Trump administration claim that DACA is taking \njobs away from Americans, but William and hundreds of other DREAMers have vital skills that our military couldn't \nfind elsewhere. William, along with other DREAMers, is waiting to ship out to basic training. He continues his \nundergraduate studies and working full-time, waiting his chance to serve the country he loves. William wrote this \nletter: ``My desire to serve this Nation and help people, to pay back my dues for everything I received from this \n\n\n\ngreat country, and to lead by example by showing my fellow DACA members that anything is possible with hard \nwork, perseverance, and dedication.'' William Medeiros and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our \ncountry, but without the Dream Act, William and hundreds of other immigrants with skills that are vital to our \nnational interests will be kicked out of the Army. They want nothing more than to serve, and they are willing to die \nfor the country they call home. Instead, they could be deported back to countries they haven't lived in since they \nwere children. Will America be stronger if we deport William and people like him who want to stay here and serve in \nthe armed services? I think the answer is quite clear. No, we won't be strong. Today, again, I want to tell you about \nXimena Magana. When Ximena was 9 years old, her family came to the United States from Mexico City. She was \nraised in the city of Houston. We have a lot of Houston folks. Jerry McNerney, I acknowledged him earlier, and \nthank him for being here. Mr. McGovern, I acknowledged him earlier. Mr. Grijalva, Raul Grijalva, who has been \nreally an outstanding leader on this subject, has joined us, but he has been with us in every meeting today on the \nsubject. I thank Raul for joining us here. I acknowledged her earlier, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, the fact that \nshe was the chair of the Spanish Caucus the year when we passed the DREAM Act in the House of \nRepresentatives. And as I acknowledged earlier, Senator Durbin was the author in the Senate. It got a majority of \nthe votes, but not 60. So I thank those two leaders once again. {time} 1515 Ximena was 9 years old when her family \ncame to the United States from Mexico City. She was raised in the city of Houston and lives there today. In high \nschool, Ximena served in the United States Army's Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp, known as the Junior \nROTC program. Under her leadership, Ximena's battalion was named the best battalion in the Houston \nIndependent School District. Ximena also serves as captain of her high soccer team and a regular volunteer at the \nHouston Food Bank. A real leader, Ximena is majoring in communications at the University of Houston. She has \ninterned with United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee and City Council Member Robert Gallegos. Due to \nXimena's community service, she was asked by the mayor of Houston to serve as the youngest member of the \nMayor's Hispanic Advisory Board. She is the first DACA recipient to serve on the board. Last week, in the aftermath \nof Hurricane Harvey, Ximena stepped in to help her community just like she has always done. She volunteered at \nshelters helping people with FEMA and Red Cross applications. She was joined by many other DACA recipients. It \nis a stunning story of DACA recipients helping after Hurricane Harvey. Ximena wrote me a letter--this is from \nSenator Durbin. She asked for only one thing: for President Trump to come visit the Houston DACA volunteers, to \nmeet these heroes, to look in their eyes, hear their stories before deporting them to countries they barely know. \nXimena and other dreamers have so much to contribute to our country. Again, I ask the country: Will America be \nstronger if we deported Ximena? I don't think so. [[Page H946]] Cristina Velasquez--no relation to Congresswoman \nVelazquez. Today I want to tell you about Cristina Velasquez. When Cristina was 6 years old, her family came to \nthe United States from Caracas, Venezuela. She went to elementary school in Madison, Wisconsin. Cristina wrote \nthis letter. In it, she talked about her childhood, and she said: ``I spent my formative childhood years in the Midwest, \nwhere I learned to assimilate and learn the values that this country was founded on. The salt-of-the-earth quality of \nthe people around me and extraordinary kindness between strangers shaped my own values and attitude towards \nothers. Growing up in Madison taught me a great deal about compassion, patience, and hard work.'' Cristina was \nan outstanding student. In high school, she was a member of the National Honor Society--you have heard that over \nand over and over again, the National Honor Society--and she also was elected as vice president of her class and \nmanager of the track team. She also found time to volunteer. I love the way kids are so top-notch, academically, \nparticipate in athletics and the rest, and in their spare time work at the local camp for pre-K students or the food \nbank or whatever it is. Cristina graduated with honors from Miami Dade College. She is currently a student at \nGeorgetown University, majoring in international law, institutions and ethics. She received the President's Volunteer \nService Award 2 years in a row and is a Walsh Scholar. And as a Hoya mom and Hoya wife and Hoya \ngrandmother, I can tell you, being a Walsh Scholar at Georgetown, that is a very big deal. During her time at \nGeorgetown, Cristina has interned at the U.S. House of Representatives and piloted a college mentorship program \nat a local high school. In addition to this, she finds time to work two part-time jobs. How many hours do you have in \na day, Cristina? She has also dedicated two of her undergraduate summers during the school year to volunteer as \na teacher in Miami and in San Francisco. In both these positions, she works with high-achieving, low-income \nstudents providing support for their path to college. You see, Cristina's dream is to be a teacher. She will graduate \nfrom Georgetown soon. She has been accepted to Teach For America, a national nonprofit organization that places \nTalent Regents graduates in urban and rural schools. Teach For America has 190 teachers who are DACA \nDREAMers and are teaching our children across the country. Is that beautiful? In any event, Cristina is scheduled to \nstart the program next summer and start teaching next fall, but without DACA or the Dream Act, Cristina and 190 \n\n\n\nother teachers will be forced to leave their students behind. Again, will America be stronger? I don't think so. Jesus \nContreras: Jesus was only 6 years old when he was brought to the United States from Mexico by his mother, who \nsought safety from violence. He grew up in Houston. After graduating from high school as a top student, Jesus \nobtained DACA. This enabled him to pursue his dream of becoming a paramedic. Jesus attended Lone Star \nCollege in Houston and earned his paramedic certification. Today, Jesus is 23 years old. He works as a paramedic \nin the Montgomery County Hospital District. Through Hurricane Harvey, Jesus Contreras worked six straight days \nrescuing people from flood areas. He helped people who needed dialysis or insulin. He took flood victims to local \nhospitals. Afterward, he would stop at home for a quick shower before heading to his local church to volunteer, \nhelping flood victims with their medical needs. Jesus sent this letter, and it says: ``Houston is my home, and these \nare my people. I love my career. It has given me the opportunity to help people in ways I never imagined I could. \nDACA means everything to me. I would lose my license and certifications without it. I would be sent back to a \ncountry I don't know and would lose everything.'' Jesus and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our \ncountry. But without DACA, Jesus couldn't have worked to protect his community through Hurricane Harvey, and \nhe could be deported back to Mexico, where he hasn't lived since he was 6 years old. Will America be stronger if he \ngoes away? I don't think so, no. We have another Georgetowner here: Luis Gonzalez. When Luis was 8 years old, \nhis family came to the United States from Mexico. Luis had a difficult childhood in Santa Ana, California. After his \nparents separated, he lived with his mother in a car garage for several years. Then, after his mother remarried, \nLuis lived with an abusive stepfather. But Luis overcame these circumstances and became an excellent student. He \ngraduated high school in the top 1 percent of his class-- now that is a 1 percent we like to talk about--with a 4.69 \nGPA, and he passed all nine advanced placement exams that he took. Luis was also very involved in \nextracurricular and volunteer activities. He was the secretary of the school's--here it is again-- National Honor \nSociety chapter. Luis helped organize an anti-bullying campaign at a local elementary school. He created a \nmentorship program to help incoming freshmen at his high school. On Saturdays, instead of relaxing, he \nvolunteered to tutor other students in math--on Saturdays, every Saturday--and he volunteered to help a teacher at \na local elementary school. Luis was also very active in his church. Every Sunday, he translated the pastor's \nsermon into English for those who didn't speak Spanish. And he cleaned up the church before and after Sunday \nservice. Because of his outstanding record in high school, Luis was admitted to Georgetown University. He is \ncurrently a sophomore and majoring in American studies and minoring in government. Luis continues to use his \nspare time--really--to give back to the community. He is a member of the Provost's Committee for Diversity. He is \nthe co-chair of the Hoya Saxa Weekend, a program that brings students from underrepresented communities to \nvisit Georgetown. And Luis is a leader of Stride for College, a program that mentors students at local inner-city high \nschools. Luis' dream is to be a high school teacher, which is not surprising, given the strong commitment he has \nalready shown to helping young people. Luis wrote in his letter: ``DACA gave me the confidence and the security I \nhad not had before. I lived in fear and in the shadows. Thanks to DACA, however, I have been able to do things I \notherwise wouldn't be able to do, like traveling through an airport or working on a campus. I've always felt that I am \nan American, but having DACA allowed me to stop living in constant fear and uncertainty. Now these fears have \ncome back again.'' Will America be stronger if we deport Luis Gonzalez if he stays here and becomes a high \nschool teacher? I think that the answer is obvious. Now, on this subject of Georgetown and English, his second \nlanguage, and translating into English for those who don't speak Spanish. He cleaned up the church before and \nafter Sunday service. The thing about the church that is interesting, I just recently--and I won't read it again right \nnow, but the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' statement I read from His Holiness about immigrants \nwhen he was here in the Capitol--but I also mentioned Dr. Sam Rodriguez and other leaders in the evangelical \ncommunity who have been so outspoken on protecting our DREAMers. I know we all go to church services every \nweek. I mean, that is what I hear. I go to a lot of different places because I travel around the country. And more and \nmore around the country, and in my own community in California, more and more of our parishioners are from the \nPhilippines or from Latin America. So a lot of the future of the church--by the way, in one of the churches I go to in \nCalifornia, our pastor was from Nigeria. In my church in San Francisco, one of our priests was from the Philippines. \nThe idea of parishioners being more diverse is also the clergy being more diverse. So when we talk about faith and \nbuilding faith and strong faith in our [[Page H947]] country, recognize how faith-filled so many of these families are \nwho come to our country. Again, our motto is ``In God We Trust.'' It is wonderful to see their faith in God, their faith \nin America, their faith in the future, their fair in themselves, their faith in their families, and their faith that gives them \nhope, the faith in the goodness of others, as I said, hope, sitting right there between faith and charity. So just, again, \nthat spark of divinity that we all have, we have to act upon. We will talk about Benita Veliz. Benita was brought to \n\n\n\nthe United States by her parents when she was only 8. She graduated as the valedictorian of her high school \nclass at the age of 16. She received a full scholarship to St. Mary's University. She graduated from the honors \nprogram with a double major in biology and sociology. Her honors thesis was on the Dream Act. She wrote: ``I can't \nwait to be able to give back to the community that has given me so much. I was recently asked to sing the national \nanthem for both the United States and Mexico at a Cinco de Mayo community assembly. Without missing a beat, I \nquickly belted out the Star Spangled Banner. I then realized that I had no idea how to sing the Mexican national \nanthem. I am American. My dream is American. It is time to make our dreams a reality. It is time to pass the Dream \nAct.'' We have some photos. This is Javier Cuan-Martinez. Javier was only 4 years old when his family brought him \nto the United States from Mexico. Javier went to elementary school in Texas, and then moved to Temecula, \nCalifornia. Javier was an excellent student, who was very involved in extracurricular and volunteer activities as the \nmember of the National Honor Society and was named Riverside County's Student of the Month. He also received \nan award from the College Board's National Hispanic Recognition Program, which is given to only 5,000 of the \n250,000 Hispanic students who take the test. Javier was a member of the math club and a drum major in the \nschool's marching band. He volunteers in his town's soup kitchen for the homeless, and received the President of \nthe United States Volunteer Service Award. Javier didn't know he was undocumented until he was applying for \ncollege and learned that he was ineligible for Federal financial assistance. Thanks to his academic achievements, \nJavier was accepted at Harvard University. He is now majoring in computer science. He is also a member of the \nHarvard Computer Society and Harvard's marching band. Thanks to DACA, Javier is supporting himself by working \nas a web developer. Javier sent his letter. He wrote: ``DACA doesn't give me an advantage. Rather, it gives me the \nopportunity to create my own future on the same grounds as any other student. I would like to be judged upon my \nqualities as a person than what papers I happen to have in my hand. I hope to be a computer programmer and \nbegin earning my living as a contributing member of America's society.'' Consider this: every year, thousands of \nforeign computer programmers come to the United States as temporary guest workers under H-1B visas. It makes \nno sense to deport a homegrown talent, like Javier, when American companies are importing foreign computer \nspecialists. Javier and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country. God bless you, Javier. This is a \nstory from Terri Sewell. Mr. Speaker, I thank Terri Sewell for joining us. Terri brings this story of a DREAMer from \nAlabama. Fernanda Herrera said: ``I came to the U.S. when I was 2\\1/2\\ and grew up in Gadsden, Alabama, where \nI attended Gadsden City High School and played the flute in the band, serving as a section leader for 2 years. \n{time} 1530 ``I moved to Birmingham in 2013 to attend Samford University as an honor student majoring in \nInternational Relations. I graduated this past May, with thousands out in loans for my degree and am hoping to \nattend law school. ``My parents and U.S.-born little brother live in Ragland, where they own a small Mexican \nrestaurant under my name since I am the only person of age and with a Social Security number.'' They own it under \nthat. ``I recently had a car wreck that put me $40,000 further into debt. If DACA is taken away, I will not be able to \nwork to pay back my loans, my hospital debt, my car payments, or my debt from helping my parents with their \nrestaurant. Without a clean Dream Act, my U.S. citizen brother is forced to choose between having his sister or his \nparents here.'' Oh, we do have a picture here. How lovely. How cute the little brother is. How lovely. I thank Terri \nSewell for that and thank her for her extraordinary leadership from Alabama about a DREAMer. The DREAMers are \nall over our country, Mr. Speaker. They are a blessing so across the board. From the heartland of America, we have \nmany from Michigan, from Illinois, from Alabama, of course Texas heartland as well, but it is also a border State. \nLara Alvarado was 8 years old. Her family brought her to the United States from Mexico. She grew up in Chicago, \nIllinois. In high school, Lara was an excellent student and was involved in many extracurricular and volunteer \nactivities. She was a member of the National Honor Society--the National Honor Society, the resounding theme of \nall of this, a member of the National Honor Society. She played soccer, tennis, and basketball, and she was a \nmember of the student government, the school newspaper, the chess club and the yearbook club. Lara went to \nNortheastern Illinois University. In college, she worked two jobs to pay for her college tuition. Keep in mind, she is \nineligible for Federal financial assistance because of her immigration status. In 2006, Lara graduated with honors \nwith a major in justice studies; but then she was stuck. Lara wanted to become a lawyer but was unable to pursue \nthis dream, Mr. Speaker, because she was undocumented. Six long years later, in 2012, President Obama \nestablished DACA, and Lara's life changed. In 2013, Lara received DACA and enrolled in law school at Southern \nIllinois University. In law school, Lara won the moot court competition. She won the moot court competition--how \nabout that--and was selected for the Order of Barristers, a legal honor society. This spring, 10 years after she \ngraduated from college, Lara received her law degree. Over the summer, she passed her bar exam; and just last \nmonth, Lara received her Illinois law license, which she is proudly holding in this picture. You see, Lara never gave \n\n\n\nup on her dream of becoming a lawyer, and thanks to DACA and her hard work, this dream has become a reality. \nNow Lara is planning a career in public interest law. She says: ``I would like to be of service to others.'' In her letter, \nshe says: ``DACA has opened the door.'' I keep hearing that theme: open the door, open the door. Let the Speaker \nplease open the door so we can have that debate here, as Mitch McConnell has done in the Senate. Lara writes: \n``DACA has opened the door to possibilities that were beyond my reach. DACA represents a better life and the \nopportunity to achieve the American Dream. DACA has given me the freedom to live without fear. I now have the \nconfidence to know that my hard work, dedication, and achievements can be recognized. I will continue to work \nhard and lead by the example of what I can accomplish if given the opportunity.'' Lara and other DREAMers have \nso much to contribute to our country. Will America be a stronger country if we deport Lara? I don't think so. This is \nfrom Representative Engel from New York; it is one of his constituents. ``My name is Diana, a constituent of yours \nfrom Yonkers, New York. I am a DACA recipient who is currently in limbo not knowing what my future holds. I was \nable to obtain a driver's license and put myself through tech school where I obtained my EMT license. I also \nobtained phlebotomy and [[Page H948]] EKG certifications, which have certified me to work in the emergency room. \nIf Congress approves a path to citizenship, I would be able to accomplish so much more to give back to my family \nand community. I love what I am doing and do not want to lose all that I have worked for. Thank you for taking the \ntime to read my message. Sincerely, Diana.'' Another from Congressman Engel, a constituent. ``My name is Justa, \nfrom the Bronx, New York. I applied for DACA in July after finding out from an ICE officer that I had 60 days to leave \nthe country or face deportation. I am also about to lose my job because I have not received my new EAD card. \nDACA is my only hope.'' Elizabeth, again from Eliot Engel, from Yonkers. She writes to Congress: ``I am contacting \nyou because I submitted my initial DACA application earlier in 2017 and completed my biometrics in April. I have \nyet to receive any other guidance. I humbly ask if there's any way that you can help me out. I am absolutely \nheartbroken and in deep emotional stress because of everything that is going on at the moment with DACA. I have \ntwo children in 4th and 6th grades. I would not be able to imagine my life without them. I arrived in the U.S. when I \nwas 9 months old and am now 28. I have called USCIS, and the only information they provided was the one already \non their website. I just asked if it was possible to request an inquiry, and they said it wouldn't be possible. I just had \nto wait.'' Another one, Stephanie. Stephanie is the girlfriend of an unnamed DREAMer in Eliot Engel's district. ``I \nwrite to you today about DACA. My boyfriend is a DACA recipient. He is a building engineer who lives in New \nRochelle, New York. He is a high school graduate and has his associate's degree. He has no criminal record. He \npays taxes yet reaps none of the benefits available to citizens, welfare, Social Security, et cetera. He is a good \nperson from a good family. I am terrified that Congress will not be able to come to an agreement over DACA and \nhis safety will hang in the balance; that he could be sent back to a country he barely knows. I understand that you \nare against the decision to end DACA, but I beg you, please do not party lines and bargaining chips get in the way \nof fixing this. Do whatever is necessary. This has been a horrible day, but, in 6 months, it could get so much worse.'' \nI thank Eliot Engel for giving us those stories from his district. This is from Barbara. In 2002, when Barbara was 5 \nyears old, her family brought her to the United States from Mexico. Barbara grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and she \nknew she would face challenges because she was a DREAMer. Her older sister had been accepted at a State \nuniversity but could not afford to attend. As an undocumented immigrant, she is not eligible for Federal financial \nassistance, and Arizona law prohibits State financial assistance to DREAMers like Barbara and her sister. During \nher freshman year in high school, the mentor told her that, as a DREAMer: ``You're going to have to try harder \nthan everyone else.'' She says: ``Those words confirmed what I had known all along. Although I was only starting \nhigh school, I began to dread what most students anticipate with excitement, graduation day. What if I got into my \ndream school, but I couldn't go because I couldn't afford it?'' In high school, Barbara was an excellent student and \nwas involved in many extracurricular and volunteer activities. She was a member of the Academic Decathlon team \nfor 4 years and was a team captain during her senior year. She was a member of the student government, the \nyearbook club, the homecoming court; she volunteered to tutor middle school students and worked part-time to \nsave money for her education. Barbara also participated in a number of programs at Arizona State University, \nincluding the Walter Cronkite journalism institute. She recorded a story about her life, and it was aired around the \ncountry on National Public Radio. This experience sparked her interest in journalism and led to an internship at \nKJZZ, the Phoenix affiliate of National Public Radio. Last year, Barbara graduated as valedictorian of her high \nschool with a 4.5 GPA. As a result of her accomplishments, Barbara was accepted at Dartmouth College, an Ivy \nLeague school, where she is now a sophomore-- a great Ivy League school. Barbara writes: ``I'm very grateful for \nDACA allowing me to work and not be deported to a country I didn't know and have not been since I was 5. Just like \nthousands of other undocumented students, I have grown and become accustomed to the culture here; this is \n\n\n\nwhere I belong. I want to be a contributing member of society, as I have proven in my 13 years.'' As we know, \nBarbara and DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country. We have a little boy here, Aciel. He was a 5-\nyear-old boy. His family brought him to the United States from Mexico. He grew up on the north side of Chicago. \nWe have got a lot of Chicago, a lot of New Jersey here. Aciel was a bright child, but when he learned that he was \nundocumented, his life took a downturn. He was failing his classes and dropped out of high school for 6 months. \nHe wrote: ``I felt that because of my status I had no future. As a result, my grades and attendance plummeted, and I \nstruggled to do anything productive.'' Then, in 2012, President Obama announced DACA and everything changed \nfor him. Here is how Aciel explained it. ``DACA meant I had a future worth fighting for and, because of that, I \nreturned to school and reignited my passion for studying. Because of DACA, I want to do whatever I can to \ncontribute to my country.'' In his senior year in high school, he turned his life around; he improved his grades; very \nactive in the community, head of the school fundraising committee, and volunteered with the mentoring program. \nHe also worked full time to support himself and his family. He is in his sophomore year in Honors College at the \nUniversity of Illinois in Chicago. He has a double major in psychology and political science. He has a perfect 4.0 \ngrade point average. He is involved with student government, and leads a recreational bike club. Every week, he \ndelivers food from the college dining hall to a homeless shelter. He mentors middle school students. He is a part-\ntime security guard at local events. He dreams of working in Chicago city government. He gives hope to people who \nneed it to turn their lives around. Now he wants to give back to the city and country he loves. I do note that we will \nhave an opportunity to hear from the Vice President. Do we have to have the vote here first before Members can \ngo--the floor vote will occur soon after I yield back. I have no intention of yielding back, Mr. Speaker. I have a lot \nmore. Do we know yet if there is any possibility of a Special Order later? We asked about 3 hours ago. There are \nother Members to participate. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harper). The gentlewoman from California is free to \nconsult with leadership on that issue. Ms. PELOSI. Well, that is what we asked earlier, and we had made that \noverture but never did get an answer back. We have been joined by Congresswoman Judy Chu who, as I \nmentioned earlier, is the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a leader fighting for family \nfairness and the issue of family unification in any of our immigration discussions; Congresswoman Nita Lowey, our \nranking member on appropriations and really central to all the discussion this is about, about the appropriations bill \nthat will come back from the Senate. It will come back from the Senate with a promise from their leader, Mitch \nMcConnell, that we would--that they, in the Senate, would have a vote on a DREAMers bill to be debated, and the \nchips will fall where they may. We are simply asking the Speaker for the same opportunity. So I thank Mrs. Lowey \nfor her leadership. Congresswoman Roybal- Allard, as I mentioned earlier, was the original--I called her the \ngodmother--of the DREAM Act. She had the original bill, and then she joined with Senator Durbin in advancing it in \n2001. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, part of our communications group on this [[Page H949]] and other subjects, I \nthank Hakeem Jeffries from New York. Congressman Gonzalez from Texas who knows firsthand the border, the \nchallenges that we face; Congressman Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts, again, a strong supporter, mentioned \nagain in his response to the President. I mentioned Adam Schiff earlier about his being involved in our discussions \nand our earlier meetings today on the subject; and Congresswoman Hanabusa from Hawaii, of course, very \ninvolved in this issue, as you would suspect. So I thank so many of our colleagues for joining here on the floor. I \ndon't know if they have--I have so many more, but I didn't know if they had any. These are from my colleagues. This \nis my stack, but these are from my colleagues; so I will go to those. From Congresswoman Lowey, this is a letter \nfrom a DREAMer to Congresswoman Nita Lowey. ``I want to thank you for your support of DACA. I know you are \ndoing all you can to fight heartless legislation and initiatives that would deport a potential 800,000 young people. I \nam 28 years old, and I am one of the DREAMers, having come to America from El Salvador when I was 15 years \nold. ``I attended school in Ramapo, New York, and now make my home with my wife in Pearl River. Life in El \nSalvador, where I was born, was dangerous and brutal, which is why my father moved us to America in 2005.'' And \nthis is a story we have heard over and over. ``I am grateful every day for all the opportunities presented to me here. \nI currently work as a technology specialist at Apple and feel it is so important to continue achieving, setting goals, \nand giving back to my community.'' {time} 1545 ``It would break my heart to lose my home and life here in New \nYork. ``The prognosis on DACA seems to be changing daily, adding to growing uncertainty. My status expires in \nNovember. ``What will my future be? ``I am reaching out to you to ask if I could meet with you at one of your local \noffices to discuss DACA. ``My employer has offered support and legal assistance. . . .'' That is from Hugo Alexander \nAcosta Mazariego. And as I said earlier, our business community has been superlative in all of this. Representative \nTorres sent a story from Leydy Rangel: ``My name is Leydy Rangel, and I have lived in the United States since I \nwas 8. I am now 22. In June, I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona, where I earned a degree in journalism. I have \n\n\n\nalways known I am undocumented because I remember the first day of elementary school and how kids pointed \nout my brown skin so much.'' I told you my story about that before. Leydy says: ``I know that my parents moving to \nthe States was extremely horrifying and leaving everything behind was difficult, but it makes me feel better knowing \nthat my future here was brighter than the one I could've ever had in Mexico. ``Regardless of not having enough \nfood on the table, not having help on my homework, not having any resources to help me apply to college, I \nmanaged and got accepted to college and moved hours away from home with the purpose of bettering myself and \nmy family.'' This is really the American Dream story over and over again. She references when DACA was created, \nshe had stability, if only temporarily, in America, the only country she knows. By repealing DACA, her hopes and \naspirations were forced into another place. Leydy says: ``I do not have any clear memories of Mexico, and I do not \nknow anyone in Mexico. My entire life is in the United States. Here is where I have made my life for myself, and \ntaking that away from me is inhumane. This Nation is the only one that I aspire to contribute to and the only one I \nbelong to.'' Graciela Nunez is a 22-year-old student, a Washington graduate, who works at a humanitarian law firm. \nShe is a driven person with a desire to give back, and she has big ambitions for the future. She is also a DREAMer \nand DACA recipient who was born in Venezuela. When Graciela was 7 years old, her parents moved. They told \nher that her family was going to the U.S. to visit Disney World on a short vacation. Only as she got off the plane did \nshe realize that she was not going back to Venezuela. They were fleeing the Chavez regime, and they were in the \nUnited States to stay. This is the only country Graciela knows. She, like 1.8 million other DREAMers in this country, \nhas built her life here. She is as American as it gets. A piece of paper could not negate her participation in all of the \nthings that make this country great. Graciela feels little connection to Venezuela. She doesn't know how many \nPresidents that country has had. She is unfamiliar with the geography, but she has got a 5 in AP U.S. history and \nshe can talk about the documents that built this Nation with more detail than any of us. In Graciela's words, she has \nbeen living under constant heightened stress because of the fate of DACA. And we know what that program is \nabout. Graciela says DACA has let people know that undocumented youth have potential. It gives them upward \nsocial mobility and a way out. It allows DREAMers to do exactly what their name implies: to dream for a better life \nand to not let paper limit potential. Jimmy Panetta has sent us a story from Katherine from Salinas. I mentioned \nJimmy earlier and his work in trying to find a bipartisan solution. Katherine says: ``I'm very grateful for all the things \nthis country has done for me, but I think it's not their turn to see what I have done for them, to see everything that \nI've accomplished: the awards, the high GPAs, and all the amazing people that are DACA recipients. The process \nyou have to go through and the strictness to obtain DACA is so hard. If you have just a little detail on your record, \nthat's it, you're out. ``We're some of America's best. And I want to know why they are taking this away from us. \n``Why don't you want us here? Don't you want people with degrees? Don't you want people with cool internships \nand cool jobs? Why don't you want me here? ``Our parents are original DREAMers, and we're here trying to \naccomplish their dreams. Please be able to see that for yourselves.'' So this is that same thing about parents. Mr. \nHoyer has a story from Ivy Teng Lei, a Chinese American DACA recipient raised in Manhattan's Chinatown. She is \nthe youngest of three and became the second to graduate college in her family from Baruch College. Today, she \ncontinues to devote her free time to empowering underserved communities. She chairs the Professional Leadership \nCouncil on Asian American Federation, hosts seminars and workshops on professional and cultural engagement \nactivities. She is now an independent consultant for small business, nonprofits, and immigrant organizations. She \njust devotes so much of her free time to empowering underserved communities. Ivy Teng Lei's story is just what this \ncountry needs. I thank Mr. Hoyer for referring her to us. She is a Chinese American. Jung Bin Cho's family \nemigrated to the United States in 2001 from South Korea. They decided to leave to attain the American Dream for \ntheir children. He enrolled in first grade in Virginia, and, in 2016, proudly graduated from Virginia Tech. Jung Cho \nsays: ``The U.S. is the only home I know. Because of DACA, I worked and could save money to help pay for \ncollege. Where I live in Northern Virginia, you need a car to get anywhere. Because of DACA, I can drive, giving my \nfamily rides or to study.'' Anyway, these are all just very personal stories about the struggles, the obstacles, but the \noptimism, the determination, and the hope that all of these people have. Isn't that what America is about? America \nis about optimism and hope. This one is from Representative Esty about Carolina Bortolleto. She had other \ntestimony earlier. Elizabeth Esty from Connecticut has been a champion on this issue, and she sends this other \ntestimony. Carolina says: ``I was born in Brazil and moved to the U.S. with my family [[Page H950]] and my twin \nsister when I was 9 years old. I came to Connecticut. I knew I was undocumented, and so I'd face a tougher path \nto college, but I made the decision to keep fighting. ``I was able to graduate in top 5 percent of my class and got a \nscholarship to Western Connecticut State University, where I graduated in 2010 with a degree in biology. In 2010, I \ncofounded a local organization working for the rights of undocumented students in Connecticut. ``I was able to buy \n\n\n\nmy first car and obtain a driver's license. At the end of 2014, I suffered a severe medical emergency and spent 8 \nmonths in the hospital. But due to DACA, I was able to get a job that offered health insurance with the national \norganization United We Dream.'' Here we are again with United We Dream. Carolina says: ``Now my DACA expires \non March 2019, and, with it, I will lose my health insurance that I need to live.'' Again, these stories go on and on. I \nthink, really, the point is that these young people have accomplished things that I think many of us would not have \nbeen able to accomplish. Perhaps some. I give everyone credit for obstacles they have overcome. But if you have \nall of the obstacles of economic disadvantage, plus being undocumented, uncertainty in your family, and all the \nemotional unrest that that causes, and to see them in the National Honor Society, the top 1 percent, the top 10 \npercent, the top 5 percent of their classes, giving back, volunteering over and over again in their communities, these \nare the best of the best. They are so fabulous. Again, their parents were so courageous. They had a dream for \ntheir children, and some of these children are now reflecting that they are living their parents' dream for them. And \nthat is what America has always been about. Mr. Speaker, I have plenty more stories to tell. Some of them \nsubmitted by our colleagues, but I know that there is supposed to be a vote sometime soon. Is that correct? Or can \nwe just go on? Mr. Speaker, may I ask what the order of things is here? Do I have just time to go on and on? Or is \nthere a vote being called? Or what? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rice of South Carolina). The House is \ncurrently considering H.R. 1153. Ms. PELOSI. Aldo Solano was at the State of the Union address. He was the \nguest of Congressman Earl Blumenauer. Aldo moved from Mexico when he was 6. He grew up in one of the \nFarmworker Housing Development Corporation's affordable housing communities in Woodburn, Oregon. At 15, he \nstarted volunteering at FHDC's afterschool program and later interned for its Funds Development Department, \ncreating his pathway to a career in community development and a passion for social equity. After graduating from \nWoodburn High School, Aldo became a DACA recipient. He has extensive experience with electoral and \ncommunity- based organizing in areas of farmworkers' rights, immigrants' rights, youth employment, and \neducation. Aldo currently serves as the policy director for the Oregon Latino Health Coalition, where he is part of a \nteam that helped pass State legislation that extends health coverage to undocumented children in Oregon. God \nbless you for that, Aldo. We have been joined by Congressman Eric Swalwell from California, and we thank him for \nhis leadership on this very important issue working with the Future Forum, visiting with DREAMers all over the \ncountry. Also, Keith Ellison joined us, who I referenced earlier his testimony from his constituent in Minnesota as \nwell. Mr. Hoyer has another testimony from Chirayu Patel, an Indian American who arrived here when he was 11 \nyears old. For 23 years he has lived here. He was from Gujarat. Isn't that where the Prime Minister is from in India? \nChirayu has spent years and thousands of dollars to resolve our status. He says: ``However, due to incorrect filing \nby a notary that took advantage of my father's lack of knowledge about U.S. immigration process, our current \nlawyer has said that there is simply no way for us to get right with the law unless there is a change in law by the \nCongress.'' Again, I won't read the whole statement, but Chirayu says: ``Over the years, our family has built a life \nhere and given back to the only country we know as home. My parents have paid income taxes, property taxes, \nand even business taxes. I was also the first person in my family to graduate from college. The introduction of \nDACA in 2012 was a consequential day for me. ``The President's decision to rescind the DACA program was a \npunch in the gut, and I felt the floor disappear under my feet.'' Chirayu says: After 23 years, my life may be \ndestroyed overnight. I continue to raise awareness on this issue by sharing our stories and asking our families, \nfriends, and neighbors to continue pushing Congress. In return, we hope that Congress can deliver. I thank Mr. \nHoyer for submitting that. Mr. Swalwell's testimony is from Jose from Hayward, California. He came to the United \nStates as a child from Mexico. He has only pledged allegiance to the United States of America. He is headed to \ncollege soon and wants to be a police officer in the only country he has called home. Thank you, Mr. Swalwell, for \nbringing that to our attention. Valentina Garcia Gonzalez was only 6 years old when her family brought her to the \nUnited States from Uruguay. She grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. She was a bright child and learned \nEnglish after a few months of college. Valentina says: ``After that, I became my parents' right hand. Everything and \nanything that involved speaking to the outside world meant I was in the front translating and representing my \nparents. It was a lot of responsibility for a young undocumented kid.'' In addition to this responsibility, Valentina \nwas an excellent student. She received the President's Education Award twice, once from President Bush and once \nfrom President Obama. In high school, she was an honors graduate in advanced placement, a leader in student \ngovernment, a member of the Beta Club. Somehow Valentina found time to be the president of the school's \nenvironmental group and manager of the varsity basketball team. They have so many hours in a day, these \nDREAMers. She was a very accomplished student, but Georgia State law bans undocumenteds from attending the \nState's top public universities. As a result, Valentina applied and was accepted to Dartmouth College in Hanover, \n\n\n\nNew Hampshire. Congratulations, Valentina. She is now a sophomore there. To help pay her tuition, she works as a \nprojectionist at a theater, as an undocumented student. She still finds time to volunteer and mentor children. In her \nletter, she wrote: ``I am beyond grateful because, by receiving DACA, the U.S. has given me an opportunity to give \nback to this country that has given me so much. This is my country. I have worked hard to prove myself worthy in \nthe eyes of my American counterparts, and knowing that I am in a weird limbo in regards to my legal status doesn't \nmake me sleep any easier. My name is registered with the government, so I might be deported if they decide to end \nDACA.'' It would be so sad if she were deported back to Uruguay, a country where she hasn't lived since she was 6 \nyears old. I don't think our country would be stronger without that. Oscar Cornejo, Jr., was 5 years old when his \nfamily came to the United States from Mexico. He grew up in Park City, a small northern suburb of Chicago. He \nbecame an excellent student in high school. He was a member of, again, the National Honor Society, and he was \nan Illinois State Scholar. He received several advanced placement awards. He graduated magna cum laude. What \nhe says is: ``My parents always instilled in me the value of an education, which is one of the main reasons they \ndecided to leave everything in Mexico and come to the United States. I dedicate myself to my education to honor \nthe sacrifices my parents made.'' {time} 1600 Because of his outstanding academic achievements, he was \nadmitted to Dartmouth. He is the first member of [[Page H951]] his family to attend college. He excelled at \nDartmouth. During freshman year, he received the William S. Churchill prize for outstanding academic \nachievement. Just absolutely fabulous. Thank you. Thank you for submitting Oscar's story. He says: ``When I \nreceived my DACA, the threat of deportation had been lifted and I felt I could actually achieve my dreams. DACA \nhas allowed me to work for the first time, and the money I earn goes to support my education and my family.'' \nAgain, a valuable asset. Let me just recap a little bit of this, Mr. Speaker. So many of our DREAMers are interested \nin becoming doctors and healthcare professionals, whether it be researchers, nurses, or other healthcare \nprofessionals. I just want to read once again this statement from the Association of American Medical Colleges: The \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges reports that the Nation's doctor shortage will rise to between 40,000 and \n105,000 by the year 2030. Both the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical \nColleges warn that ending DACA will exacerbate this physician shortage in the United States, and they have urged \nCongress to pass legislation to protect DREAMers. Listen to what the AMA says: ``Estimates have shown that the \nDACA initiative could help introduce 5,400 previously ineligible physicians into the U.S. healthcare system in the \ncoming decades to address these shortages and ensure patient access to care. ``Removing those with DACA \nstatus will particularly create care shortages for rural and other underserved areas. . . . Without these physicians, \nthe AMA is concerned that the quality of care provided in these communities would be negatively impacted and that \npatient access to care will suffer.'' That is a quote. They are saying there could be as many as 40,000 to over \ndouble that number by 2030, and 5,400 previously ineligible physicians come to us by making DACA, by passing \nprotection for our DREAMers, 5,400 previously ineligible physicians. That is quite remarkable. So when you see the \nneed and you see the ambition and the vocation and the dedication, especially to help in underserved areas, it is \nquite remarkable. This is another of Senator Durbin's. He wanted to introduce to the Senate a DREAMer from \nSpeaker Ryan's home State of Wisconsin. Her name is Maricela Aguilar. In 1995, when Maricela was 3 years old, \nher mother brought her to the United States with the hope of giving her a chance for a better life. Maricela's family \nsettled in Milwaukee. Maricela worked hard, and she excelled in school. During high school, she was on the honor \nroll and was a member of the National Honor Society--we keep hearing that over and over--and captain of the cross \ncountry team. At the same time, Maricela was active in her community, volunteering at a local homeless shelter. \nWhen it came time to apply for colleges, Maricela knew she wanted to stay close to her family in the only home \nshe'd ever known, Wisconsin. She applied to many local schools and was offered a full-tuition scholarship to \nMarquette University in Milwaukee. At Marquette, Maricela was on the dean's list and was a double major in \npolitical science and English literature. She also worked part-time as a waitress to support herself and her family. \nMaricela became involved in advocating for immigration reform. In December 2010, Maricela was here in the \nSenate gallery, along with hundreds of other DREAMers, when the Senate failed to pass the DREAM Act due to a \nRepublican filibuster. I remind that, just shortly before that, we passed it in the House. It got over 50 votes in the \nSenate, but it did not get to the 60th vote. She came to raise concerns about the DREAMers again and again. She \ngraduated with honors in her graduating class. She is now in graduate school at Brandeis University in Boston. \nShe plans to return to Milwaukee when she graduates. She wants to become a public schoolteacher. Maricela and \nother DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country. Could we use more public schoolteachers like \nMaricela? I think so. Would we be a stronger country if we deported her? I don't think so. So we have another one \nfrom Mr. Durbin. Her name is Naomi Florentino. Her parents brought her to the United States from Mexico when \n\n\n\nshe was 10 years old. Naomi grew up in the town of Smyrna, Tennessee. Naomi was an excellent student and \nactive in her community. In high school, she was a member of the National Honor Society, and she received \nStudent of the Year awards for algebra and art. She served on the student council and played on the varsity soccer \nteam and the varsity track and field team. She was also a shot put and discus thrower. These people are so \naccomplished, I just don't know how many hours they have in the day. Naomi's dream was to become a robotics \nengineer. She participated in the NASA Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academy and \nperformed so well that she won the Next Generation Pioneer Award. She graduated high school with honors, but \nher immigration status limited her. She didn't give up. She took mechanical engineering courses at Lipscomb \nUniversity in Nashville. She then went to community college. In the spring, she is graduating with an associate's \ndegree in mechatronics technology, a field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, \ntelecommunications engineering, control engineering, and computer engineering. Could you do that? Could any of \nus do that? Naomi is now working on her bachelor's degree at Middle Tennessee State University. In her spare \ntime, she is also involved in her community doing all kinds of wonderful things. She says: ``DACA has meant the \nopportunity of a lifetime for my academic and professional career. As a student at Smyrna High School, driving \npast the Nissan plant motivated me to be a better student with hopes of, one day, being part of a company that is \nhighly regarded in my community. However, without proper work authorization, that goal seemed far-fetched. \nToday, it is a reality for me.'' So, hopefully, we can continue to make that a reality for Naomi Florentino, and I submit \nher statement for the Record. I wish I could excuse my colleagues, but they have all been such champions on this \nissue, and their dedication to it is obviously demonstrated here, as it is with some of those who can't be with us right \nnow. This is another story that is about a DREAMer, and I want to tell the story of how DACA has given one \nDREAMer the chance to contribute to the country she loves. This is Maria Ibarra-Frayre. Maria's parents brought \nher to the United States from Mexico at 9 years old. She grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the heartland. She was an \nexcellent student who was dedicated to community service. In high school, she was a member of the National \nHonor Society--you keep hearing that, Mr. Speaker. I have been here all day, but all day you have been hearing \nmembers of the National Honor Society--Key Club, and the school newspaper. She volunteered twice a week \ntutoring middle school students and performed over 300 hours of community service. She graduated with a 3.97 \nGPA and was admitted to the University of Michigan, but was unable to enroll at Michigan because of her \nimmigration status. She entered the University of Detroit Mercy, a private Catholic school. She was elected vice \npresident of the student senate. She helped found Campus Kitchen to take leftover meals to the homeless--not to \nthe homeless, but other people who have a hard time leaving home and needed meals to be brought to them. She \nparticipated in helping elderly couples, homeless people, et cetera, and graduated valedictorian of her class. Her \noptions were limited because of her immigration status. When she got DACA, she wrote: ``DACA means showing \nthe rest of the country, society, and my community what I can do. I have always known what I'm capable of, but \nDACA has allowed me to show others that the investment and opportunity that DACA provides is worth it.'' [[Page \nH952]] Maria and other DREAMers like her have so much to contribute to our country. Will America be a stronger \ncountry if we send Maria away? No, I don't think so, and I think you would agree. Juan Vargas from California. I \nacknowledged him earlier. He is here. Congressman Juan Vargas, 51st Congressional District, would like me to \nread a statement from a constituent, former intern, and a DREAMer: My name is name Jacqueline Olivares. I was \nbrought to the United States at age 2. Now, you know, age 2. I was raised in San Diego and never felt different from \nanyone else. I speak the language and know the culture. I knew I had no papers, but I never really knew what that \nmeant. I didn't realize the importance of those documents until I wanted to go to college. I always knew I wanted to \nmove forward with my education. I was an avid student in high school and was always encouraged to apply to \nuniversities because I had the grades to compete. Then my parents told me that it wasn't a possibility. I realized I \nwas different. I would always ask myself: Why me? But when DACA was announced in 2012, it gave me relief. I am \nproud to call myself a DREAMer. Jacqueline says: I am proud to call myself a DREAMer. DACA gave me hope, \nopportunity, and motivation, and that won't be taken away. My name is Jacqueline Olivares, and DREAMers are \nAmerican, too. I thank Mr. Vargas for that. Another one, from Keith Ellison from Minnesota: Itzel came to the United \nStates when she was only 15 years old. Despite initial language difficulties, she worked hard and graduated from \nhigh school with honors. She completed one semester of college after high school, but economic difficulties forced \nher to focus on work instead. However, when she was granted DACA in 2012, she got a better-paying job, was able \nto go back to college, and graduated with honors. The last 2 years, Itzel has been working for the State of \nMinnesota as a senior court clerk. She bought a house and supports her family. The week before DACA was \nterminated Itzel applied for a job as a probation officer, her dream job, a probation officer. But the elimination of \n\n\n\nDACA now makes that goal appear impossible. Itzel was also planning to start a master's degree in criminal justice \nnext semester. That, too, now seems impossible. Itzel told me, ``I don't want to go back to dreaming of a better \nfuture. I want to be part of a better future for me, for my family, and for my country.'' Again and again, for our \ncountry. I thank Mr. Ellison and Itzel. From Congresswoman Matsui of California, acknowledged earlier, an \nunnamed DREAMer from her district says: ``September 1990 my life would change forever.'' This is her story: ``My \nfamily and I had migrated to the United States. ``The first six years of my life pales in comparison to what I have \nbeen introduced to within a few months of living in the U.S. All I do know is that my clear, joyful memories started \nwhen we moved to America. I was living in the best country in the world, a place I would call my home, and yet I \ndidn't even know it. ``Fast-forward 27 years later, and today my family sit here in deportation proceedings, given 45 \ndays to pack up their lives and leave. The past few weeks have been the most painful, fearful, helpless, and \nhopeless days of my life.'' {time} 1615 ``My parents and sisters are being deported, and I most likely have a few \nmonths left before I will be deported as well. I am considered a DREAMer, probably one of the oldest DREAMers in \nthe United States; had my oldest sister been eligible, she would have been the oldest of us DREAMers. ``However, \nI was the only one of the three to be granted protection with DACA, and now my family has been ordered to leave \nthe United States with a 10-year ban on reentry.'' The 10-year ban on reentry--you are probably familiar with this, \nMr. Speaker--this 10-year ban is just deadly. ``I can't separate from my family and have them do this on their own. \nMy family and I are one cohesive unit--family always stick together, it's what we believe in, so there is no choice but \nto go with my family, to help each other reconstruct what we built here over the last 27 years. At this point, I don't \nknow what to do. What am I supposed to do? We have exhausted all of our options and met failure at each end. All \nI can do is leave it in God's hands, pray for strength and guidance, and hope my prayers are heard with a miracle. \n``I understand that there are those who commit horrible crimes and shouldn't be given the opportunity to stay. \nHowever, for us as a family, we didn't do anything to harm our country. We went to school, educated ourselves, \nhad good jobs, pushed our limits, helped others, are great Samaritans''--there we are with great Samaritan again--\n``pay and paid our taxes, and strive to better ourselves and our country and the community we live in. ``As for my \nfamily and I, no matter the distance, no matter the 10- year ban, no matter what . . . our heart and spirit will always \nbe here in the United States.'' `` . . . the place I call home. I have spent the majority of my life here, and it has \nshaped me into the woman I am now.'' These people are being deported, and that is why we need to have \ncomprehensive immigration reform to address the bigger issue. But we can do something today to at least make \nwhole the children. This is another one, a Sacramento State graduate that Congresswoman Matsui submitted to us. \nShe said that DACA gave him peace of mind. He currently holds a master's degree and plans to pursue a doctoral \ndegree. He wants to work in the field of education and is worried that the President's decision to rescind DACA will \nlead to less people becoming teachers. He said that he believes ``there is something good in all of us.'' Oswaldo \ndeserves to continue to fulfill his dreams in his community. Gustavo, also from Sac State, came to the United States \nat the age of 7 with his brothers and parents. He said: ``I am happy to say that my parents' courage and \nwillingness to risk it all for their children's future was worth it.'' Gustavo recently graduated from Sacramento State \nwith a bachelor's in psychology and a minor in counseling and would like to pursue a master's degree. Gustavo \nsaid: ``We as DREAMers are here to build a better society, to change the cycle of our family's struggles, to better \nourselves, to help build bridges amongst society and to be educated individuals with the hunger of striving for a \nbetter tomorrow.'' Another from Congresswoman Matsui. Jesus is a DREAMer and DACA recipient from \nSacramento who was brought to this country by his mother at the age of 8. He is also a full-time English professor \nat Sacramento City College and part-time lecturer at Sacramento State University. He has devoted himself to the \nclassroom, oftentimes working with young DREAMers. He said: ``I am honored to have the opportunity to teach the \nyouth of my community, to empower the reentry students, and to help improve the culture of both local campuses \nwho gave me an education.'' Juana from Congresswoman Matsui's district: ``DACA has allowed me to feel \nprotected from being deported, to feel accepted and acknowledged in this country we grew up in and love. My \nDACA status has provided me the opportunity to pursue my dreams like many other people. ``Thanks to DACA, I \nwas able to work and go to school. I just recently graduated from Sacramento State, this spring 2017, with my B.A. \nin sociology. I graduated from high school in 2006 and had to put my dreams aside because I was not able to \ncontinue my education; but once I got DACA status, I was able to go to a university. Now that I just graduated and \nwould like to start my career, it would be horrible if my status was rescinded. ``I've been in the U.S. for 27 years. I \nhave never left America. I was born in Mexico but have no clue what it is like. The only place I know is California. \nThis is my home and all I know.'' From Representative Lofgren, whom I mentioned earlier, who has been such a \nchampion on the Judiciary Committee on this, a former chair of the [[Page H953]] Immigration and Border Security \n\n\n\nSubcommittee. She has taught immigration law. She has been an immigration lawyer. She knows it all. She has just \nbeen a tremendous leader and very dedicated advocate and champion. She submits this from Ms. Mandy Lau: ``I \nwanted to take a moment to express my frustration with the repeal of DACA. As an educator, I have seen how \nDACA has improved the lives of the students and families in our community here in San Jose. DACA has been a \nresounding success, and this administration should not end this crucial program. Nearly 800,000 young men and \nwomen have been able to contribute to their communities, to work, go to school, and to live their lives without fear \nof being ripped away from their families and from a country they consider home. Ms. Lau, Mandy that is, went on to \nsay: ``Recently, I held a crying student who was disheartened that although she worked hard to maintain her 4.0 \nGPA throughout high school, fought stereotypes of gang affiliation, and resisted negative influences to create \nbetter opportunities for herself and her family, there would also be a possibility that her dream of attending college \nwould no longer be an option. She asked me how this was possible in the land of the free, how quickly an \nopportunity could be stripped from a person with ambition, hopes, and dreams. DACA has given these young adults \na lifeline and hope for the future. Ending the program would be devastating for DREAMers and their families. \nWithout DACA, these 800,000 DREAMers would be subject to deportation to countries they may not even \nremember and no longer able to work legally to support themselves and their families''--in the place they call home, \nMandy says. ``I have spent the majority of my life here. It shaped me into the woman I am.'' So I thank the lady very \nmuch. These are beautiful, beautiful statements from some of these DACA recipients, from our DREAMers, but it is \neven beyond those who are recipients. Two brothers, Jhon Magdaleno and Nelson, his brother. Let me tell you \nabout Nelson and Jhon. These brothers came to the United States from Venezuela when Nelson was 11 and Jhon \nwas 9. They are both honor students at Lakeside High School in Atlanta, Georgia. Here is a picture of Nelson. Jhon \nserved with distinction in the Air Force Junior Officer Reserve Corps. He was the fourth highest ranking in a 175-\ncadet unit and commander of the Air Honor Society in his unit. Here is a picture of Jhon in his ROTC uniform. They \nwent on to both become honor students at Georgia Tech University--Nelson in computer engineering, Jhon in \nbiomedical engineering with a 4.0. In 2012, he graduated from Georgia Tech with honors. Do you understand being \ngraduated with honors from Georgia Tech in computer engineering, and Jhon in a biomedical engineering major \nfrom Georgia Tech, and they have 3.6 GPA and 4.0 GPA? Thanks to DACA, they have been working as computer \nengineers for a Fortune 500 semiconductor company. Jhon received DACA in 2012, while he was still a student at \nGeorgia Tech. He then worked for 2 years as a researcher in a biomedical engineering lab at Georgia Tech \nresearching glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. In 2014, Jhon graduated from Georgia Tech with a major in \nchemical and biological engineering with highest honors--highest honors in chemical and biological engineering \nfrom Georgia Tech. He is now working as a process engineer with a Fortune 500 company, too. Both have written \nletters. Nelson wrote: ``To me, DACA means an opportunity to be able to live my dreams and contribute to society \nin ways that I could not have imagined. DACA means that one of my life goals, owning my own company, could be \na possibility in the future. DACA means a chance. DACA means the American Dream.'' Jhon wrote: ``I consider an \nAmerican to be someone who loves and wholeheartedly dedicates themselves to the development of this country. \nFrom age 9, I have made the United States my home, and it has made me the man I am today. I proudly call myself \nan American.'' As I read some of these stories, you hear a recurring theme. Again, it is a theme about honoring the \nvows of our Founders for a new order for the ages that every generation would take the responsibility to make the \nfuture better for future generations. That is exactly what the families of these DREAMers did. Family members took \nrisks, had courage, hope, optimism, and determination to make the future better for their families. Doing that for \ntheir families, they were doing that for America, too. You see such a similarity to previous generations. I see it as an \nItalian American--education, education, education, the key to upward mobility. Talent, talent, talent, but not \nunderutilized; educated to reach its full potential to reach the aspirations of these young people to do so in a way \nthat is about giving back. What you see here is what our families were all about that had come before, that idealism \nand hope springs in optimism and aspirations of immigrants coming to our country. That is why I always say that \nwe are a great country because we are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country. Their \ncourage and commitment to the American Dream which drew them here in the first place strengthens the American \nDream. These newcomers with all of that hope and aspiration make America more American when they come here. \nThat is why our country will not stagnate. That is why our country will continue to blossom, to respect our traditions, \nour past, and our sense of community. In every one of these letters there is gratitude back to the United States for \nwhat it has done for these people. There is no sense of entitlement. It is all about working hard and paying back. \nThat is why if we can just do this piece which has urgency to it because it has a timetable that the President has put \nforth, just doing this piece would be the smart thing to do, to find a solution that then builds trust in a bipartisan way \n\n\n\nwith transparency and openness as to what it actually is about. That is why we want people to know this is who \nthese people are. That is why they are called DREAMers. That is why the name has persisted. We have been the \ncountry of the American Dream forever. Yes, I agree with the President. We are all DREAMers in America. This is \npart of the future. Of course, I think of my grandchildren as the future. They didn't have to face the struggles that \nthese young people are facing. God bless them for their courage to make the struggle, but it is, again, faith, family, \nfaith in the future, faith in America, faith in themselves, faith which gives people hope, hope because they have faith \nin the kindness of others. Faith, hope, charity, and hope is right there in the middle. I think that people who have \nhope, much of it springs from their faith, and these clearly are people of great faith. That is why the Conference of \nCatholic Bishops welcomes them. That is why the evangelical community speaks so clearly and passionately about \nthe need to protect them. These are precious gems. They are absolutely outstanding, and they write their stories so \neloquently that nothing any of us can say about the subject is to even compare to the power of their stories. For \nexample, Johana was brought to the United States from Venezuela when she was a child. She grew up in Boulder, \nColorado. She played in her high school softball team, played viola in the orchestra, and dreamed of becoming a \ndoctor. Here is what Johana said about her childhood: ``I've become a Boulderite in all aspects of that word. That \ntown, with those beautiful mountains, is truly my home.'' In 2011, Johana graduated from the University of Colorado \nat Boulder with a double major in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology and psychology neuroscience. \nThey are so talented. But after graduating from college, Johana was unable to pursue her dream of becoming a \ndoctor because she was undocumented. Then in 2012, with DACA, she heard that Loyola University in Chicago \nwould accept students who had received DACA into its medical schools. I thank Loyola University and the \nUniversity of Chicago. Like many States across the country, Illinois faces a shortage of physicians in some \ncommunities. The Loyola University DACA program sees this as an opportunity to address the problem. The State \nof Illinois has created a [[Page H954]] DACA loan program. Under this program, Loyola DACA med students can \nreceive loans to help cover the cost of their medical education. For every year of loans, the DACA student must \nwork a year in a medically underserved area in Illinois--again giving back. {time} 1630 Last fall, Johana went to med \nschool at Loyola. After graduating, she will stay in Illinois and help serve parts of Illinois that have a shortage of \ndoctors. This is, of course, one of Senator Durbin's constituents. Here is what Johana had to say: ``When the year \n2012 came along, my life changed. My dreams of becoming a doctor became a possibility again because of DACA. \nI am now able to apply to medical internship programs, take the medical school entrance exam, and apply to \nmedical school, all because of my DACA status. DACA has defined my path. DACA has relit a fire within to \nsucceed and to continue to pursue my dreams.'' Will America be a stronger country if we deport Johana? I don't \nthink so. This is Everardo Arias. Everardo was brought to the United States from Mexico in 1997 when he was 7 \nyears old. Just imagine these adorable children. He grew up in Costa Mesa, California, and was an excellent \nstudent. He dreamed of becoming a doctor. A doctor, again. It was not until he applied to college that Everardo \nlearned that he was undocumented. He was accepted at the University of California, Riverside, but because of his \nimmigration status, however, Everardo didn't qualify for any Federal assistance. When Everardo was a sophomore, \nhe met with a counselor, who told him he had no chance of becoming a doctor because he was undocumented. \nBut Everardo didn't give up on his dream. In 2012, he graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a \nchemistry major and research honors. Shortly after he graduated, DACA was established. He received DACA. He \nworked for a year as a mentor for at-risk students in his hometown of Costa Mesa. The following year, through \nAmeriCorps, he worked as a health educator with several local clinics. He gave classes to hundreds of people in \nboth English and Spanish on topics ranging from diabetes to family nutrition to depression. During his year as a \nhealth educator, he applied and was accepted in medical school. He is currently in his first year at the Loyola \nUniversity Chicago School of Medicine. In his free time, he volunteers at a local clinic. He takes time to teach \nmedical Spanish to some of his classmates. Here is what he had to say about DACA: ``DACA changed my life. It \nopened the door to the future ahead of me. If it weren't for DACA, I would not be here and I probably would not \nhave pursued medicine. I'm blessed to have the opportunity to do what I love to do and to give back to the country \nthat has given me so much.'' Will America be a stronger country if we deport Everardo Arias and others like him? Of \ncourse not. This is from Congresswoman Diana DeGette, who is with us. This is her story from Colorado: Marco \nDorado was born in Mexico and moved to Denver's Globeville neighborhood at the age of 3. After attending \nThornton High School as a student in the International Baccalaureate program, Marco attended the University of \nColorado Boulder and graduated as student body president with a degree in finance. During his time at University of \nColorado, Marco received DACA, which has allowed him to begin his professional career while contributing back to \nhis community. Currently, Marco is the program coordinator for the Latino Leadership Institute at the University of \n\n\n\nDenver. It is a beautiful story, once again demonstrating not only a commitment to education, but a commitment to \ngive back, become doctors, whatever, but leadership. Every one of these has leadership, whether it is leadership in \nthe student government, leadership in community activity, leadership on the sports field, leadership in every \npossible way in extracurricular activities and the rest. Certainly, Marco has demonstrated that trait typical of our \nDREAMers. We have been joined by Ted Lieu from California and Ms. Bordallo from Guam. I think we have \nacknowledged so many Members who have come and gone. I thank them all for their ongoing support of our \nDREAMers. This is from an unknown DREAMer to Brad Sherman. It says: ``I am writing this letter to you because I \nam fearful of what might happen next. I am a Canadian who was brought here when I was 11 years old. I am 28 \nnow and DACA has allowed me to come out of the shadows.'' You hear that expression, ``come out of the \nshadows.'' ``I have worked hard my whole life. I am a senior at UCLA majoring in civil engineering. I am an \nengineering intern at the City of Stanton, and I also work at an animal emergency hospital on weekends. I often \ntime go weeks where I do not have a day off.'' I love this recurring animal assistance, too, that we hear. ``All I ask \nfor is a fair shake, and with this new administration, I fear I won't be given that. I am not a criminal. I am not a \ndanger to my community, nor am I someone trying to take advantage of public benefits. I am a victim to a situation I \nhad no say over. I want to do my share: pay taxes, inspire others, and any other help I can provide. ``Congressman, \nthank you for your time and for listening.'' I thank Brad for submitting this enthusiastic statement from an unknown \nDREAMer from his district, a Canadian. This is from Ted Lieu. I thank him for being here. To Ted Lieu, a testimonial \nfrom Representative Lieu's district: My name is Nicole, and I am a student at UCLA. My parents brought me to the \nUnited States when I was 3 years old. For the 16 years that I have lived in the United States, I grew up like any \nother U.S. citizen. I finished my K-12 schooling, and I volunteered around my community. For my first year of \ncollege, I was fortunate enough to receive a substantial amount of financial aid from both UCLA and the California \nDream Act. This aid alleviated my parents from the fiscal burden of paying for college. Although my tuition was \ncovered, my parents still had to pay out of pocket to cover the expense of living on campus. The scholarship \nmoney I received for my sophomore year was steadily decreased, which means there was more pressure on my \nparents to keep up with the growing cost. To lighten this load, I acquired a full-time summer job. I have become \ndependent on my job and my paycheck to pay off my school, but how do I remain debt free if DACA is rescinded? \nTerminating DACA would turn my world upside down, it will undo the progress I have made at UCLA and challenge \nmy access to higher education. Nicole goes on to say: Although I am grateful for the opportunities I have been \ngiven under DACA, like a Social Security number and relief from deportation, I cannot reconcile that the very \ngovernment I one day hope to work for continues to exclude me from living the American Dream. The President and \nU.S. legislators need to look beyond their biases and stand up for the children who have continuously pledged \nallegiance to the only country they have ever called home. I thank Ted Lieu for Nicole's beautiful story. Mr. Lieu also \nsubmitted testimony from Martin. Martin says, Mr. Speaker: My name is Martin and I grew up in an undocumented \nhousehold. When I was in grade school, I loved listening to the news with my father. It became a daily routine to \ntune in to Univision or television after both of our days of work. It was extremely difficult for me to comprehend \nmany issues discussed on mainstream news, mainly because I generally didn't understand the content. However, \none particular word was mentioned almost every day, ``deportation.'' I had asked my father what it meant, but he \nrefused to answer, and so did my mother. After hearing the cold, hard truth from my teacher in grade school, I felt \nvulnerable for the first time in my life. As I grew older, I became more and more concerned. I walked to school \nevery day worried that my parents might unexpectedly be taken away from me. How many times have we heard \nthat story? Two hardworking parents that had lived and contributed to this country for more than 30 years might be \nforcibly removed from the United States. Now, I have never felt more fearful for the future of my family. That word \n``fear'' is terrifying, tears in the eyes of the Statue of Liberty, fear in the hearts of people who should be able to just \nmake their contribution to our country. [[Page H955]] Hakeem Jeffries submits this testimony from Ashelle. Let me \njust once again thank my colleagues for being here. I wish you could be reading these stories. I feel very privileged \nto be reading so many of them, but the rules are that I cannot yield on the special 1 minute. This is Ashelle King's \nstory: ``I came to the United States from St. Lucia in the Caribbean at the age of 7, and I've been living in Brooklyn \nfor 16 years. I currently attend Baruch College, where I pay tuition out of my pocket by working because I am not \neligible for certain types of aid for school. ``I am studying computer information systems and political science, and I \nwant to apply my studies to help people. I try to be involved in the community, which is why I interned in Mr. Jeffries' \noffice.'' I again thank Mr. Jeffries for this testimony. ``I felt like Mr. Jeffries had a real connection with the people, \nand I wanted to learn how I can assist and give back in that regard. Hopefully, I will be graduating in the spring. I \ndon't want to be fearful of not graduating or of leaving school because DACA ends. ``Fixing DACA is important to \n\n\n\nme because I would not have been able to work if it weren't for DACA. Because I have a working permit, I am able \nto pay for school and be exposed to more things in the U.S. You know, I've been here since a very young age, so I \ndon't know much about St. Lucia. I grew up in Brooklyn. I know more about Brooklyn, and I want to stay here.'' I \nknow that is music to the ears of Hakeem Jeffries, who is always bragging about Brooklyn. And, by the way, so is \nthe Democratic leader in the Senate. Mr. Schumer is always singing the praises of Brooklyn. This is from Mr. \nDurbin. This is Pablo da Silva. Pablo was brought to the United States from Brazil in 2001, when he was 13 years \nold. He grew up in New Jersey. Here is what Pablo has to say about his childhood: ``The same as every other kid \ngrowing up in the U.S., I attended middle school, pledged allegiance to the American flag, and sang the national \nanthem. As I grew older, I came to understand that one thing about me differed from my classmates. I was \nundocumented. However, my parents always taught me to see barriers as a measure of perseverance and an \nopportunity to thrive.'' Pablo was an excellent student. He dreamed of becoming a doctor. During high school and \ncollege, Pablo volunteered at a nursing home every week. He also was a member of a group called Doctor Red \nNose. Pablo and other members of the group would dress up as clowns and visit hospitals and nursing homes to \ncheer up patients and healthcare providers. Pablo was accepted at Rutgers University, but because he was \nundocumented, he didn't qualify financially. You have heard that sentence over and over. And although he grew \nup in New Jersey, he would have been required to pay out-of-state tuition. As a result, Pablo couldn't afford to \nattend Rutgers and instead enrolled in community college. Because he had taken college courses when he was in \nhigh school, Pablo was able to complete a 2-year associate's degree in only 1 year. With his associate's degree, \nPablo was able to transfer to Kean University in New Jersey. In 2011, Pablo graduated at the top of his class with a \nmajor in biology, summa cum laude. He received an award for the highest grade point average in the biology \ndepartment. He was on the dean's list every semester of college and was a member of the honor society Phi Kappa \nPhi. After graduating from college, he was unable to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor. Instead, he worked in \na variety of manual labor jobs. Then, in 2012, President Obama established DACA. Pablo heard that Loyola \nUniversity of Chicago accepts students that receive DACA. Like many States across the country, Illinois faces a \nshortage of physicians in some communities. Loyola University's DACA program is an opportunity to address this \nproblem. I have described this problem again and again, but let me say the State of Illinois has created a DACA \nloan program. Under this program, Loyola's DACA med students can receive loans to cover the costs of their \nmedical education. For every year of loan, the students must work for a year in a medically underserved area in \nIllinois. I said that earlier, but I just want people to know how creative people have become in not only helping \neducate, alleviate the cost, but serve the community. As a result, some of the best and brightest students in the \ncountry have come to Loyola to get a medical education. They will stay in Illinois to help serve parts of the State \nthat have a shortage of doctors. {time} 1645 And then more on Pablo. Last fall, Pablo da Silva began med school \nat Loyola. He is pursuing his dream to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. This is what he had to say: ``DACA has \nallowed me to fulfill my long- lasting aspiration to pursue a career in medicine. It has truly changed my future, and \nfor that, I'm truly grateful. I'm eager to contribute my share to the country I call my own.'' Thank you, Pablo. This is \nKaren Villagomez. Karen was brought to the United States when she was only 2 years old. She grew up in Chicago, \nIllinois. She is an outstanding student and interested in public service. In May 2012, Karen graduated from the \nUniversity of Rochester in New York with a major in political science. She is the first person in her family to \ngraduate from a 4-year college. Just 1 month after she graduated, President Obama announced the DACA \nprogram. After she received DACA, Karen found a job as a paralegal in a law firm in Chicago, where she has been \nworking for the last 2 years. This fall, she will begin law school. How about that? But if the House of \nRepresentatives have--if we could pass this bill, she would be able to attend law school and become an attorney. \nInstead, she could be deported back to Mexico, a country she hasn't lived in since she was a toddler. Here is what \nKaren had to say: ``DACA represents the values and heritage of this country of immigrants; it was the right thing to \ndo, and it has changed my life by replacing fear with hope. This executive action gave me an overwhelming sense \nof relief and hope. It lifted me from the shadows.'' I just want to repeat her first sentence: ``DACA represents the \nvalues and heritage of this country of immigrants; it was the right thing to do, and it has changed my life by \nreplacing fear with hope.'' Now, will America be strong if Karen is deported? No, I don't think so. This one is from \nRepresentative Foster. Mr. Foster is also from Illinois, and this was his State of the Union guest, Ana Campa \nCastillo. She is a student at Joliet Junior College in Joliet, Illinois. Ana is a graduate of Bolingbrook High School \nand is currently pursuing an associate's degree in psychology at Joliet Junior College. She serves as the vice \npresident of Latinos Unidos, one of the largest student organizations. I had the occasion to meet her when \nRepresentative Foster brought her to the State of the Union. I wish more Members of Congress could meet more of \n\n\n\nthese DREAMers. Aren't you impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on our country, each of them \nwith their individual contribution to the greatness of America? So exciting. I am so proud of them. Representative \nPolis' State of the Union guest was Anarely, a student at the Colorado State University in Fort Collins. She was a \nguest of Jared Polis. Anarely was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and came to the United States when she was a \nyoung child. Her family stayed in Colorado to care for her grandmother, who suffered from breast cancer. Anarely \nhas flourished in Colorado, graduating high school with a 4.3 GPA, where she participated in Reserve Officers' \nTraining Corps. She went on to thrive at Colorado State University, triple majoring in political science, ethnic \nstudies, and international relations. I thank Representative Polis and Representative Foster for their very \ndistinguished guests at the State of the Union address. I did mention to the President, when I welcomed him to the \nCapitol, that we [[Page H956]] had many DREAMers and supporters of DREAMers in the audience here, also \nsupporters of fairness for Mexico. So I hope we are doing better as far as our negotiations go in terms of Puerto \nRico. I see we have been joined by Congressman Mark DeSaulnier from California. Thank you for being here, \nMark, as well. Arisaid Gonzalez Porras was a guest of Raul Grijalva. Arisaid came to the United States in 2000 from \nMexico and currently resides in Arizona. That is the State that Raul Grijalva represents in Congress. Arisaid is a \nfreshman at Georgetown University. As a first-generation student, she relied on the help of counselors and teachers \nto help apply to college. Growing up undocumented, she lived in fear of what would happen to her and her family. \nIn her first semester in college, Arisaid has become more outspoken about her status as a DACA recipient and \nbecame an advocate for the rights of the undocumented youth. As a student with the privilege to go to school \nright in the center of politics, she plans to continue her advocacy until Congress passes DREAMers legislation. \nHopefully, Arisaid, that will be very soon. Here are some testimonies from other Members of Congress. Leticia \nHerrera-Mendez is a student at California State University, San Bernardino she was a guest of Congressman Pete \nAguilar from California at the State of the Union address. Congressman Aguilar is a cosponsor with Congressman \nHurd from Texas of the legislation that has strong bipartisan support in the Congress and one bill that we would \nhope that the Speaker would give us an opportunity to vote on the floor of the House. I thank Congressman Aguilar. \nLeticia Herrera-Mendez was born in Mexico and arrived in the United States at the age of 8. She is a DREAMer and \na student at California State University, San Bernardino. In June 2019, she will obtain a bachelor's degree in \nsociology and two certificates, one in Spanish public services and another in social services. She is committed to \nhelping and spreading awareness about the Latino community. She is an immigrant activist and is the vice \npresident of the student organization, Undocumented Advocates at Cal State University, San Bernardino, where \nshe advocates for the rights of undocumented immigrants. Her work and dedication to her community has \ngranted her the opportunity to serve as the California delegat for Fuerza Migrante National Political Group and \nstudent assistant of the Undocumented Student Success Center at CSUSB. Again, leadership, leadership, \nleadership. Education, leadership, how beautiful. Leslie Martinez is a student at UC Irvine, and she was a guest of \nCongressman Lou Correa at the State of the Union. Leslie Martinez is a freshman in college who is passionate \nabout her studies. She was brought to the United States at the age of 2. Growing up, she was alone most of the \ntime due to her parents always working, but this allowed her to become independent at a very young age. She \nfound out she was undocumented during middle school, when she was trying to apply for a scholarship but \nneeded a Social Security number. Luckily, DACA came around during her high school years, opening several \nopportunities for her, such as an internship at UCI Medical Center, where she--that would be University of \nCalifornia, Irvine--where she was able to shadow medical professionals, and it opened up her love for the medical \nfield. DACA also made her college application a smooth process. Now she is a freshman in college and is \npassionate about, again, her studies. She attends the University of California, Irvine, and is majoring in chemistry. \nLeslie hopes to attend medical school after college in hopes of becoming a general surgeon or a pediatrician. \nAgain, doctors, doctors, doctors. Maybe she could find out about Loyola University School of Medicine. Maybe she \nwill have many more options by then, hopefully, when we pass this legislation. Karen Bahena was a State of the \nUnion guest of Congressman Scott Peters. Karen lived in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico, for 8 years, until 2001, \nwhen her family migrated to San Diego. Thanks to DACA, Karen has been able to graduate college with a degree in \npublic health and nutrition at San Diego State University, find work as a research coordinator at the University of \nCalifornia, San Diego, and pursue her dreams in the field of medicine. She hopes to one day help underprivileged \ncommunities with healthcare needs. God bless you, Karen. Again, another example, universally, giving back, giving \nback, giving back. State of the Union guest of Judy Chu, Jung Bin Cho and his family immigrated to the United \nStates when he was 7 years old from South Korea. Thanks to DACA, Jung Bin Cho was able to work and save \nmoney that allowed him to graduate from Virginia Tech with a bachelor's degree in business information \n\n\n\ntechnology. Currently, he is an Immigrant Rights Fellow at the National Korean American Service & Education \nConsortium--this is quite an acronym, NAKASEC, National Korean American Service & Education Consortium--\norganizing and advocating for economic, social, and racial justice for all, with a focus on Asian American and Pacific \nCoast Islander communities. His dream is to attend law school in order to help his community in Virginia. Thank \nyou, Jung. The guest of Gerry Connolly, Nicolle Uria, she spoke at our press conference that we had before the \nState of the Union. I made a joke with Gerry Connolly because somebody there referenced him as Congressman \nCannoli. So I welcomed him with great pride of being an Italian American, but he is Connolly. Nicolle moved to the \nUnited States from La Paz, Bolivia, at the age of 1 with both of her parents and her sisters. For her entire life, she \nhas lived here. The United States is her home. Nicolle grew up living the American Dream just like any other \nAmerican citizen. She celebrated the same traditions, ate the same food, enjoyed from the same activities as any of \nmy other friends. Throughout her education, she has always been a good student and always very active with not \njust school activities, but also with the community. She has been a Girl Scout since the age of 4, she has played \nboth soccer and volleyball for many years, and now as a high school student. Nicolle spent many hours \nvolunteering in the community and getting involved with organizations such as the DREAM Project, LULAC, \nUnidosUS, and many more. After finding out that she was undocumented, she thought all her hard work and effort \nwas for nothing. But then, thanks to President Obama, she was able to apply for DACA. And she told her story very \nbrilliantly at our press conference before the State of the Union. Really, if you could hear them tell their own stories, \nthere is a great humility about conveying their stories to you. Because when you see them and they tell their stories \nand the passion and the pride and just the patriotism--passion, pride, patriotism--that they demonstrate, you will see \nwhy anyone, who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our DREAMers, \nunderstands why they have had such a high reputation among the American people: some of them who have met \nthem, some of them who have heard about them, some of them who have just caught the spark, recognize, again, \nthe hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of \nAmerica. It is a beautiful thing. It just isn't, let's take a small number of people and try to do something with it. This is \nsomething very, very special, and it says a lot about our country to be able to give protection in a way that has \nsome certainty to our DREAMers. Itayu Torres is a student at Pasadena City College. She was a guest at the State \nof the Union of Congressman Jimmy Gomez. Itayu Torres came to the United States from Mexico as a 6-month-old \nbaby. She was completely carried into this country. She learned she was undocumented when she was 14 years \nold and, in 2014, became eligible to apply for DACA. Earning DACA protections has allowed Itayu to access a \ngovernment-issued ID [[Page H957]] card, work authorization, healthcare and protection from deportation. With \nDACA, Itayu had the opportunity to travel across the country. She is currently studying political science and \nbusiness at Pasadena City College and plans to continue her education at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland. A \nwonderful school. Itayu was part of the California Dream Network Steering Committee and one day hopes to run \nfor a seat in the United States Senate. You go, girl. United States Senate. Why not President? Well, she wasn't \nborn here, so she can't be President of the United States. Again, Gabriela Hernandez was a State of the Union \nguest of our great Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. Gabriela, 19, is a college student at Prince George's Community \nCollege. She came here with her mother from El Salvador at the age of 4. Her goal is to transfer to a four-year \nuniversity in the fall, study to be a social worker, and just have an opportunity to thrive. She has lived her entire life \nin this country, having attended schools in Prince George's County since kindergarten. Because many family \nmembers already live here, she doesn't have a lot of family left in her home country. The country she came from is \nEl Salvador. And the situation probably has only gotten worse there since she came. In any event, I thank Mr. \nHoyer for giving us her story. {time} 1700 Mr. Frank Pallone, who spent a lot of time with us, it seems like 6 or 7 \nhours ago, in the beginning of this, he was with us early in the presentation, and his guest at the State of the Union \nwas Esder Chong, a student at Rutgers University-Newark. When Esder was 6 years old, she and her family \nimmigrated to the States from South Korea. Unfortunately, after the 2008 economic recession, her mom lost her \nposition working at a hospital and they lost their legal status. Esder first realized the implications of having an \nundocumented status when her mom got into a bike accident. It was an emergency situation and she needed \ntreatment. However, because they were uninsured, she treated herself through home remedies and prayer. Fast \nforward one decade, Esder is now a sophomore at Rutgers University-Newark on a full ride thanks to private, \nexternal scholarships and donors, including thedream.us and twenty others. She currently serves as the \nfounder/president of RU Dreamers, a Rutgers University-Newark student organization that advocates for \nundocumented students' rights to higher education. Esder is also a student-athlete competing for the Rutgers \nUniversity-Newark cross country/track and field team and the news editor for Rutgers University-Newark Newark \n\n\n\nnewspaper, the Observer. How many hours does Esder have in a day? I would like to know. I want to talk about my \nown guest at the State of the Union. I am so proud of her. Melody Klingenfuss. She is a statewide organizer for \nCHIRLA's California Dream Network. I am so proud of them. And Angelica Salas heads up the organization. They \nhave done so much to protect our DREAMers to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform. Melody was at \nour press conference. I am proud of her. Melody was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala. After growing up without \npardons, she was reunited with her mother in the heart of Los Angeles when she was 9 years old. Can you just \nimagine. She earned her bachelor's degree in communications and political science at California State University, \nLos Angeles. She graduated with a master of nonprofit leadership and management from the University of Southern \nCalifornia. She has conducted a research thesis focused on the representation of undocumented students in mass \ncommunication. Melody works as CHIRLA's California Dream Network statewide youth organizer as a devoted \nadvocate for human and immigration rights. She is a DACA recipient since 2015. Her life goal is to continue \nbending the arc of the moral universe towards justice. I just got word that the House Historian confirmed: ``You \nhave now set the record for the longest continuous speech in the House since at least 1909.'' I wonder what that \nwas. This is Congresswoman Watson Coleman, who spent so much time with us here today. I want to read from \nher testimony. Parthiv Patel from Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Parthiv is a DREAMer who has been in the DACA \nprogram since 2012 and graduated from Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law in May 2016. Parthiv \nwas brought to the United States when he was 5 years old and has lived in the United States continuously since \nthen. He was admitted to the New Jersey State Bar on January 24, 2018. Congratulations, Parthiv. He was \npreviously admitted to the Pennsylvania State Bar on December 18, 2017. He is the first DREAMer admitted to the \nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania bars. When Parthiv's DACA status expires on August 9, 2018, he could be deported \nfrom the only country he knows and ripped away from his family. Even if he is not picked up for deportation, without \nwork authorization or legal status, his employment options and his ability to put his law degree to use serving the \ncommunity will also be substantially limited. Parthiv wants to make sure White House Chief of Staff Kelly knows that \nhe is far from lazy--he should just look at his college and law school records. Thank you, Congresswoman Bonnie \nWatson Coleman. This is from Congresswoman Susan Davis from California. This is the story of her constituent, \nItso. Itso says: I just graduated from high school 3 days before Deferred Action on DACA arrivals was announced, \nand already been accepted to San Diego State University. I wasn't sure if I would be able to afford going to college. \nBut there is some uncertainty in applying for DACA, but it was a risk worth taking. After DACA, I was very \nenthusiastic to be able to work, serve my community, and attend San Diego State University. I graduated this year \nwith a political science degree. As a border resident, I have seen the toll that harsh immigration enforcement has \ntaken in my community. Many times, in the midst of the rhetoric, we lose sight of the real impact that harsh \nenforcement has on the lives of hardworking families. My work with the community is deeply rewarding. I have been \npart of helping thousands of San Diegans, and I have also seen the suffering that many families have to go \nthrough because there are failed and inhumane immigration policies. I remain fully committed to continuing to \nserve my community and ensure that we continue to build a movement that affords immigrants, refugees, and \ncitizens alike the right to live with dignity in the United States. How beautiful. These statements themselves are so \nbeautiful. I don't know who made that speech in 1909, or other speeches competed for the longest in the meantime, \nthat was not my goal today. But we have so many testimonies, real testimony in the words of the DREAMers, as I \nsay, the most eloquent of all. I did ask my staff to say that when I came to the floor earlier, I wanted to make sure \nthat we were filling our 40 hours between 8 this morning and tomorrow night with the words to convince or the \nprayers to inspire. So I thought when I came to the floor, I would be like reading the Bible, because the Bible is so \nfraught with so many passages that take us to a higher place to have a conversation about human beings, all of \nGod's children, at a higher place. Again, referencing the 40 days in the Old Testament, the 40 years in the desert in \nthe New Testament, the 40 days, the Gospel of Matthew, which is so, so beautiful in terms of its inspiration. But I \nknow that many people quote the Gospel of Matthew many times. But they always just quote the first part where \nthey talk about when I was hungry. In the Gospel of Matthew, most people know when a person comes before the \nLord, he says: We have a place for you in Heaven, for when I was hungry, you fed me, when I was thirsty, you gave \nme a drink, when I was naked, you clothed me, when I was in prison, you visited me. That whole list of corporal \nworks of mercy. And then the person says: When did I do this, Lord, I didn't see you? And then the Lord says: \nWhen you did this for the least of my brethren, you did it for me. Okay, I am just going to read it right from the Bible \nhere. So that was the [[Page H958]] first part. But the very first part of it is: ``But when the Son of Man comes in His \nglory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and \nHe will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the \n\n\n\nsheep on His right, the goats on His left. ``Then the King will say to those on His right''--the King being the Lord, the \nSon of Man--`` `Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the Kingdom prepared for you \nsince the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me \nsomething to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you \nlooked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' Then the righteous will answer Him, `Lord, when did we \nsee you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and \ninvite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' The \nKing will reply, `Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did \nfor me.'' This is the part that I really find challenging and we should all pay attention to. ``Then He will say to those \non His left, `Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I \nwas hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and \nyou did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look \nafter me.' They will also answer, `Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or \nsick or in prison and did not help you?' He will reply, `Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of \nthese, you did not do for me.' Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.'' So it is \nnot just what we do to take the opportunity to help and feed and clothe, it is what we do not do that the judgment \nwas made about. Opportunities missed. As I said earlier, to minister to the needs of God's creation--and we are all \nGod's creation--is an act of worship. To ignore those needs is to dishonor the God who made us. Very clear in the \nGospel of Matthew. As people of faith, as we all profess to be, and we believe--I mean, a faith is a gift, but we do \nbelieve that we are all God's children-- whatever we are, we are all, whatever it is. We are all God's children, we are \nall created in the image and likeness of God, we all carry a spark of divinity. When Christ came down from Heaven \nto participate in our humanity, He enabled us to participate in His divinity, that spark. So we respect it in people, but \nwe have to also recognize it in ourselves and the responsibility it carries with us. So I choose to go back to a place \nwhere we had a much better reception all over Washington, D.C., for loving the DREAMers and wanting to get the \njob done for them. Because in addressing their needs, we are talking about who we are as a nation. I have another \nstatement from Bonnie Watson Coleman. It was her birthday yesterday, so she will have about two or three \nstatements today. She talks about the Velez sisters from Burlington, New Jersey. The Velez sisters came to the \nUnited States at 4 and 9 years old, respectively, with their father fleeing the Chavez regime in Venezuela. Daniela \nhas earned two associates' degrees in engineering and business administration from Rowan College in New \nJersey. She is now pursuing an undergraduate degree in business administration at Rutgers Business School \nwhile she works full time for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. Daniela also cofounded a business \nthat sells take-home kits for physics labs in Rowan College. How many of us could do that? The kits allow students \nwho can't attend college lab courses to take an online version at home. Alex is awaiting word this spring on college \nacceptance at Camden County College, with her dreams to be a vet-tech. But without valid DACA status, Alex won't \nbe able to legally drive, attend the vet-tech program, or work. Alex said in an article with CNN: ``In all honesty, it is \nscary to think about leaving,'' she said. ``My mom cried for the first time since we talked about our situation. She's a \npositive person and is hoping that something good will happen for us.'' {time} 1715 Unfortunately, if the President \ndoesn't extend DACA protections, they said they will be forced to leave. Daniela recently told CNN: ``If DACA ends, \nI will leave with Alex. I will close my business, leave work and school.'' That is why we have to pass a bill, and that \nis why I would hope that the Speaker of the House would honor the House he is Speaker of by giving us a chance \nto vote on a DREAMer bill, a bipartisan DREAMer bill on the floor of the House. Carolyn Maloney is with us. I thank \nher for this testimony. It is about Diego de la Vega. Diego is a DREAMer who is an intern in Congresswoman \nMaloney's office and was the Congresswoman's guest at the State of the Union. Here is his story. ``Our family \nhistory traces generations of Ecuadorians since the early decades of the republic. Immigration was not common for \nus, and my parents and grandparents endured great periods of political instability and bleak futures. In 1999, at the \nage of 6, following an economic crash, hyperinflation, and a coup d'etat, my mother began making plans to move to \nthe United States. ``By August 2001, I arrived in New York City, and we settled in Queens. I was quickly enrolled in \npublic school. I learned English within a year, and I blended in with the rest of the children. But I was always aware \nof my status, and I quickly learned how long and how extremely difficult any real immigration reform in Congress \nwould be. By 2011, at 17 and after another fresh defeat of the DREAM Act, I faced the devastating feeling of being \ndenied the opportunity of accepting scholarships and student loans that effectively denied my shot at the colleges of \nmy choice. Yet I continued, attended Hunter College where all I wanted to do was study government and politics. \n``Shortly afterwards, President Obama's announcement of DACA was almost miraculous. I thought I could finally \n\n\n\nstep out of the shadows, no longer with fear but with excitement. I then entered the workforce immediately and \nfound myself employment in one of the leader wine retailers in the country, where I still work today. I also entered \nan internship with the district office of Congresswoman Maloney, which further cemented my belief that good \ngovernment is one that helps people. The high cost of living in New York and the strains of paying tuition out-of-\npocket still brought great challenges, but with DACA I felt that anything was possible. ``Now that DACA is on its last \nbreaths, I have no doubt that the courage and hope it has given us will carry us on until we all take our oath of \nallegiance.'' So beautiful. Thank you, Diego de la Vega. From Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, another proud \nBrooklyn Representative. She was here before, but I thank Congresswoman Clarke. Joel Perez Hernandez is a \nNew York public school graduate and proud New Yorker whose parents brought him to Brooklyn as a young child. \nIn September 2015, his Deferred Action was expiring. He set an appointment to renew his status and was \nbeginning to save his money to pay for the associated fees. Around this time, a small family emergency arose \namong his mother and her family in Mexico. With a fatal misunderstanding of the protections afforded by DACA, he \nand his family decided he was in the best position to travel to Mexico and still be allowed to return to the United \nStates. Unfortunately, he and his family did not have a strong understanding of how our immigration system \ncurrently works. As a result, 2 years after the Senate voted to protect DREAMers, Joel is now stuck in Mexico, a \ncountry that he does not know, with his girlfriend and life partner, Ambien, an American citizen. [[Page H959]] Joel \nhad no intention to break our immigration laws and would never have been in this position if this body had simply \ndone its job back in 2013. Joel's story illustrates the cost of our decisions and reminds us why we must take action \nnow to protect DREAMers. This is not an unusual thing where there are family emergencies or a death in the family \nacross the border or something and people don't fully understand that just going for that just destroys--under \ncurrent law, makes it very hard for them to come back. This is from Representative Cardenas, who was with us \nearlier. I thank him for being with us earlier. This is a letter to him from a graduate student: ``I am a current graduate \nstudent at the University of Southern California School of Social Work. As part of my curriculum, I am taking a class \non policy and advocacy where I am doing a project on a piece of legislation. My focus for this project is on \nimmigration, particularly on the newly introduced bill known as the BRIDGE Act, which will expand DACA for 3 \nyears. ``As an undocumented student, I am worried about my future here in the United States. I came to the \nUnited States at age 9, in 2001. I graduated with a B.A.''--bachelor of arts--``in sociology, with a minor in Women's \nStudies from Cal State Northridge in 2015. Thanks to DACA, I have been able to achieve my dreams of obtaining \nhigher education as well as to be able to work here legally.'' That is so important, to get an education, to work \nlegally to serve in the military. ``Having lived and attended public school all my life here, I don't know any other \ncountry I can call home. ``I had a very supportive system during my high school years. I graduated from San \nFernando High School with honors. I volunteered. I served in the community, student body, and to this day, I am \nworking for the betterment of my community working for the Los Angeles Family Housing. ``Now that Donald Trump \nis President, I am concerned about my future and that of my community. I want for others to have the same \nopportunities that I have had so far. ``I hope that you can allocate some of your time for me to talk to you about the \nimportance of this bill and why it matters, not only to me, but to the entire community. ``Alejandro Castro, Master's \nof Social Work Candidate.'' And this is from Grace Napolitano. Are you still with us? Thank you, Grace. I see we \nhave been joined by Albio Sires from New Jersey. We have had many DREAMers from New Jersey's testimony. \nAnd Donald Payne, I read your testimony earlier, Donald. Thank you for being with us. Congresswoman, I have \nbeen referring to you as the godmother of all of this all day. Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard. I acknowledged \nCongressman Garamendi who was here before and came back again, thank you. Mr. Green, I acknowledged him \nbefore when he was here, thank you. They are coming and going. Congresswoman Napolitano of California's \nconstituents have said this: Diego Garcia Ramirez, 31-year old man from El Monte, provider for his wife and three \nkids. He just had DACA approved at the end of July and considers the opportunity of DACA a blessing from God. \nHe has been able to provide a stable living for his family. He was brought to the U.S. at age 3. A real statement of it \ncan work. Cynthia Lopez Lopez, 26-year-old woman from El Monte also, waiting for her work authorization \ndocument to renew and fears she would lose her job at Wells Fargo. She is the caregiver for her mom, who is \nawaiting a lung transplant. She is the only source of income and pays for rent, medical bills, and essentials. Imagine \nthat, to have all of that challenged. But it is, again, it is the strength, the commitment to family that all of these \npeople have that strengthens America, and that is what argues for family unification in our immigration policy. That \nis a subject for another day. For today, we are talking about the DREAMers. Again, from Mike Thompson, whom I \nacknowledged earlier, he has another testimony, Mike Thompson of California. Denia Candela was born in \nAcapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. Today she lives in Sonoma Valley, California, and is his constituent. Denia is a 2011 \n\n\n\nalumni of 10,000 Degrees, an organization that serves low-income and first-generation students. 10,000 Degrees, \nthat means degrees from college, not temperature. She graduated from Sonoma State University in 2016 with a \nB.A. in applied statistics and a concentration in the actuarial field. She is currently involved in several different \norganizations and serves as a board member of the Sonoma Valley Education Foundation in the Sonoma Valley \nUnified School District. She is also involved as a commissioner for Sonoma County Regional Parks. Her current \nposition as the enrollment and outreach manager for a nonprofit has allowed her to serve families who need early \neducation services through State-funded preschools. Denia is now in her second year as a board member for Los \nCien Sonoma County. Above everything else, she is a mother to a wonderful 7-year-old. She received DACA in \n2012. DACA opened doors for her, allowing her to provide for her son and give back to the community that has \nseen her grow. Denia is a DREAMer. Thank you for dreaming, and thank you for inspiring us to dream as well. Ted \nLieu, testimony from Ted Lieu's district, who was with us until a few minutes ago. Josefina is an undocumented \nCalifornian who is originally from Colima, Mexico. Her testimony has been presented by Representative Ted Lieu \nfrom California. Josefina migrated to the United States when she was 3 years old. Well, her family immigrated to the \nUnited States when she was 3 years old, and she was with them. Although she became aware of her immigration at \nan early age, her status had never defined her. She had transformed uncertainty into determination. When she \ngraduated high school, she became hyperaware of the financial constraints faced by immigrant youth. Josefina \nwas able to afford her undergraduate education at UCLA by working multiple jobs and by applying to many \nscholarships. She would commute 2 hours every day, each way, to UCLA on a daily basis because she could not \nafford to dorm. Her main motivation is her mother, who is also an immigrant. Her persistent determination to \nprovide for her family convinces Josefina of her ability to surmount the barriers she faces as an undocumented \nstudent. Today, she is earning her Ph.D. at UCLA. Her Ph.D. at UCLA. Her research interests include the health \nand aging of the undocumented population. Her scholarly work has been supported by the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation and the Institute for Humane Studies. She believes research is a way to rewrite the narratives of the \nundocumented community in the United States: Undocumented people are the backbone of U.S. society, she \nwrites, yet we are dehumanized, tokenized, and invisibalized. That is a good word. This prompts the need for a \nsolution to immigration, which is long overdue. You are so right, Josefina. Mark DeSaulnier, whom I acknowledged \nearlier, is here with us. Mark is there. I thank Mark. This is from Marco of Contra Costa County, represented by \nCongressman Mark DeSaulnier. He is with us and has been with us for a long time today. It is from Marco, who \nsays: ``Thanks to DACA, I have been able to give back to the community in more profound ways. Because I was \ngranted employment authorization, I was able to work for 2 years as a case manager in reentry services. I helped \nmembers of my community find their way back into society after being in prison. I assisted them in managing their \nsobriety and finding stable employment and housing.'' God bless you, Marco. ``Currently, I am working in a \nnonprofit that provides free psychosocial services to cancer patients. My only dream in life is to be able to give back \nto my community, to help make them safer. I am also working on my master's in counseling and am on a licensure \ntrack as a marriage and family therapist. [[Page H960]] ``I plan to use my license to continue working with the \nchemically dependent and criminal populations. I want to help make our communities safer. DACA allows me to \ncontinue working on my dream.'' That is beautiful, Marco. Remember what the Lord said in the Gospel of Matthew: \nWhen I was in prison, you visited me. Thank you for doing that. {time} 1730 Elias Rosenfeld, Boston, \nMassachusetts. I met Elias at the Faith Leaders Event. I had the privilege to meet Elias this month, when he came \nto the Capitol with DREAMers and faith leaders so he could share his story. Born in Venezuela, Elias came to the \nUnited States as a young child. Shortly after his mother passed away, United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices filed a letter notifying him that he was now an undocumented individual, unable to receive healthcare, \nwork and provide for his family, or obtain a driver's license to commute to and from school. Elias, however, fought \nto find a solution. He founded United Student Immigrants, USI, a student-led community-based organization that \nhelped over 300 undocumented students be able to afford a college education. Elias has also partnered with the \nFlorida High School Young Democrats and The Children's Trust, and lobbied over 200 State legislators in support \nof State-sponsored immigrant child healthcare, which resulted in the passing of the Senate and House bills \nprotecting healthcare for over 22,000 children in Florida. Elias has spearheaded student demonstrations at over 20 \nState and Federal congressional offices in support of the Dream Act. He received a 6-year full-merit scholarship to \nBrandeis University under the TYP social justice scholarship program. Recently, Elias worked in campaigns in \nFlorida and New Hampshire as a campaign fellow and intern for the immigration department for Senator Elizabeth \nWarren. He also shared with us his religious beliefs that day. He made a very, very impressive presentation. Thank \nyou, Elias. I had the privilege to meet Andrea Ortiz this month, when she came to the Capitol to share her story with \n\n\n\nMembers, faith leaders, and the American people. Andrea Carolina Ortiz Duran is a God-driven, passionate, \ncreative leader. Born in Leon, Mexico, Andrea migrated to the United States at the age of 6 with her parents and \nfour siblings. She was able to successfully apply for the DACA program. Having successfully navigated the \neducation system as a first- generation undocumented student, she became a role model for her siblings and \ncommunity members. She graduated with honors in business administration from the California State Polytechnic \nUniversity, Pomona, with a focus in management, human resources, and entrepreneurship. Andrea seeks to use \nher experience, education, and skills to support in uplifting Latino/ Hispanic communities and underrepresented \nstudents. Faith and family, together, is what drives Andrea to keep pushing forward in life. Again, from some other \nMembers, from Alma Adams, who was with us earlier, from North Carolina. She tells the story of Brenda Montanez. \nBrenda Montanez was born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and came to Charlotte, North Carolina, as a child with her \nparents. Brenda always knew she wanted to attend college, and because of DACA, she was able to. At 18, Brenda \nenrolled at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, where she is a student leader. She is a founding member of \nthe Latinos Aiming for Achievement, LAFA, a group founded to give Latino students on campus a voice in the \ncommunity and a place to meet and discuss issues impacting them. To date, there are 32 members of the \norganization. Brenda is one of many students nationwide who has been able to achieve her goals of earning a \nsecondary degree thanks to DACA. Thank you, Alma Adams, for submitting Brenda's story. This is from \nRepresentative Jared Huffman from California: Alex DeLeon is a talented young woman who interned in \nRepresentative Huffman's office. He recently invited her to speak at a townhall on the future of DACA, and here is \nwhat she said: ``I'm smart. I'm resilient. I'm hardworking. I'm a DREAMer. I'm going to make something out of \nmyself one day, but only if programs like DACA live on. And I'm not the only one: your classmate is a DREAMer, \nyour lawyer is a DREAMer, and your boss is a DREAMer. We're worth protecting and we're here to stay. That's why \nI'm getting out there and urging Congress to save the DACA program to allow nearly 800,000 young Americans, \nlike me, to keep working towards their aspirations and contributing to the only country that they call home.'' I have \nhad the occasion to have a conversation with Alex DeLeon. She is a remarkable young woman in doing so much in \nthe community to give back. I am so glad that Jared Huffman has called her testimony to our attention. Peter Welch \nfrom Vermont and Rick Larsen from the State of Washington are here. Congressman Welch calls to our attention \nthe story about a DREAMer that he knows, and it is a letter from Juan Conde. I will preface this by saying Juan \nConde, bachelor's of science, master's of science, Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology, current medical \nstudent at the University of Vermont, all of that. I am telling you, this rug is killing me. Standing up is nothing, being \nhungry is nothing, being thirsty is nothing. It is the rug that is getting to me. Juan Conde writes: ``Dear \nCongressman Welch, I am writing to tell you my story about DACA in the hope that you and your colleagues will \ncome up with a legislative solution to this issue. I am one of the `DREAMer kids.' I have lived most of my life in the \nU.S. and consider it my home. ``Throughout my life, I have been driven to understand cancer and have dedicated \nmy studies to obtain the training needed to help cancer patients. My mother passed away from cancer, and this \ntragedy made me realize that I wanted to dedicate my life to fighting this disease. This is why I spent a decade of \nmy life in research, first in apoptosis during my M.S., and then DNA repair of tobacco and smoke carcinogenesis for \nmy doctorate studies. ``I chose science because, at the time, it was impossible for undocumented students to \nattend medical school, and I wanted to have an impact on a disease that had affected my family. It was difficult to \nobtain my degree as an undocumented student, but I persisted because I believed in the promise of the American \nDream. ``When DACA was announced, it transformed my life. Suddenly I could be paid for the research I was \ndoing. I could drive, I could be free from the fear of deportation, knowing that all my hard work and dedication would \nnot be meaningless, and that the idea of America and her promise were alive and strong. It also meant that medical \nschools, including my current school, UVM's Larner College of Medicine, changed their policies and gave DACA \nstudents a chance to enroll. ``I understand that legislation takes time, but if there is anything you can do to help \nDACA students, including a discharge petition, please do so. If you do, you will have the gratitude of a group of \ndedicated individuals who wish nothing more than to give back to the only country they have ever known.'' Okay. So \nnow this one says: Today, the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus wrote to Speaker Paul Ryan to request a \n``Queen of the Hill'' rule to govern debate on competing DACA and border security proposals to establish the official \nposition of the U.S. House of Representatives. Last week, the 48-member Problem Solvers Caucus announced a \nbipartisan set of principles that lay the groundwork for a deal on DACA and border security. The letter was led in the \nProblem Solvers Caucus by Fred Upton, Republican from Michigan; and Peter Welch. The text of the letter can be \nfound below and here: ``Dear Mr. Speaker, the President challenged us last fall to legislate the DACA program \nrather than relying on executive orders to determine its fate. The President has also asked us to address border \n\n\n\nsecurity. [[Page H961]] ``DACA is an important issue in all of our States. And, as we know, the program's original \nintent was to protect from deportation eligible children and young adults who were brought to this country through \nno fault of their own. We have learned through multiple reports that the U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement has moved to deport many who have been here for years, including some who are now married with \nchildren. Many have paid their taxes and have no serious criminal record. Many know no other way of life. ``There \nare a number of worthy Member proposals that should be properly debated and voted on by the House. Some are \nbipartisan and would end the uncertainty and distress that some 800,000 DACA recipients are enduring. Others \nwould also address the issue of border security and broader immigration reform issues. ``Mr. Speaker, we seek \nyour commitment that the House will address the uncertainty of the DACA-eligible population in a timely fashion, \neither separately or as part of a broader package, using an open and inclusive process that allows the House to \nwork its will. ``Specifically, we seek your commitment that the House will debate and vote on all serious and \nsubstantive proposals, particularly those offered on a bipartisan basis, as well as any bill approved by the full \nSenate. A `Queen of the Hill' rule should be employed that establishes the proposal receiving the most votes as the \nposition of the House. ``We accept the responsibility to reach consensus on a legislative solution to DACA and are \ndetermined to resolve this issue. We believe immigration reform should be bipartisan and that only an open process \nallowing for the best ideas from both sides will demonstrate to the American people that we can find common \nground.'' That was a letter from the Problem Solvers Caucus, led by Representative Fred Upton, Republican from \nMichigan; and Peter Welch, Democrat from Vermont. This is very important because we are talking about Queen of \nthe Hill. As you know, my colleagues, there are several options to come to the floor. One is Queen of the Hill; one is \nKing of the Hill. Queen of the Hill means the bill that gets the most votes is the bill that prevails. It would go to \nconference with the Senate; or if it is the Senate bill, would go to the President's desk. King of the Hill, which we are \nnot advocating, is the one that wins last. We want the one that gets the most votes, the one that wins the most \nvotes. This time, the queen should prevail. I appreciate the letter from Fred Upton and Peter Welch because it talks \nabout some very important things: a bipartisan, open process. That brings people together: bipartisanship, \ntransparency, unity. I thank the caucus for this. Okay. We have another story from Houston, from Sheila Jackson \nLee. Andrea Ramos Fernandez is a local San Antonio DREAMer, who adores San Antonio, as any true San \nAntonian would. In 2005, Andrea was 8 years old when she moved to the United States. She was too young to \nrealize the spring break vacation her mother had planned was a permanent move--that that vacation was a \npermanent move. This move was influenced by economic instability, paired with her father's stabbing in a taxi cab \nin Mexico City. Once Andrea and her mother made it to the U.S., Andrea's grandparents, who are U.S. citizens, \nbegan the process to legalize Andrea's mother. What Andrea's grandparents didn't realize was that the broken \nimmigration system made it difficult to grant Andrea's mother a green card, that immigration process being over 23 \nyears, leaving Andrea out of the possibility to adjust her status. ``Chain migration''--we call it family unification--has \nbeen a broken issue within the government, and in this case, Andrea's grandparents could do nothing to change \nher status. That is why we want to improve it. So Andrea grew up undocumented. She grew up pledging \nallegiance to the American flag, watching American cartoons on Saturday mornings, and getting good grades. \nAndrea's academic performance was so great that her first academic award was the President's Award, which was \nsigned by then-President Obama. Andrea continued her education with academic excellence, achieving high marks, \neventually graduating Churchill High School with honors. Her grades then led her to get a full ride at Texas State \nUniversity in San Marcos, Texas, where she pursued a career in healthcare for 2 years. Eventually, Andrea decided \nto transfer to the University of Texas in San Antonio, where she is now currently studying public policy while being a \nstudent leader on her campus. Andrea has been involved in various projects around the city of San Antonio, \nworking as the lead immigration fellow for MOVE San Antonio. She has also pushed for educational initiatives on \nher campus, leading to the creation of the first onsite DREAMer Center on a college campus in Texas. Because of \nher leadership, Andrea has been given the opportunity to visit D.C. to lobby for the Dream Act and is now asking \nthe Congress and Senate to act on bipartisan legislation. Andrea graduates in December of 2018, 4 months after \nher DACA expires. While Andrea is worried about what that may mean to her, she worries more about her \ncommunity, whom she sees as a community full of promise. Andrea is an American who adores and believes in the \nAmerican promise. Andrea cheered when the Spurs won their fourth championship in 2007, and once more in 2014. \nOkay. That was then. This is now. Okay. She also mourned with our country in some of our worst tragedies, as this \ncountry's pain was also her own. Therefore, she asks to be given the opportunity to prove she is already an \nAmerican. How lovely. How lovely, Andrea. A little bit of my Golden State Warriors coming in there when she was \ntalking about the Spurs, but anyway. From Congresswoman Roybal-Allard, who is with us, the godmother of it all, \n\n\n\nwe have this testimony from one of her student DREAMers: ``I am a student of East Los Angeles College and part \nof your congressional district. I am very concerned about the initiative President Donald Trump took towards the \nDACA program. He gave Congress 6 months to find a solution. As of today, there has been no progress and many \nare losing the protection they had with DACA. I am asking to fight for a clean Dream Act for all. The immigrant \ncommunity is a hardworking group of individuals that are in this country for a better life, meaning that they want to \nwork, educate themselves, be in the Army, and have all the benefits this country provides to make it an even better \nplace to live in. ``Sincerely, Luvia Navarrete, DACA recipient.'' To Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, this letter \nbegins: ``Hi, Mrs. Lucille. I am Ana Garay from District 40. I am a DACA student from East Los Angeles College and \nI wanted to tell you my concerns about the DACA problem that is going on right now. I wanted to tell you I am really \nscared of what could happen in the next months, because, as other students, I want to accomplish my dreams and \nbe a proud Latina, as you are. I hope that we fight together for what we want for our future as a community, \nbecause we are known as the one that fights together.'' Signed, Ms. Ana Garay. In the previous letter that I was \nreading from, the one from San Antonio, she talks about how many years it would take for the grandparents to help \nthe daughter to become legal and to get a green card. The other day, there was an article in the paper, a big, long \narticle, about how backed up the green card applications are; years, years. So even the people who want to be \ndoing things on schedule, many people are here not because they came illegally, but because the process took so \nlong that their opportunity expired. {time} 1745 This is from Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who has joined us. \nThank you, Congresswoman DeLauro. ``Dear Representative DeLauro: I was honored to intern in your Washington \noffice and learn more about the government of the United States and, more specifically, responding to constituents' \nconcerns. ``Walking through the long tunnels that connect the congressional buildings to the Capitol, I began to \nenvision [[Page H962]] myself working in the District of Columbia upon graduation. But like for many people, the \nelection results have forced me to take a different path. ``After the Presidential election, all the stability that had \nallowed my family and me to become part of the American life was turned into fear and doubt about our future. \n``Not only has the President-elect vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, but he also promised to \nremove the DACA program. For this reason, I had to return to New Haven and assist my family as we figure out \nwhich decisions are best to take moving forward. Thus, I am sorry to inform you I will no longer be able to continue \nmy internship in your Washington, D.C., office. ``I want to express that, while I am in constant fear questioning \nwhether I'll be able to complete my undergraduate degree, or if my U.S.-citizen sister will be separated from us, I \nam not giving in. ``My best memory working in your office was running into an old employer who came to the office \nfor a Capitol tour. Reflecting on the aspirations I had working as a busser to get myself through high school, I \nremember your persona always providing me with hope. ``That hope has grown exponentially as I reminisce on the \ntimes you walked into the office and greeted all your interns with such gratitude and enthusiasm. ``With infinite \ngratitude.'' Thank you, Congresswoman DeLauro, for submitting this testimony to us and recognizing the difficult \ndecisions that families have to make in the interest of families staying together. Thank you. Niki Tsongas of \nMassachusetts has joined us. Thank you. Congresswoman Gwen Moore of Wisconsin has joined us as well. \nCongresswoman Frederica Wilson of Florida has joined us as well. Thank you, Congresswoman Wilson, for joining \nus. Again, this is from Representative Watson Coleman: Another constituent, Diana Diaz, who is 22 years old. She \ncame to the United States from Mexico with her mother and two older siblings in 2002 when Diana was 7 years old. \nThey settled in Somerset, New Jersey, where her mother worked long hours to ensure that her children could focus \nall their attention on school. Diana graduated from high school in New Brunswick, New Jersey. While still in high \nschool, Diana herself worked a full-time job to help support her family. After high school, she attended Middlesex \nCounty Community College, where she got her associate's degree in education. She then continued her higher \neducation and transferred to Rutgers- Newark in the fall of 2016. There she majors in public administration and \nminors in Spanish. Diana has aspirations to continue her education and enroll in a master's program to become a \ncertified legal interpreter. Wow. That is hard. She hopes to head back to New Brunswick and work in the public \nschool system as an administrator to help students just like her. She also wants to create a nonprofit organization \nto assist various ethnic groups with gaining access to higher education. Diana truly believes that the education she \nreceived in New Jersey was so valuable to her overall success, and she wants to give back so that others can \nfollow suit. I just want to dwell on this for a moment because she is talking about education being invaluable to her \nsuccess, and she wants to give back so that others can follow suit. I hope that the Italian-American, Irish-American, \nGerman-American, Dutch-American, all of the ethnic groups that are here in our country take full pride in the \nexample they have set for how the American Dream works in America, because what you see with these \nDREAMers just follows so closely with what our families did, our ancestors did coming here. The idea that \n\n\n\neducation was key to upward mobility and to reaching personal aspirations, that faith and family and a work ethic \nwere an important part of how you were regarded in America--and this may be what is in their DNA as they come to \nthe United States, but it is clear they had masterful, great examples to show how to achieve the American Dream in \nall of the waves of immigration that came before. Family, faith, community, education, patriotism, love of America. \nSo beautiful. And Diana spells it out so clearly here. Another one from Representative Jayapal of Washington State. \nWe heard from her earlier. She was with us earlier, Representative Jayapal. She is on the Judiciary Committee, a \nleader on immigration. She is an immigrant herself. Twenty-two-year-old Esther was a hardworking and valued \nintern in Representative Jayapal's office last year. She is also a DREAMer who came to the United States with her \nparents and younger sister when she was just 3 years old from South Korea. When they arrived on a visa, Esther's \nparents sought help from an immigration lawyer to obtain more permanent legal status in the United States. They \nfilled out applications, paid their dues, and gave the lawyer most of the money they had. And he ran away with all of \nit. He scammed them and left them with nothing. Esther's parents' visas expired. They had little money. They \npushed their kids around in shopping carts because a stroller was too expensive. Then they started over. They built \ntheir lives in the United States. They raised a smart, passionate daughter who is now a senior at Harvard. The \nDACA status Esther obtained in 2013 helped to give her the freedom to pursue her own American Dream. Even \nwhen Esther's DACA status was secure, she said that typical safe spaces like hospitals, police stations, and \ndoctor's offices filled her with fear because DACA doesn't afford protections to her family. She also hides her status \nand worries what would happen if someone she trusted outed them to immigration authorities. Unless we take \nimmediate action to help DREAMers, Esther's future is even more uncertain. Thank you, Esther, for sharing your \nstory with us. Thank you, Congresswoman Jayapal, for sharing it. We have been joined by Cedric Richmond, the \ndistinguished chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Earlier I read statistics from the caucus about how many \npeople were DREAMers from the Caribbean, from Nigeria, et cetera. We read some testimony that was from our \npress conference by the DREAMer sent by Kamala Harris from Belize and coming from the African-American \ncommunity now. Thank you for coming, Congressman Richmond. Now we have one from David Vasquez, a \nDREAMer I have met. David was born in Germany and moved to the United States at age 13. He grew up in Elk \nGrove Village, Illinois, and graduated at the top of his high school class. He earned a full-ride scholarship to \nBowdoin College through QuestBridge, an organization that links low-income students with top colleges in the U.S. \nDavid graduated from Bowdoin with a double major in economics and German and was able to spend two summers \ninterning at Goldman Sachs. He later joined AlphaSights, a high-growth startup. At AlphaSights, David established \nthe firm's San Francisco office and grew it from 8 to 25 employees. That is an important point because many of \nthese DREAMers have started businesses, created jobs; by creating small businesses and being entrepreneurs, \nsmall and larger jobs. That is really an important part of our economy. Jesper Kim from Fotorama: Jesper is a South \nKorean-born immigrant brought to the United States when he was 2 years old. He received his associate's degree \nand is pursuing a degree in computer science while working at his high school's photography studio. He continues \nto volunteer at his church and in his high school's Key Club. Evelyn Valdez-Ward from Irvine, California: Graduate \nstudent, University of California, Irvine. A first-generation, female, Hispanic, undocumented scientist, Evelyn \nconstantly seeks to dismantle economic, racial, and cultural barriers. She is part of the 1 percent of 800,000 DACA \nstudents pursuing postgraduate education. In addition to studying climate change's impact on planet productivity \nand drought tolerance, she is a strong and loud advocate for her undocumented community. I would say ``vocal.'' \n[[Page H963]] Evelyn received her B.S. in biology from the University of Houston- Downtown in 2016. As an \nundergraduate, she spent 3 years on a variety of research projects that sparked her passion for ecology. In 2013, \nshe helped to create a planet-water transport model using chaparral shrubs to test drought tolerance in \ncollaboration with Drs. Michael Tobin, Brandon Pratt, and Anna Jacobson of California State University, Bakersfield. \nThis is very important research. In 2014 and 2015, she worked under the direction of Drs. Scott Mangan, Michael \nTobin, and Claudia Stein at Washington University in St. Louis, Tyson Research Center, where she studied \nphylogenetic relationships and the effects of drought in prairie grasslands. As a second-year Ph.D. student in the \nDepartment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine and Ford Foundation \nPredoctoral Fellowship, she is currently studying the effects of climate change on the interaction between plants \nand their soil microbes. She is dedicated to combining her scientific training with mentoring of underrepresented \nminorities in STEM, especially within the community of undocumented students. Evelyn aims to inspire the next \ngeneration of scientists by pushing forward the mission to diversify STEM. Thank you for that, Evelyn. Again, many \nof the great discoveries in America came from immigrants coming here. Many of the great academic minds in our \ncountry came from another country. But then, at the same time, America produced our own, and that is a pretty \n\n\n\nexciting combination. Ana Cueva: Ana Cueva was a young Mexican immigrant who has called Utah and the United \nStates home since 1998 when she was 5 years old. We have a number of DREAMers from Utah, so we thank them \nfor speaking up. From this young age, she was always taught the importance of education, hard work, and family. \nBeyond the values her parents instilled in her, her future was also shaped when a year after arriving to this country \nher mom became very ill. This experience gave her a desire to help others, and she began to forge a path on her \njourney to find her calling in nursing. In fact, nursing was solidified as her American Dream when she was just 9 \nyears old. To achieve this dream, she understood how important it was to honor her parents' decisions and \ndedicated herself to education and community. As a teenager, she quickly became a volunteer at her local hospital \nand later was elected president of the National Honor Society for her high school chapter. She attended an \naccelerated high school, earned her associate's degree in science at 17, and graduated in the top 10 percent of \nher senior class. She continued her studies a year later with the help of DACA. Now she prides herself in being able \nto say she achieved her professional dream of being a registered nurse, BSN, currently working in the shock \ntherapy ICU at a Level I trauma center in Utah. She graduated with high honors from Utah Valley University in \nDecember 2016. Thank you, Ana Cueva, for sharing your story with us. Keyla Garcia Espino of Wyoming: Kayla \nGarcia Espino came to the United States when she was 5 years old from Mexico. In 2016 she earned her \nbachelor's degree in business administration with a concentration in accounting from Ferris State University. Keyla \nis the deputy treasurer for the city of East Grand Rapids and has been working for the city for almost 3 years. Her \nDACA expires in October of 2018. May I correct the Record. She is not from Wyoming--she is from Wyoming, \nMichigan. Is that a city in Michigan? Wyoming? This is from Colleen Hanabusa, who has been with us for a large \npart of the day, this testimony. Am I not lucky to be able to become so familiar with so many of these beautiful \nDREAMers? We want to send these people back? This talent, this rich talent? This achievement, this \ndetermination, this faith in the future, this patriotism for America? I don't think so. {time} 1800 We have to make it \nhappen. I have confidence. Hi, my name is Sisilia Kaufusi. I am a DACA recipient. My parents came to the United \nStates of America seeking the American Dream. I and my siblings came here when we were young. I was 4 when \nmy mother and I came to the USofA. It was not until I was a senior in high school that I found out I had no legal \nstatus in this country of opportunities. Today, I humbly ask that you issue legal resident status to those who have \nbenefited from President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). President John F. Kennedy said: \n``Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.'' Over 700,000 people have \nbenefited from this program. This program had opened the doors for not only myself, but other undocumented \nchildren. Thanks to DACA, they have obtained education, employment, and other leadership roles with their \ncommunity. Within their community so that they can do something for our country. President-elect Trump said he \nwill end this program or allow this program to expire. By doing so, he is slamming the door on the face of DACA \nrecipients, which will undoubtedly damage communities and the economy across the country, and perhaps even \nacross the world. DACA recipients feel a sense of danger, which is why I write this letter today. People that have \nbenefited from DACA have no other objective in mind than to become positive members of the U.S. community. \nThose with severe criminal backgrounds did not and do not qualify for DACA. And this is a letter from Sisilia to \nCongresswoman Colleen Hanabusa: With this in mind, I respectfully ask that you forgive DACA recipients and urge \nyou to pass legislation which allows DACA recipients to become U.S. residents and protect the information they \nhave turned to the Department of Homeland Security, in order to return peace of mind to these families \nimmediately. It is only with your help that we continue working for a better America. It is interesting, as we read \nthese letters--I am sure my colleagues would agree--to see how many families hesitated to tell their children about \ntheir status. I can understand why they would not want to frighten them, but nonetheless, when they do find out, \nthey are very shocked by it. We shouldn't have that kind of fear and shock in our country, especially for our \nchildren. So while these parents took great risk, had great courage and determination to protect their children, \nunfortunately, we didn't have comprehensive immigration reform soon enough to have avoided some of those sad \nsituations. Congresswoman Velazquez has another testimonial from a DREAMer. Yatziri Tovar is a young New \nYorker and, yes, an American, who faces an uncertain future. Yatziri Tovar came to the United States from Mexico \nat age 2. She is American in every way--except on paper. Last year, after a lot of hard work, Yatziri graduated from \nCity College in New York. She achieved this goal while holding down a job at the same time she completed her \nstudies. Because she is undocumented, Yatziri was not able to secure financial aid. Now Yatziri is giving back by \nworking with a community group that stands up for and empowers some of her most vulnerable neighbors, like \nother immigrants and low-income workers. Yatziri is exactly the type of person we want contributing to our Nation. \nYet, Congress is now contemplating turning its back on young DREAMers like Yatziri. This is shameful. For young, \n\n\n\npatriotic people like Yatziri and for hundreds of thousands of young Americans--yes, Americans--we need to pass a \nDream Act now. I appreciate this statement from Yatziri Tovar, but I hope that we can be more optimistic about the \nprospect of not turning our back, but on embracing our DREAMers by having a discussion, a debate on the floor of \nthe House and passing legislation. I hope the Speaker will give us in this House of Representatives the dignity that \nwe deserve to be able to discuss matters of concern to our constituents on the floor of this House and have the \nHouse of Representatives work its will in order to address this issue. [[Page H964]] The Senate has gotten that \nprivilege--not privilege--it is really a given, by the leader in the Senate, Mr. McConnell, in consultation with a \nbipartisan group of Members, we have bipartisan legislation, as has been said over and over. What we do should \nbe bipartisan, should be done openly, and should unify people. That should be a rule of thumb for everything we do. \nIt is especially necessary to do this soon. Why? We ask the question: Why is the House cut out of this discussion? \nWhy? We need that answer from the Speaker of the House. Why are we not given our constitutional opportunity to \ndiscuss this important issue? Just a few more from Members. Actually, I could stay here for the full 40 hours and do \nthis, but I know that we have a vote to take, and the rest. So let us just conclude with Carlos Aguilar, same last \nname as our cosponsors of the Hurd- Aguilar bill--no relation. Carlos migrated to the United States from Irapuato, \nMexico, at the age of 14 and currently lives in Kerrville, Texas. After graduating from high school, he received his \nB.A. in psychology from Schreiner University. Carlos has also earned an M.S. in sociology at the University of \nTexas at San Antonio. Currently, he is attending the Harvard Graduate School of Education where he is pursuing a \ndoctoral degree. Aware of the obstacles along undocumented students' road, Carlos has devoted his academic \nand professional endeavors to issues relating to unauthorized migration as well as providing support and guidance \nfor this vulnerable population. In addition to academic attention to these issues, Carlos has remained active in the \nimmigrant community as the Immigrant Youth Leadership coordinator at UTSA--that is University of Texas at San \nAntonio--as an associate legal assistant in an immigrant law firm. He has many accomplishments. Moreover, \ntogether with other undocumented and DACA students, Carlos coordinated students' efforts at UTSA--University \nof Texas at San Antonio--in mobilizing to defend their rights as undocumented and DACA students. Through the \ncreation of Immigrant Youth Leadership, they advocated and worked to improve the educational experience of this \npopulation. I am just going to one more from California. I have to end on California. Kimberly came to the United \nStates from Mexico and currently resides in Los Angeles. She is the only person in her family without papers and, in \nspite of the challenge, has risen to the occasion as an advocate for DREAMers. She implemented a resolution \nsupporting DREAMers at her local community college. She is involved in the advocacy community in Victorville and \nspent time as an intern in Congressman Cook's office--bipartisan. She hopes to become a lawyer one day. We \nhave been joined by Congresswoman Schakowsky. I thank the gentlewoman for being with us; Congresswoman \nKathy Castor. I acknowledged the gentlewoman earlier. She was here before. And in back is Congresswoman \nCarol Shea-Porter; Congresswoman Robin Kelly; Congressman Steve Cohen is with us; Congressman John \nDelaney. I am trying to recognize just the ones I hadn't acknowledged before: Congresswoman Katherine Clark, \nCongresswoman Julia Brownley, Congresswoman Jackie Speier. I acknowledged Congresswoman Suzan \nDelBene, Congressman Bobby Scott, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Congressman Brad Sherman--\nI read your testimony earlier as I did yours, Alma--Congressman David Cicilline, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke--I \nread your testimony earlier as well. All the others I think I have acknowledged. Yes, Hank Johnson from Georgia, \nCongressman Hank Johnson. I think we have acknowledged all of the Members who are here. Congresswoman \nGwen Moore, I acknowledged earlier when she was sitting over here. I will tell the gentlewoman who she was sitting \nnext to. She was sitting next to Congresswoman Niki Tsongas at that time, but anyway, I acknowledge the \ngentlewoman again and thank her. Mr. Speaker, for the last 8 hours, I have had the privilege of reading the \ntestimony of so many DREAMers. I still have more, but I thank all of you. It is a privilege to read the eloquent \nstatements of the DREAMers as they express their love of America, their commitment to a better future for our \ncountry and their own families' better future. It was a double honor to do so with the recommendations of the \ntestimony that you all extended, presented, and to have so many of you here in the course of the day, a real tribute \nto the respect that we have for our DREAMers. So I accept your applause on behalf of them because it was their \nstory, in their words--by and large--that I told, in addition to the Bible and the Catholic Conference of Bishops and \nPope Francis and Pope Benedict and so many other religious groups that we have. But I thank all of you. Our basic \nrequest is: honor the House of Representatives. Give us a chance to have a vote on the floor. The Republican \nleader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, has gone forward with the budget proposal with the promise that he will give \nthat opportunity to the floor of the Senate. The Senate will work its will. We will see what they produce. We will work \nour will here and see what we produce, but it must be bipartisan, transparent, and unifying. We think that there has \n\n\n\nbeen a lot of groundwork. In our case, the Hurd-Aguilar bill is one option. The Senate bill may be another option. \nThere may be other options that are proposed. I am just telling you about the bipartisan ones. Mr. Speaker, I thank \nthe staff of the House of Representatives and the various speakers at the House who have been up there with such \ncourtesy--you smiled. You smiled. But most of all, let us thank and acknowledge the DREAMers for their courage, \ntheir optimism, and their inspiration to make America more American. I thank my colleagues. Ms. MAXINE \nWATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Allow me to just say that we \ncontinue on this most important legislation, H.R. 1153, and we have had the opportunity to yield time to Leader \nPelosi, and while she certainly came in to oppose this bill that we have before us, having yielded 1 minute to the \nleader is the most profound 1 minute probably in the history of this institution, that 1 minute that ended up 8 hours \nwhere Leader Pelosi talked about the plight of DACA and the DREAMers. And I am very proud that in yielding that \n1 minute we had the opportunity to listen to Leader Pelosi deal with an issue and demand that we have an \nopportunity to have a real debate and a real discussion in the people's House. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that \nwe had that opportunity, and now let me just say, I have no further requests for time, and I am prepared to close. \nMr. Speaker, American consumers are under attack by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress \nevery day. We learn about either another effort to weaken guardrails, protecting consumers from predatory actors, \nor another Trump appointee refusing to hold bad actors accountable. Trump supporters at the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission have basically stopped enforcing our Nation's \nconsumer and security laws. {time} 1815 Mr. Speaker, as you know, there is a lot of excitement here because of \nwhat took place in the last 8 hours, so I don't feel interrupted at all. I just feel very, very pleased that we had the \nopportunity to have that speech by our leader. However, I will just continue. Let me just get to the fact that, again, \nMick Mulvaney, whom Trump unlawfully appointed as Acting Director of the Consumer Bureau, is gutting the \nConsumer Bureau's Office of Fair Lending Equal Opportunity limiting the Consumer Bureau's ability to stop bad \nactors from discriminating against communities of color. News reports also suggest that Mulvaney has slowed down \nthe Consumer Bureau's investigation of Wells Fargo, the ultimate example of a recidivist megabank. Wells Fargo \nhas publicly admitted to ripping off millions of Americans with fraudulent checking accounts, credit cards, forced-\nplaced auto insurance, and much, much more. [[Page H965]] But the Trump administration has a partner in its \nefforts to undermine consumer protections. House Republicans have been in lockstep with the President when it \ncomes to rolling back consumer protections. Take the Consumer Bureau's rule on forced arbitration: Wall Street \nlobbied hard against this rule, and instead of putting consumers first, House Republicans passed a Congressional \nReview Act resolution to repeal a rule that would have helped consumers who have been wronged by the big banks \nto join together to hold them accountable. But that is just one example of how House Republicans have tried to \nundermine consumer laws. For years now, they have tried to cut the funding of the Consumer Bureau or to change \nits structure, and having failed in those attempts, they now have their inside man, Mick Mulvaney, who is working to \ndestroy the Bureau from within. We shouldn't be surprised since the chairman of the Financial Services Committee \nhas said he wants to ``financially terminate'' the Consumer Bureau. The bill before us today should be viewed as \none part of this long line of attempts by my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle to undermine the \nfundamental consumer protection. Home buyers should not be gouged or swindled just because they want to own a \nhome. H.R. 1153 would legitimize predatory kickbacks through affiliated firms. Megabanks, including bad actors \nlike Wells Fargo, and other lenders would be incentivized to steer their borrowers into more costly products simply \nbecause they can. H.R. 1153 is a bad bill that will only line the pockets of Wall Street with the hard-earned savings \nof Main Street. But don't just take my word for it. Civil rights groups and consumer advocates all agree that this is \nbad for America. So, despite all of the excitement that we have had here on the floor today with Leader Pelosi and \nthe message that she brought to this Congress, I want all of our Members to simply reject President Trump's and \nHouse Republicans' attack on consumers. Vote ``no'' on H.R. 1153 and support Leader Pelosi in calling for a \ndebate in this House on the issue dealing with DACA and the DREAMers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of \nmy time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bergman). The gentleman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. Mr. \nHENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we could not be more highly \nhonored that the minority leader would take such an interest in H.R. 1533, the Mortgage Choice Act. I am reminded \nthat there are Members who come to this great Chamber to make speeches, and there are those who come to \nmake laws. When it comes to speeches, I would note that the Gettysburg Address came in at 2 minutes, and \nAmericans may think it had greater eloquence. I would note that as the minority leader quoted the Bible frequently \nthroughout her speech, it reminds me of Isaiah 1:18, ``Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord.'' Yet \nPresident Trump stood right there in the State of the Union Address with his hand out with an olive branch \n\n\n\nextending an open hand to work with Members of both parties on an immigration reform package. He offered a fair \ncompromise. He offered a fair compromise, and, instead, the minority leader slapped his hand and called it \ninsulting, Mr. Speaker. She called it lame. She called it dangerous. This is not someone who has come to this \nChamber, the people's House, in order to make law. The President didn't offer legalization. He offered a pathway to \ncitizenship. He didn't offer this for 700,000. He offered it for 1.8 million. He said: Let's secure our borders, and let's \nmake sure that immigrants who come to this country come legally and come with their sleeves rolled up coming to \nwork and build America. There are those who want to solve a problem, and there are those who want to exacerbate \na problem for the election. Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans need the opportunity to get mortgages \nto buy their part of the American Dream. Everything that the ranking member said, she ought to share it with her \nown Democrats because half of them on our committee support H.R. 1533 which is good for America and good for \nprospective home buyers. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all House Members to adopt it, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 725, the \nprevious question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill \nwas ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The \nquestion is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the \nayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays \nwere ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question \nwill be postponed. \n"}
