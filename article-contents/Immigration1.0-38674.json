{"title": "POLL: 63% oppose Baird // Clinton lobbies senators", "body": "\nZoe Baird, whose nomination as the nation's first female attorney general seem assured by the Senate a week \nago, wouldn't be confirmed by the public today.\n\nA USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll Thursday shows 63% of 600 people interviewed don't think she should be \nconfirmed because of her admission that she knowingly hired two undocumented immigrants.\n\n''Of course (the nomination) is in trouble,'' Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D- Ill., one of the first two women on the \nJudiciary Committee, said Thursday.\n\nThe poll also found:\n\n- 59% say her breach of immigration law undermines her ability to enforce the USA's laws; 33% disagree.\n\n- More than half, 56%, say she felt herself above the law.\n\n- 75% don't believe she was telling the truth about being unable to find qualified legal workers to fill the jobs.\n\nThe margin of error is 5%.\n\nAnother indication of trouble: Senators say calls and mail from constituents are running heavily against the \nnomination.\n\nPresident Clinton continues to support her, but appears to be worried: He has phoned senators on her behalf.\n\nAnd spokesman George Stephanopoulos said, ''Right now, Zoe Baird is his nominee.''\n\nHe said Clinton believes she will be an ''excellent attorney general.''\n\nBaird insists she won't withdraw her nomination.\n\nSeveral senators have voiced opposition, including Nancy Kassebaum, R- Kan., the Senate's lone Republican \nwoman, who decided to oppose her with ''deep regret.''\n\nMoseley-Braun, like many other members of the panel, said she's reserving judgment until the confirmation \nhearings conclude, likely next week.\n\nRepublican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, considered a possible swing vote, said her prospects for confirmation \nare ''very much up in the air.''\n\nCommittee questioning was expected to shift today to Baird's husband, Yale law professor Paul Gewirtz.\n\n"}
