{"title": "96 Chinese Held as Illegal Aliens", "body": "\nIn the largest seizure of illegal aliens on record here, 96 Chinese were arrested on Monday when they tried to \nsneak into Honolulu Harbor aboard a Taiwanese fishing boat, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said.\n\nThe boat was boarded by the authorities after she had approached the harbor early in the morning without \npermission to enter.\n\nThe crew had apparently intended to bring the boat just close enough to the dock for the passengers to jump off \nand run, said Donald Radcliffe, district director of the immigration service.\n\n \n\n'Mother Ship' Is Suspected\n\n The 96 passengers, all but two of them men, were charged with trying to enter the United States illegally. They and \nthe nine members of the Taiwanese crew, who are also being held, face the possibility of conspiracy charges, the \nauthorities said.\n\nSome passengers said they boarded the boat, the Yun Fong Seong, three weeks ago near Singapore, and others \nsaid they had boarded in China.\n\nBut Mr. Radcliffe said the passengers might have boarded the vessel, which was designed to hold only 20 people, \nfrom a large freighter in the last few days. The men were clean-shaven and all were wearing clean clothes, he \nnoted, while the boat was filthy. The authorities are looking into whether the passengers had transferred from \n\"mother ships.\"\n\n\"I believe it's an organized smuggling operation,\" Mr. Radcliffe said. \"They're paying a professional smuggler -- or \nrelatives and friends in the United States are paying that smuggler -- to get them into the United States by any \nmeans possible.\"\n"}
