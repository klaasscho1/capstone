Rynearson of the \nInternational Institute. \"It will offer a bird's-eye view of the city - all the stuff the rest of us take for granted, like \npolice service or parks, trash collection or dealing with a problem property.\"\n\nThe fair will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. March 18 at Carpenters Hall, 1401 Hampton Avenue. The federal Office \nof Refugee Resettlement is helping to pay for the fair, Rynearson said.\n\nThe institute will provide interpreters to help people talk with local representatives.\n\nThe fair is open to anyone who has come here from another country but primarily is geared toward refugees. \nPeople are considered refugees if the U.S. government grants them residence because of conditions in their own \ncountries. Usually, that means war.\n\nIn the past five years, the International Institute has settled about 6,000 refugees, most of them from Bosnia. The \ninstitute estimates that about 30,000 refugees and family members live in the St. Louis area.\n\nOrganizations or businesses that want to participate in the fair may call Karen Heitzman of the Association of \nCommunity Organizations at 314-533-9104.\n"}
