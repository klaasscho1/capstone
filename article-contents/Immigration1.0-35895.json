{"title": "AROUND THE NATION;Comment on Aliens Angers Ethnic Leaders", "body": "\nAn immigration official's assertion that one-fourth of the workers in the electronics concerns near here are illegal \naliens has drawn an angry response from Hispanic leaders.\n\n''I think it's a real gross distortion,'' said Esther Medina, executive director of the Mexican American Community \nServices Agency.\n\nFernando Chavez, president of the Mexican-American Political Association, the son of the farm labor leader Cesar \nChavez, called the estimate ''ridiculous'' and ''ludicrous.''\n\nBut Harold Ezell, regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is sticking by his estimate. \nHe says that, if anything, the actual percentage of illegal workers is probably higher.\n\nMr. Ezell issued his estimate Monday as his agency marked the opening of a new office here with 19 arrests in \nraids at two electronic concerns.\n"}
