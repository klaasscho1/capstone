{"title": "53 REFUGEES MAY BE FREED / THEY'VE BEEN HELD SINCE FLEEING CHINA ABOARD THE GOLDEN VENTURE IN 1993.", "body": "\nPresident Clinton on Friday ordered the release of the remaining 53 Chinese refugees held by the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service since their freighter, the Golden Venture, ran aground in New York City in June 1993.\n\nThe White House action will speed an INS review of the detainees - including 40 held at York County Prison - to \nscreen out any who may have committed violent acts during detention.\nAll others were to be released pending an immigration judge's review of their requests for political asylum.\n\nTen of the Golden Venture's 277 passengers died trying to swim ashore, and most who were picked up have been \nreleased with green cards, sent back to China or to another country that granted asylum.\n\nClinton's decision was partly due to the persistence of U.S. Rep. Bill Goodling (R., Pa.).\n"}
