{"title": "LEADERS OF ALIEN SANCTUARY DRIVE SAY INDICTMENTS POSE CHURCH-STATE ISSUE", "body": "\nThe Government says that when it began a 10- month undercover operation this month that resulted in the \nindictment of 16 church workers on 71 counts of transporting and harboring illegal aliens it was nothing more than \nroutine law enforcement.\n\n But those indicted, with support from major religious denominations, insist rather that what is at issue is nothing \nless than an unprecedented legal and moral confrontation between church and state.\n\nIt is the United States, they say, not the pastors, priests, nuns and lay workers that should be on trial for crimes \nagainst the law and against humanity.\n\nThe Government is charging smuggling and harboring illegal aliens fleeing third world poverty. The sanctuary \nmovement says it is assisting political refugees who are in this country legally or would be if the United States \nabided by its laws defining refugee status and by international agreements to which it subscribes.\nIndictment of 16 church workers on 71 counts of transporting and harboring illegal aliens is portrayed by those \nindicted, and their supporters, as unprecedented legal and moral confrontation between church and state in United \nStates; sanctuary movement claims it is assisting people who would be considered political refugees if United \nStatea abided by its laws defining refugee status and by international agreements to which it subscribes; photos \n(M)Infiltration of Churches\n\nThe issue erupted dramatically two weeks ago with the announcement by the Government that two undercover \nagents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, aided by two informers, had infiltrated meetings in Tucson, \nAriz., churches and tape-recorded details of ''an underground railroad'' that had smuggled Central Americans into \nthis country and shielded them from arrest in their churches, homes and ''safe houses'' for more than three years.\n\nSince March 1982, when the Tucson Southside Presbyterian Church, joined by six churches in the Bay Area of \nCalifornia, announced it was taking part in the ''ancient rite of sanctuary,'' more and more churches, now about \n200, have publicly defied Federal immigration authority.\n\nIn addition, an unknown number of churches and other groups with religious affiliation, possibly another 150 to 200, \nare assisting the movement secretly.\n\nIn Tucson, where 14 churches of various denominations have signed a ''covenant of sanctuary,'' leaders of the \nmovement say that as many as 200 church workers, chiefly women and elderly retired people, have shuttled \nCentral Americans from the border ''half-way houses'' to church sanctuaries like Southside Presbyterian. Its pastor, \nthe Rev. John M. Fife, is among those indicted.\n\n\n \n\nAsserting 'the Church's Right'\n\nOn both sides of the Mexican border, sanctuary activists, including ordained people, plan and carry out schemes \nthat include disguises, bogus documents and long, clandestine treks across deserts. They will continue to do it, they \nsay, out of religious conviction.\n\nAfter his indictment two weeks ago, Mr. Fife said, ''We will continue to assert the church's right to administer \nsanctuary to helpless people whose lives hang in the balance every day.''\n\nThe governing bodies or leading councils of several denominations, including the American Baptist Churches, the \nAmerican Lutheran Church, the Disciples of Christ, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United Church of Christ \nand the United Methodist Church, have affirmed their support of the sanctuary movement, as has the American \nFriends Service Committee.\n\nLeaders of the movement justify their defiance of the Federal Government, defiance that could mean five years in \nprison for every undocumented Central American they transport or harbor, on religious, humanitarian and legal \ngrounds.\n\n''I do see it as church versus state, but in a very much different way than we normally see church versus state,'' \nsaid Stephen Cooper, the lawyer for two church workers facing trial in Texas next week on charges of conspiring to \nbring Central Americans into the country.\n\n''I can't remember any time in the past when the Government has tried to invade the churches, tried to tell the \nchurches they can't do things that have always been recognized as within the province of the churches, and tried to \nturn church people into criminals for nonviolent behavior,'' he said.\n\n''They are willing to feed these people, they are willing to provide them places to stay, they're willing to assume all \nresponsibiity so it's no burden on anybody else. But what they're not willing to do is to leave them to be killed.''\n\n \n\n'These Are Aliens to Us'\n\nBut United States Attorney A. Melvin McDonald said in announcing the indictments that ''merely because they \nwear the garb of the clergy, they have no greater or no lesser rights than anyone else.'' Assistant United States \nAttorney Donald M. Reno, Jr., the leading prosecutor in the Arizona cases, dismissed suggestions of political or \nreligious overtones.\n\n''Government people are really not motivated by any personal vendetta against any particular political or religious \npersuasion,'' he said. ''The Government is virtually blind as far as those factors are concerned. Rhese are aliens to \nus. This is an alien smuggling conspiracy.''\n\nSanctuary workers say they are seeking to alleviate suffering caused in part by United States policy in Central \nAmerica.\n\n''In the particular case of El Salvador,'' said Mr. Cooper, ''there is no doubt that the bullets that are going into the \nheads of the people are provided by the United States, there is no doubt that the helicopters that dropped the \nbombs on the houses of the people are made by the United States.''\n\nBoth the Government and those who defy it agree that the governing law is the Refugee Act of 1980. They differ \nprofoundly on its interpretation.\n\nThe law defines a refugee legally entitled to stay in this country as someone who is ''unwilling or unable to return'' to \nhis homeland ''because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.''\n\n\n\n \n\nFear of Persecution Cited\n\nSanctuary workers say that the vast majority of the more than 500,000 Central Americans, chiefly Guatemalans \nand Salvadorans, who have fled to the United States have at the very least ''a well-founded fear'' of persecution.\n\nAmong those supporting that view is Representative Morris K. Udall, who urged that Salvadorans be granted \ntemporary legal residence.\n\nSaying he was ''deeply troubled'' by the indictments of the sanctuary workers, Representative Udall maintained \nthat ''the aliens in question are refugees, many of them women and children, from a war-torn country.''\n\n''Since 1979,'' he went on, ''over 40,000 people have been murdered in El Salvador, many of them by so-called \ndeath squads and many by government troops. Thousands more have been swept up into the ongoing war. Entire \nvillage have been destroyed. Whole families have been wiped out.''\n\n \n\nAn Appeal on Long Island\n\nOn Long Island this week, the principal cleric of the Presbytery of Long Island, representing 58 Presbyterian \nchurches and more than 20,000 members, has called on local parishes and congregants to provide sanctuary for \nCentral American people.\n\nThere was no immediate response by churches on the Island to the appeal by the Rev. Stark Jones, moderator of \nthe Presbytery and pastor of the Roslyn Presbyterian Church. He and others who support sanctuary say that many \nparishioners feel uncomfortable with the issue. But they have expressed confidence that, in time, attitudes will \nevolve and moy sanctuaries will be found in homes and houses of worship.\n\nSupporters of the sanctuary movement say they transport and hide Central Americans in their homes and \nchurches because applying for refugee status is tantamount to being sent back home almost immediately.\n\nIn the fiscal year 1984, the Immigration and Naturalization Service processed 13,373 applications for political \nasylum by Salvadorans. It denied 13,045 applications and granted 328.\n\nOf those denied, said Vern Jervis, a spokesman for the immigration service in Washington, about 4,000 were \nreturned to El Salvador. Most of the remainder appealed for a new hearing by the service or in the courts as \nprovided by law.\n\nAccording to Mr. Jervis, the number of Salvadorans deported has been declining - 8,800 in 1980; 10,500 in 1981; \n5,600 in 1982; and 4,800 in 1983.\n\n \n\nU.N. Pact Is Pointed Out\n\nSanctuary supporters maintain that returning any to El Salvador at present is illegal under the United Nations \nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which forbids forcibly returning a refugee to a country ''where his life \nor freedom would be treatened'' because of race, religion, or politics.\n\nThe imigration service says most Central Americans who come into this country come for economic rather than \npolitical reasons. Mr. Jervis said it was ''extremely difficult'' to assess applicants for political asylum.\n\nOn Jan. 4, in San Francisco, the service decided the case of a 29-year-old Salvadoran who had petitioned for \npolitical asylum maintaining that because he had participated in the Salvadoran teachers' union, he had been \narrested and tortured with acid, and a brother had been kidnapped, tortured and decapitated.\n\n \n\nAmnesty International Looks In\n\n\n\nHis petition was supported by doctors for Amnesty International, the London-based organization that campaigns for \nthe rights of political prisoners. The doctors corroborated the Salvadoran's assertion that he had been burned with \nacid, and the service did not contest the Salvadorann's assertions.\n\nBut it ruled as follows: ''The applicant has described the suffering which he and other family members had \nunfortunately endured during the civil strife in El Salvador, suffering which has been similarly experienced by other \ngroups and political factions operation in El Salvador.\n\n''The problems of the applicant and his family members, however, do not stem from persecution but from the civil \nstrife which has torn El Salvador apart over the past five to nine years. The tragedy of El Salvador is that the \nsuffering, the armed kidnapping and other excesses are not confined to one particular group but are endured and \nperpetrated by all.\n\n''For these reasons, the applicant has failed to establish that he qualifies as a refugee.''\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto of the Rev.
