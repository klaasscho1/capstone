Our hearings are open to the public and to the \ninterested public, of course, as the champion of the ADA and the American's with Disabilities Act.  I've done \neverything possible to accommodate the persons with disabilities who informed us yesterday that they would be \nattending the hearing.\n\nNow, in fact, when we received word that there would be three deaf people in attendance, we immediately arranged \nan interpreter for them.  When we were informed that up to 100 people with disabilities would be coming, we \nimmediately began looking throughout the building for additional suitable room to accommodate all of them.\n\nAs background, the committee practices to allow the public to attend hearings on a first come, first service basis, \nand often many of the people who wait in line never get in.  Rather than follow the usual practice and have most \npeople in the hallways, we instead reserved STG50, a spacious first floor room for any guests who could not be \naccommodated in the hearing room.\n\nNow, we're very disappointed that we were unable to get S216, which would have been a bigger room and would \nhave allowed us, perhaps, to get everybody in.  I've asked my staff to look at STG50 and see how full it is and see if \nwe can accommodate everybody down there because we could immediately move down there if it is.  But, our \nproblem is all the television is set up and everything right now. But, we'll check on it and we'll see what we can do \nbecause I'm the last person on earth who would not want to accommodate those who are suffering from -- or those \nwho are persons with disabilities.\n\nSo, we'll start here and we'll check out that room.  If it's capable of handling this we'll try to accommodate if we can \nmove everything down there.  But, as of right now, I think we're going to have to proceed here until I receive back \nword from staff.  And, I would like your staff to work with\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Yes, I would.  I've already asked my staff to go down and look at STG50.  When I went by there earlier this \nmorning, it's a huge room.  I think it would probably accommodate.  We got people standing out here for an hour \nwaiting.  And, maybe one way to do it would be to have the starters who are here to make their (inaudible) do it. \nBut, I would really strongly urge that we move down there.  It's a much larger room and it'd be a lot easier to \naccommodate some people who have not been able to get in.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I think that's a\u2026\n\n(UNKNOWN): I just hope that you'll follow the recommendations\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(UNKNOWN): I think that's a reasonable way to proceed in terms of hearing from the presenters here.  And, then, \nas I understand as well, that ST50 is open and is available.  And, it seems to me that we ought to give the \nopportunity for people who have an interest in these nominees an opportunity to hear them.  So, I support Senator \nLeahy's proposal and hope that that can be\u2026\n\n\n\nHATCH: (Inaudible) that comment and I think I'm certainly amendable to that.  So, let's have, Senator Leahy's staff \nand my staff do down there and see if we can accommodate us down there.  If we can't, we're going to continue \nhere.  If we can, we'll move down there with this batch, because I'm not going to waste a lot of time moving. So, \neverybody's just going to have to move down as quickly as they can.  But, I certainly want to always accommodate \nas many people as we possibly can, and especially those who suffer from disabilities.  And, we'll just do it that way.\n\nWe can make our two statements and then we'll have the two Senators make theirs or any other Senators who \nwant to come at this time.\n\nGood morning. I'm pleased to welcome all of you to the committee's first judicial confirmation hearing of the 108th \nCongress. I first would like to acknowledge and thank Senator Leahy for his service as chairman of this committee \nover the past 16 months.  I also would like to extend a particular welcome to Senator Bob Dole, our former majority \nleader, and to Commissioner Russell Redenbaugh, the three-term U.S. Civil Rights commissioner, who also \nhappens to be the first disabled American to serve on that commission.  It means a great deal to me that they are \nboth here today to support Mr. Jeff Sutton's nomination.  And, of course, I would also like to express my deep \nappreciation for the members we have here who have taken time to come and present their views on the \nqualifications of our witnesses today.\n\nOur first panel features three outstanding circuit nominees who were nominated on May 9, 2001, whose hearing \nwas originally noticed for May 23, 2001.  I agreed to postpone that hearing for a week at the request of some of my \ndemocratic colleagues who claim that an additional week -- they needed an additional week to assess the \nnominees' qualifications.  As we all know, control of the senate and the committee shifted to the democrats shortly \nthereafter on June 5, 2001.  And, these nominees have been languishing in the committee without a hearing ever \nsince. So, I am particularly pleased to pick up where we left off in May of 2001 by holding our first confirmation \nhearing for the same three nominees we noticed back then: Justice Deborah Cook, Jeffrey Sutton and John \nRoberts.  It is with great pleasure that I welcome these distinguished guests before the committee this morning.\n\nWe also have three very impressive district court nominees with us today: John Adams for the Northern District of \nOhio; Robert Junell for the Western District of Texas and S. James Otero for the Central District of California.  I will \nreserve my remarks about these district court nominees until I call their panel forward.\n\nOur first nominee is Ohio Supreme Court Justice, Deborah Cook, who has established a distinguished record as \nboth a litigator and a jurist.  Justice Cook began her legal career in 1976 as a law clerk for the firm now known as \nRoderick Linton, which is Akron's oldest law firm.  Upon her graduation from the University of Akron's School of \nLaw in 1978, Justice Cook became the first women hired by that firm.\n\nIn 1983 she became the first female partner in the firm's century of existence.  And, I'm proud to have her before us \nas a nominee who knows firsthand the difficulties and challenges the professional women face in breaking through \nthe glass ceiling.\n\nDuring her personally 15 years in the private sector, Justice Cook has a large and diverse civil litigation practice.  \nShe represented both plaintiffs and defendants at trial and on appeal in cases involving, for example, labor law, \ninsurance claims, commercial litigation, torts and ERISA claims.  In 1991 Justice Cook left the private sector after \nwinning election to serve as a judge on the Ninth Ohio District Court of Appeals.  During her four years on the Ninth \nDistrict bench, she participated in deciding over 1,000 appeals.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court reversed only six of the opinions that she authored, and eight of the opinions on which \nshe joined.\n\nHATCH: In 1994, Justice Cook was elected to serve as the Justice on the Ohio Supreme Court. She, therefore, \nbrings to the federal bench more than 10 years of appellant judicial experience, which is built on a foundation of 15 \nyears of solid and diverse litigation experience.  There can be little doubt that she is imminently qualified to be a \nSixth Circuit jurist and I commend President Bush on his selection of her for this post.\n\n\n\nOur next nominee is Jeff Sutton, one of the most respected appellate advocates in the country today.  He has \nargued over 45 appeals for a diversity of clients in federal and state courts across the country, including a \nremarkable number, 12 to be exact, before the U.S. Supreme Court.  His remarkable skill and pleasant demeanor \nhave won him not only a lot of decisions, but also a wide variety of prominent supporters including Seth Waxman, \nPresident Clinton's Solicitor General, Benson Wolman, the former head of the Ohio ACLU; Bonnie Campbell, the \nClinton nominee to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Civil Rights Commissioner Redenbaugh, the first disabled \nAmerican to serve on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission; and former Senate Majority Leader, Bob Dole, who is \namong the country's most powerful advocates on behalf of persons with disabilities.\n\nI feel it necessary for me to comment briefly on some of the recent criticisms we have heard.  Of course, no one \nfamiliar with the nominees' nominations process is surprised.  We have the usual gang opposing Republican \nnominees.  Well, their opposition of Jeff Sutton is for all of the wrong reasons.  But, as people who know me well \nwill attest, I have always been willing to acknowledge a fair point made by the opposition.\n\nSo, in keeping with that principle, I want everyone to know that I found something commendable in the so-called \nreport published by one of these groups about Jeff Sutton.  And that report concluded -- or conceded that quote, \n\"No one has seriously contended that Sutton is personally biased against people with disabilities.\" Now, that is a \nvery important point, and should be obvious since Jeff Sutton has a well-known record of fighting for the legal \nrights of persons with disabilities.\n\nAnd, he was raised in an environment of concern for the disabled. His father ran a school for people affected by \ncerebral palsy.  Since the opposition to Jeff Sutton is not personal, then what is it?  It seems to come down to a \npublic policy disagreement about some Supreme Court decisions regulating the limits to federal power when \nCongress seeks to regulate state governments.  Those cases include the City of Boerne, Kimel, and Garrett, among \nothers.  But, in those cases it was Jeffrey Sutton's job as the Chief Appellate lawyer for the State of Ohio and as a \nlawyer to defend his clients' legal interests.\n\nAs the American Bar Association ethics rules make clear, \"A lawyer's representation of a client, including \nrepresentation by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client's political, economic, social or \nmoral views or activities.\" Now, I don't think anyone on this committee would actually consider voting against a \nnominee out of dislike for the nominee's clients.\n\nWe have an important discussion about clients in connection with the confirmation of Marsha Berzon, now a judge \non the Ninth Circuit who was born in Ohio, by the way.  And, this committee ultimately decided not to hold her \nresponsible for her clients' views.  Judge Berzon had been a long-time of the ACLU, serving on the Board of \nDirectors as the vice president of the Northern California Branch. She testified that, \"If I am confirmed as a judge, \nnot only will the ACLU's positions be irrelevant, but the positions of my former clients, and indeed my own positions \non any policy matters will be quite irrelevant, and I will be required to, and I commit to look at, the statute, the \nconstitution of provisions and the precedence only in deciding the case.\" That was on July 30, 1998.\n\nNow, I want to remind my colleagues that that answer sufficed for Judge Berzon, and she was approved by this \ncommittee with my support and confirmed by the Senate.  It took longer than I would have liked to -- it to have \ntaken, but she was approved.  I think we all agree that anybody involved in a legal dispute has a right to hire a \ngood lawyer, even if that person is guilty of murder.  And, Jeff's clients are not murders.  They are state \ngovernments defending their legal rights.  So, let's not beat up on Mr. Sutton because he worked for the State of \nOhio.\n\nOf course I'm not suggesting that committee members must praise the effects of the Supreme Court's rulings in the \nCity of Boerne, Kimel, and Garrett.  Those decisions affected real people and undid some of the hard work on the \npart of Congress. I should know.  A number of us on this committee and certainly Senator Kennedy and I did -- we \ndid a lot of work on those cases.  We put in a great deal of time and energy into drafting and passing the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws that have been declared beyond \nfederal power, including the Violence Against Women Act, which Senator Biden spent so much time on and myself.\n\n\n\nI thought those laws would be good for the country and they still are.  It was not easy to see them limited or struck \ndown.  Of course I understand the powerful constitutional principles and underpinning of the Supreme Court's \ndecisions in those cases.  But, I can sympathize with those who see things differently.  I have no sympathy, \nhowever, for the notion that those Supreme Court decisions and the positions of the states that were Mr. Sutton's \nclients have somehow a legitimate reason to oppose Mr. Sutton's nomination.  That's ridiculous.\n\nSo, since even the people for the American way concedes that Jeff Sutton harbors no personal bias.  And, since \nMr. Sutton cannot be held responsible for the Supreme Court's decisions and since we all agree that Ohio and \nAlabama and Florida have the right to representation in court, then I do not see any real reason to oppose this \nhighly skilled and highly qualified and highly rated lawyer by the ABA.  I do look forward to his testimony and would \nonly urge my colleagues and observers to keep an open mind.\n\nFrom the record I have observed so far I am convinced that Jeff Sutton will be a great judge and one who \nunderstands the proper role of a judge.\n\nOur final circuit nominee today is Mr. John Roberts, who has been nominated for a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals.  He is widely considered to be one of the premiere appellate litigators of his generation. Most lawyers are \nheld in high esteem if they have the privilege of arguing even one case before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Mr. \nRoberts has argued an astounding 39 cases before the Supreme Court, at least that was the last count I had.\n\nIt is truly an honor to have such an accomplished litigator before this committee, and one of the most well \nrecognized and approved appellate litigators in history.  The high esteem in which Mr. Roberts is held is reflected in \na letter the committee recently received urging his confirmation.  This letter, which I will submit for the record was \nsigned by more than 150 members of the D.C. Bar, including such well-respected attorneys as Lloyd Cutler, who \nwas the White House Counsel to both Presidents Carter and Clinton; Boyden Gray, who was the White House \nCounsel for the first President Bush; and Seth Waxman who was President Clinton's Solicitor General.  The letter \nstates, \"Although as individuals we reflect a wide spectrum of political party affiliation and ideology, we are united in \nour belief that John Roberts will be an outstanding Federal Court of Appeals judge and should be confirmed by the \nUnited States Senate.  He is one of the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in the nation with a \ndeserved reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate.  He is also a wonderful professional colleague, both \nbecause of his enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity and fair mindedness.\"\n\nThis is high praise from a group of lawyers who themselves have clearly excelled in their profession, who are not \neasily impressed, and who would not recklessly put their reputations on the line by issuing such a sterling \nendorsement if they were not 100 percent convinced that John Roberts will be a fair judge who will follow the law \nregardless of his personal beliefs.\n\nLet me just say a brief word about Mr. Roberts' background before turning to Senator Leahy.  He graduated from \nHarvard College, summa cum laude in 1976 and received his law degree magna cum laude in 1979 from the \nHarvard Law School where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.  Following graduation, he served \nas a law clerk for Second Circuit Judge Henry J. Friendly, and for then Justice William Rehnquist of the Supreme \nCourt.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1986 Roberts served as Associate Counsel to the President in the White House Counsel's office.  \nFrom 1989 to 1993, he served as Principle Deputy Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice.  He now \nheads the Appellate Practice Group at the prestigious D.C. law firm Hogan and Hartson.  And, he has received the \nABA's highest rating of unanimously well qualified.  I have to say that this panel represents the best.  And I \ncommend President Bush for seeking out such nominees of the highest caliber.\n\nNow, I just have a note here; let me see what it says and then I'll turn.  OK, for everybody's information I have been \nadvised that we can set up in another large room.  We will proceed here until the other room is ready for us, at \nwhich time we will take a short recess and accommodate further the request made yesterday for additional \naccommodations.\n\n\n\nSo, I would prefer that and even though it's an inconvenience to all of you, let's see if we can try and get at least \nthese folks into that room first because they were here first, as well as those persons with disabilities who desire to \nattend and we'll -- does anybody know what the room is?  STG50 will be the room.  So, apparently we can hold it \nthere.\n\nLEAHY: I just thank the Chair for the accommodation.  I appreciate it.\n\nHATCH: Well, that's fine.\n\nLEAHY: Chairman, I think it was\u2026\n\nHATCH: Let me turn to the Ranking Member for his remarks.\n\nLEAHY: I think it was a wise thing to do.  As I said when I walked by there, there appeared to be plenty of room.  I'm \nwondering, Mr. Chairman -- I'm wondering if we're going to be moving down there anyway, and Senator Warner and \nSenator Hutchison, I'd just as soon withhold my statement until we go down there to give as a courtesy to Senator \nWarner and Hutchison and Senator Voinovich because if they want to give their statement here and then I'll give my \nopening statement down there.\n\nHATCH: I'd prefer for you to give your opening statement and then we'll hear from the two Senators.\n\nLEAHY: OK.  Happy to do that, Mr. Chairman.  We meet an extraordinary -- I tried.\n\nHATCH: I think my colleagues understand.\n\nLEAHY: No, I -- they're -- I know they're anxious to hear my statement anyway.\n\nHATCH: Well, I'm certainly anxious to hear\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Following the chairman's example would be a little bit lengthy.  We meet in an extraordinary session to \nconsider six important nominees for lifetime appointments to the federal bench. During the last four years of the \nClinton Administration, this committee refused to hold hearings and committee votes on qualified nominees to the \nD.C. Circuit and the Sixth Circuit.  Today, in very sharp contrast, the committee's being required to proceed on \nthree controversial nominations for those same Circuit Courts and do it simultaneously.\n\nMany see this as part of a concerted and partisan effort to pack the courts and tilt them sharply out of balance.  In \ncontrast to the president's Circuit Court nominees, the District Court nominees to vacancies in California, Texas and \nOhio seem to be more moderate and bipartisan.  Today we'll hear from Judge Otero, nominated to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Central District of California unanimously approved by California's bipartisan judicial advisory \ncommittee established through an agreement between Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer with the White House.\n\nI wish the White House would proceed to nominate another qualified consensus nominee like Judge Otero for the \nremaining vacancy in California.  Because too often the last two years we've seen the recommendations of such \nbipartisan panels rejected or stalled at the White House.  I note that Judge Otero's contributed to the community, \nworked on a pro bono project for the Mexican Legal Defense and Education Fund, served as a member of the \nMexican Bar Association, the Stanford Chicano Alumni Association, and the California Latino Judge's Association, \namong others.\n\nWe will hear from Robert Junell, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, another \nconsensus nominee who has a varied career at litigator and member of the Texas House of Representative, a life \nmember of the NAACP, and a former member of the Board of Directors of La Esperanza Clinic.  And, I spoke earlier \nwith Representative Charlie Stenholm who strongly supported him.\n\nAnd, then, of course, Judge Adams, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. These are \nnot the ones that create the controversy.  And, I'm disappointed the chairman has unilaterally chosen to pack so \nmany Circuit Court nominees onto the docket of a single hearing.  This is certainly unprecedented in his earlier \n\n\n\ntenure as chairman.  And, there's simply no way to consider the controversial divisive nominations in a single \nhearing.\n\nIt is not the way to discharge our constitutional duty to advise and consent to the president's nominees.  When I \nwas chairman over 17 months we reformed the process of judicial nomination hearings.\n\nLEAHY: We made tangible progress in repairing the damage done to the process in the previous six years.  We \nshowed how nominations are viewed, public and present, could be considered twice as quickly in a democratic \ncontrolled Senate, as a republican controlled Senate they considered President Clinton's nominees.\n\nWe added new accountability by making the positions of home state Senators public for the first time and we did \naway with the previous republican process of anonymous holds.  We made significant progress and happened to fill \njudgeships in the last Congress.  The number of vacancies on the courts was slashed from 110 to 59, despite an \nadditional 50 new vacancies that arose during that time.  Chairman Hatch had written in September 1997 that 103 \nvacancies as we joined the Clinton Administration did not constitute a vacancy crisis.  He also stated his position on \nnumerous occasions as 67 vacancies meant full employment in the federal court.  Even with the two additional \nvacancies that have risen since the beginning of the year, there are now 61 vacancies on the district and circuit \ncourts.  Under a democratic controlled Senate, we went well below the level that Chairman Hatch used to consider \nacceptable and the federal courts have more judges now than when Chairman Hatch proclaimed them in full \nemployment.\n\nWe made the extraordinary progress we did by holding hearings on consensus nominees with widespread support \nmoving them quickly, but, by also recognizing that this president's more divisive judicial nominees would take time.  \nWe urged the White House to consult in a bipartisan way and to keep the courts out of politics and partisan \nideology.  We urge the president to be a uniter, not a divider, when it came to our federal courts.  We were rebuffed \nin that.  All Americans need to be able to have confidence in the courts and judges. And, they need to maintain the \nindependence necessary to rule fairly on the laws and rights of the American people to be free from discrimination, \nto have our environmental consumer protection laws upheld.\n\nUnder democratic leadership in the Senate, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees within 17 months; two \nothers were rejected by a majority vote of this committee.  Several others were controversial.  They had a number \nof negative votes, but they were confirmed. And, given all the competing responsibilities with the committee and the \nSenate in these times of great challenges to our nation, especially after the attacks of September 11, then later the \nanthrax attacks directed at Senator Daschle and myself, in fact, it killed several people and disrupted the operations \nof the Senate itself.  Hearings for 103 judicial nominees, voting on 102 and favorably reporting a 100 in 17 months \nis a record we can be proud of and one that I would challenge anybody to show certainly in recent years to be \nmatched.\n\nDuring the 107th Congress the committee voted 102 of the 103 judicial nominees eligible for votes, that's 99 \npercent.  Of those voted upon, 98 percent were reported favorably to the Senate, of those, 100 percent were \nconfirmed.  Incidentally, we completed the hearings on 94 percent of the judges that had their files completed.\n\nNow this, 103 judges heard in 17 months is contrast to the less than 40 a year that the Republicans had when they \nhad President Clinton as president.  Indeed, they failed to proceed on 79 of President Clinton's judicial nominees in \nthe two-year Congress in which they were nominated.  More than 50 of them were never even given a hearing.  \nIndeed, the Senate confirmed more judicial nominees in our 17 months than the republican controlled Senate did \nduring 30 months. More achieved in half the time, but achieved responsibly.  We showed how steady progress \ncould be made without sacrificing fairness.\n\nBut, in contrast this hearing today portends real dangers to the process and to the results, all to the detriment of our \ncourts and to the protections they are intended to afford to the American people. The Senate in this instance and \nthe Congress in many others is supposed to act as a check on the executive and add balance to the process, the \nproceeding that the majority as unilaterally chosen today is unprecedented, it's wrong.  It undercuts the ability of the \ncommittee and the Senate to provide balance.\n\n\n\nThree controversial circuit nominations of a republican president for a single hearing.  That is something the \nchairman, current chairman, it is something he never did for the moderate and relatively non-controversial \nnominees of a democratic president just a few years ago.  One has to think it's a headlong effort to pack the courts \nand not withstanding our efforts not to carry out the same obstruction as we saw with the democratic president.  We \nseem to be going back to a different rules for different presidents.\n\nJeffrey Sutton's nomination has generated significant controversy and opposition.  I have questions about his efforts \nto challenge and weaken among other laws, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the AIDS Discrimination \nEmployment Act, the Violence Against Women Act, as perceived general empathy to the federal protection for state \nworkers. I am concerned that more than 500 disability rights groups, civil rights groups and women's groups are \nopposed to his confirmation because they feel he will act against their interest and not protect their rights.\n\nI am concerned about a reputation among observers of the legal community that he's a leading advocate for the \nstate's rights revival. This is a nomination that deserves serious scrutiny and which ought to be considered -- it has \nbeen the practice, has been the practice for decades in this committee as the only circuit court nominee in this \nhearing.  The process imposed my friends on the other side of the aisle as cheating the American people to the \nscrutiny of these nominees should be accorded.\n\nWe're also being asked to simultaneously consider the nomination of Deborah Cook.  She's one of the most active \ndissenters on the Ohio Supreme Court.  She comes to the committee with the judicial record deserving of some \nscrutiny.  And it's also generated a good deal of controversy and opposition as well.\n\nAnd, I'd note that these two difficult nominations of both the judgeships and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, now \nthat is a court to which President Clinton had a much harder time getting his nominees considered.\n\nThe Republicans fail to acknowledge that most of the vacancies that have plagued the Sixth Circuit arose during the \nClinton Administration when President Clinton had nominated people to this court and they were never even given a \nhearing.  The republicans closed the gates.  They refused to consider any of the three highly qualified moderate \nnominees President Clinton sent to the Senate for those vacancies. Not one of the Clinton nominees for those \ncurrent vacancies on the Sixth Circuit received a hearing by the Judiciary Committee under Republican leadership \nfrom 1997 through June of 2001.\n\nNow, in spite of that history, when the Democrats took over, we gave committee consideration and we confirmed \ntwo of President Bush's conservative nominees to that court last year.  We did not play tit for tat.  With the \nconfirmations of Judge Julia Smith Gibbons of Tennessee, Professor John Marshal Rogers of Kentucky, Democrats \nconfirmed the only two new judges to the Sixth Circuit in the past five years.  Regrettably, despite our best efforts, \nthe White House rejected all suggestions to address the legitimate concerns the Senators in that circuit.  The \nqualified moderate nominees were blocked by the Republicans when they were in charge.\n\nThe Republican majority refused to hold hearings on the nomination of Judge Helene White, of Kathleen McCree \nLewis, Professor Kent Markus.  One of those seats has been vacant since 1995, the first term of President Clinton.  \nJudge Helene White of the Michigan Court of Appeals was nominated in January of 1997.  She did not receive a \nhearing on her nomination during the more than 1,500 days her nomination was before this committee.  That \nprobably set a record, four years, 51 months in fact, no hearing.  She was one of 79 president judicial nominees \nwho did not get a hearing during the Congress in which she was first nominated.  And then she was denied a \nhearing after being re-nominated a number of times, including January 2001.  Actually, the committee under \nRepublican control had only about eight Court of Appeals nominees a year that they heard, in 2000 they only held \nfive, as contrasted today when the Republican president they'll hold three in one day.\n\nWe had Kathleen McCree Lewis, a distinguished African American lawyer from a prestigious Michigan law firm was \nnever accorded a hearing on her 1999 nomination to the Sixth Circuit.  And that nomination was final withdrawn by \nPresident Bush.  Professor Kent Markus, another outstanding nominee to a vacancy of the Sixth Circuit, never \nreceived a hearing on his nomination.  And, while his nomination was pending his confirmation was supported by \nindividuals of every political stripe, including 14 past presidents of the Ohio State Bar Association, and more than 80 \nprofessors and groups like the National District Attorney's Association, of course every newspaper in the state.  \n\n\n\nNow, Professor Markus did say in testimony another hearing how what happened to him, here's some of the things \nhe said.  On February 9, 2000, I was the president's first judicial nominee in that calendar year, and then the waiting \nbegan.  At the time my nomination was pending, despite lower vacancy rates in the Sixth Circuit in calendar year \n2000, the Senate confirmed circuit nominees to the Third, Ninth and Federal Circuit, no Sixth Circuit nominee was \ngiven a hearing. With more vacancies in the way, why then did my nomination expire without even a hearing?  And, \nthen to quote him, \"To their credit, Senator Dewine and his staff and Senator Hatch's staff and others close to him \nwere straight to me.  Over and over again they told me two things, there will be no more confirmations of the Sixth \nCircuit during the Clinton Administration.  This has nothing to do with you personally.  It doesn't matter who the \nnominee is, what his potential they may have, or what support they may have, they're not going to be heard.\" \nProfessor Markus has identified some of the other side of the aisle have these seats open for years for a republican \npresident to fill instead of proceeding fairly.\n\nThat's why there's now so many vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. Had Republicans not blocked President Clinton's \nnominees to the Sixth Circuit, and the three Democratic nominees had been confirmed that President Bush had \nappointed the judges to the other vacancies on the Sixth Circuit, that court would be almost evenly balanced \nbetween judges appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents. And, that's why the Republicans blocked it.  \nThey do not want balance.  And, the same is true of a number of other circuits.\n\nThe former Chief judge of the Sixth Circuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt wrote to the Judiciary Committee chairman years \nago to ask that nominees get hearings.  He predicted by the time the next president is inaugurated, there'll be six \nvacancies on the Court of Appeals; almost half the court will be vacant.  But, no Sixth Circuit hearings were held in \nthe last three, four years of the Clinton Administration, almost the entire second presidential term, despite these \npleas.  And, when I scheduled the April 2001 hearing on President Bush's nomination of Judge Gibbons to the Sixth \nCircuit, it was the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit nomination in almost five years, even though there'd been three \npending for President Clinton that had never got heard.  And, we confirmed Judge Gibbons by a vote of 95 to \nnothing.\n\nBut, we didn't stop there.  We proceeded to hold this hearing on a second Sixth Circuit nominee just a few short \nmonths later, Professor Rogers.  He, too, was confirmed.  It was very similar to what had happened in the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the nation's circuit plays a significant role in environment areas, \nOSHA, the National Labor Relations Board, there, again, President Clinton's nominees were not allowed to be \nheard, although we did hold a hearing for one of President Bush's last year.\n\nAllen Schneider (ph), of the law partner of Mr. Roberts, a former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist, he was never \nallowed a committee vote.  Republicans refused to give Professor Elena Kagan, another D.C. circuit nominee, a \nhearing during the 18 months she was pending. Today's nominee to the D.C. circuit, John Roberts, worked in the \nReagan Justice Department, the Reagan White House for the former Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, it's obvious \nthe Bush Administration feels far more comfortable with him.\n\nAlso, home state Senators have not, I understand have not been consulted in these judges -- we're not certain \nthey've not received any blue slips back.  I think the American -- what we're doing is we're appointing people to the \nhighest courts in the land, no more attention and scrutiny then we've paid to appoint these for a temporary federal \ncommission.  It's a disservice to the American people.  The American people can be excused for sensing that \nthere's a smell of an inkpad in the air, rubber stamps already out of the drawer.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Thank you, Senator Leahy.\n\nWe'll have order in the room.  We'll turn to -- Yes, sir?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I know we don't have opening statements, and I don't want to get into any \nof the substance here.  But, I would ask that a letter that a number of us signed to you\u2026\n\nHATCH: We'll put both your letter\u2026\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN): \u2026 we ask that the record.  And, I just make this point, we received noticed of who the witnesses \nwould be at 4:45 yesterday.  It does not give anyone any chance to prepare.  The committee hasn't organized.  We \ndon't have rules.  You're changing the rule of the tradition of the blue slip, but we don't know what it is.\n\nThis is just being rushed beyond -- aside from the fact, which Senator Leahy dealt with in terms of the three \nnominees.  Now, we've received notice for a hearing next Tuesday. We don't know who is going to be on the \nhearing, and there's a rule in the committee of a one-week notice.  And, so, there's just a tremendous rush to \njudgment here that is just not fair.  We know we have differences on these nominees.  But, all the procedures seem \nto be being ripped up in an effort to rush things through.\n\nAnd I would just ask that you give the letter that we sent you some consideration.  It is not fair to tell us at 4:45 last \nnight as to who the witnesses were going to be.  On important judges like this, it is important that we get a chance \nto prepare.  And I would just urge that in the future, this policy or whatever it is be reexamined. We have no chance, \nno chance to adequately prepare and if the impression that Senator Leahy said that we're just trying to rush things \nthrough without thorough examination is rankling some people, it's no wonder, because of all these things.  It's just \nnot right for us.\n\nAnd, I would ask you really give consideration to the letter, as you were generous enough to move the room as well.  \nWe're going to have an awful time over the next year if we are not going to get an adequate chance to prepare, to \nask questions fully, et cetera.  And, that's not -- I know it's not been your way in the past.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHATCH: Well, I appreciate the Senator's remarks.  Certainly, your letter will go into the record and our response to \nyour letter will go into the record as well.  And, I intended to put them in the record.  Also, I've been announcing for \ntwo weeks who the witnesses are.  They've been waiting 630 days.  I think that's adequate time to prepare.  But, on \nthe other hand, if there is a problem here, I'm going to solve it for you.  We'll try and give better notice.  But, our \nobligation that gives notice of the hearing, sometimes it's very difficult to adjust and get people, you know, prepared \nand there. But, I'll certainly take your comments into consideration.\n\nLet's turn to Senator Warner and then Senator Hutchison.  And, then Senator Voinovich and then, of course, we \nhave Senator Dewine, who also, along with Senator Voinovich, has two Ohio State judges and then Senator \nFeinstein, if you'd care to make your remarks about your judge here today, or we could do it right before they call\u2026\n\nFEINSTEIN: (OFF-MIKE)\n\nHATCH: I'll accommodate you.  I'll accommodate you.\n\nFEINSTEIN: I'd be happy to, since I'm going to be here, I'd be happy to let the other Senators\u2026\n\nHATCH: And, then wait until your judge is called?\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yes.  Right.\n\nHATCH: That'll be fine.\n\nSenator Warner?\n\nWARNER: Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy and members of the committee, I'll ask to submit my statement for the \nrecord.  Three reasons, first as a courtesy to the committee and to our guests how have been very patient.  \nSecondly, this nominee, John Roberts, is indeed one of the most outstanding that I've ever had the privilege of \npresenting on behalf of a president in my 25 years in the United States Senate.  His record needs no enhancement \nby this humble Senator, I assure you.\n\nSo, I ask that the committee receive this nomination.  He's accompanied by his wife, Jane, his children, Josephine \nand John, who've been unusually quiet and we thank you very much, and patient, his parents and his sisters.\n\n\n\nMr. Chairman, and members of the committee, just if I may indulge a personal observation, Mr. Roberts is \ndesignated to serve on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  Exactly one half century ago, 50 \nyears, I was a clerk on that court, and, so I take a particularly interest in presenting this nominee.  Also, the \nnominee is a member of the firm of Hogan and Hartson, one of the leading firms in the nation's capital.  50 years \nago, I was a member of that firm.  And, I just reminisced with the nominee, I was the 34th lawyer in that firm, which \nwas one of the largest in the nation's capital.  Today there are 1,000 members of that law firm, to show you the \nchange in the practice of law in the half century that I've been a witness to this.\n\nMr. Chairman, you've covered in your opening remarks every single fact that I had hopefully desired to inform the \ncommittee.  So, again, for that reason you have most courteously, Mr. Chairman, stated all the pertinent facts about \nthis extraordinary man, having graduated from Harvard, summa cum laude in '76; three years later he graduated \nfrom Harvard School magna cum laude where he served as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.  Those of \nwho pursued the practice of law know that few of us could have ever attained that status.  Even if I went back, \nstarted all over again, I couldn't do it.\n\nHe served as law clerk to Judge Friendly on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and worked \nas a law clerk to the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court today, Judge Rehnquist, Justice Rehnquist.  So, I \ncommend the president.  I commend this nominee.  I'm hopeful that the committee will judiciously and fairly \nconsider this nomination and that the senate will give us advice and consent for this distinguished American to \nserve as a part of our judicial branch.\n\nI thank the chair and members of the committee.\n\nHATCH: We appreciate it.\n\nSenator Hutchison?\n\nHUTCHISON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n\nI'm very pleased to introduce my friend, Rob Junell, whose been nominated to serve as a district judge for the \nWestern District in Midland, Texas.  This court is identified as a judicial emergency by the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States.  Rob has brought his wife Beverly with him today and I know he will introduce her later. But, I \nwant to say that Rob and Beverly are real friends of mine. Sometimes we nominate people that are great on the \nmerits, but we don't know them.  Well, Rob is great on the merits and I know him well.\n\nHe served seven terms in the Texas House of Representatives, retiring voluntarily last year.  He was Chairman of \nthe House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee.  And, I worked with him when I was state \ntreasurer and just a little (inaudible) about the kind of person he is. I was elected to a four- year term as state \ntreasurer and introduced a very complicated piece of legislation to limit our state debt to the legislator, asked \nRepresentative Junell to carry that bill since he was Chairman of the Appropriations Committee.  And, I thought \nsince it was so complicated that I would put it out there, talk about it, let the members have a chance to really look \nat it and study it and then in my second year, second part of my term, after the fourth year, I thought we would try to \npass it.\n\nWell, Representative Junell did such a terrific job of carrying the bill, that he passed it the first session that I had \ngiven it to him.  And, we do have a limit now on general obligation debt in Texas, which has served us very well \nthroughout the ups and downs of the economy of our state.\n\nRob graduated from NMMI, then graduated from Texas Tech and Texas Tech Law School with honors.  He \nreceived a Masters Degree from the University of Arkansas.  He's very active in his local community of San Angelo, \nincluding service on the boards of the United Way of the Concho Valley, the San Angelo AIDS Foundation and \nShriner University in Coralville, Texas.  He's a lifetime member of the NAACP.  He also has received numerous \nhonors and awards recognizing his leadership in serving the people of Texas.\n\n\n\nHe's earned the distinction as legislator of the year, given by the Texas Public Employees Association, the Vietnam \nVeterans' Association, and the Greater Dallas Crime Commission.  The Dallas Morning News named him one of the \nbest of the best in the Texas legislature in 1995.\n\nIn addition to Rob's legislative service, he has continued to maintain a law practice.  In Texas, the legislature only \nmeets five months every other year, a practice that I would recommend to the United States Congress.  So, these \nare people who have real jobs in the real world.  He has been a practicing lawyer, very well respected in the San \nAngelo and West Texas communities and has a wide range of clients, including hospitals, small businesses, school \ndistricts and individuals.\n\nI recommend my friend, Rob Junell, highly to you and hope that we can have an expeditious confirmation of his \nnomination.\n\nHATCH: Senator, sorry you had to wait this long.  But, it's just the way it is on this committee.  So\u2026\n\nHUTCHISON: Thank you.\n\nHATCH: \u2026 we appreciate you, your patience.\n\nLEAHY: And, I appreciate you being here too.  You've mentioned him before the same (inaudible).  He should know \nthat even when he's not (inaudible) you've always said such nice things about him.  And, as the good Congressman \nStenholm called me too to say similar things. And, I do appreciate it.\n\nHUTCHISON: Yes.  Thank you very much.\n\nHATCH: We'll turn to Senator Voinovich first and then we'll wind up with Senator Dewine.\n\nVOINOVICH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nMembers of the committee, I thank you for allowing me to speak on behalf of three deserving attorneys from the \nState of Ohio.  I'm anxious to express my strong recommendations for Justice Deborah Cook, Jeffrey Sutton, both \nof whom the president nominated to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth District, as well as \nJudge John Adams whose been nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\n\nJudge Cook and Mr. Sutton were members of the original group that the President of the United States nominated \nfor the federal judiciary.  And, I'm very pleased that this committee is finally having a hearing on their nominations.\n\nI've known Judge Cook for over 25 years.  I know her to be a brilliant lawyer, a wonderful person.  She graduated \nfrom the University of Akron Law School in 1998, or '78, and immediately went to work for the law firm of Roderick, \nMyers and Linton, Akron's oldest law firm.  She was the first female lawyer to be hired by this firm. And in 1983 she \nbecame its first female partner.\n\nDeborah remained at Roderick, Myers until '91 when she was elected to Ohio's Ninth District Court of Appeals.  She \nremained on this bench until '95 when she was elected to the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio, an office which \nshe continues to hold.  She's married to her husband Robert Linton and Deborah has always exhibited a love of her \nfamily and community and I'm glad that her brother and her nephews are here today for this hearing.  It's a historic \nday for their family.\n\nAs a long-time resident of Akron, Deborah has demonstrated her commitment to her community, involved in the \nAkron Women's Network, the Akron Bar Association, the Akron Volunteer Center, Summit County United Way and \nthe Akron Art Museum, just to name a few.\n\nThroughout these 25 years I have found Deborah to be a women of exceptional character and integrity.  Her \nprofessional demeanor and thorough knowledge combine to make her truly an excellent candidate for appointment \nto the Sixth Circuit.\n\n\n\nDeborah has served with distinction on Ohio Supreme Court since her election in '94 and reelection in the year \n2000.  My only regret is the confirmation of the Sixth District that we will lose an outstanding judge in our Supreme \nCourt.  However, I'm confident that she will be a real asset to the federal bench.  With the combined years of 10 \nyears of appellate judicial experience on the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court, she uniquely combines \nkeen intellect, legal scholarship and consistency in her opinions.\n\nShe's a strong advocate of applying the law without fear or favor and not making policy towards a particular \nconstituency.  She is a committed individual and trusted leader and it's my pleasure to give her my highest \nrecommendation. I'd just like to mention in closing that newspapers from Ohio have endorsed her on two occasions.  \nAnd, recently on January 6, 2003, the Columbus Dispatch said since 1996 she has served on the Ohio Supreme \nCourt where she has distinguished herself as a careful jurist with a profound respect for judicial restraint and the \nseparation of powers between the three branches of government.  The Plain Dealer, the largest newspaper in Ohio \nsaid Cook is a thoughtful, mature jurist, perhaps the brightest on the state's highest court.\n\nAnd, in May of 2000 the Beacon Journal, the Akron paper, stated that Deborah Cook's work has been a careful \nreading of the law, buttress by closely argued opinions and sharp legal reasoning.\n\nI think that Deborah is someone that's very ideal for the federal bench.\n\nJeffrey Sutton, another nominee.  I'm pleased to speak on behalf of Jeffrey, a man of unquestioned intelligence and \nqualifications with vast experience in commercial, constitutional and appellate legislation litigation.\n\nJeffrey graduated first in his law school from the Ohio State University, followed by two clerkships with the United \nStates Supreme Court, as well as the Second Circuit.  Because he was the Solicitor General of Ohio when I was \ngovernor I worked with him extensively when he represented the governor's office.\n\nVOINOVICH: And, in my judgment, he never exhibited any predisposition with regard to an issue.  He has \ncontributed so much with his compassion for people and the law.  In my opinion, Jeffrey Sutton is exactly what the \nfederal bench needs, fresh, objective perspective.  He's fair and eminently qualified.\n\nHis qualifications for this judgeship are best evidenced through his experience.  He has argued nine cases before \nthe United States Supreme Court, including Hahn versus the United States, in which the court invited Mr. Sutton's \nparticipation; and Becker versus Montgomery, in which he represented prisoners' interests pro bono.  It is worthy to \nnote that when I recently visited the Supreme Court to move the admission of some of my fellow Ohio State \nUniversity graduates, that the Clerk of the Court himself commented favorably on Jeff's ability.  I'll never forget it.  \nWe were moving him through and went of the way.\n\nIn addition to the U.S. Supreme Court, Jeff has argued 12 cases in the Ohio Supreme Court and six in the Sixth \nCircuit.  While his unwillingness to shy away from challenging or controversial issues has in some instances led \ncritics to question his qualifications and accomplishments, I believe such comments don't accurately reflect Jeff \nSutton's heart.\n\nWhat these detractors fail to mention is how he argued pro bono on behalf of a blind student seeking admission to \nmedical school, how he filed an amicus curiae brief with the Ohio Supreme Court in support of Ohio's hate crimes \nlaw on behalf of the Anti-defamation League, NAACP and other human rights bar association, or his work on \nbehalf of the Equal Justice Foundation arguing on behalf of the poor.  You don't hear that much about Jeff.\n\nJeff Sutton is also should not be criticized on assumptions that past legal positions reflect his personal views.  \nInstead, he should be lauded for always zealously advocating his clients' interest matter what the issue.  In fact, the \nletters I received in support of Jeff's nomination are some of the best evidence of his overwhelming, across the \nboard support in the State of Ohio.  And, I'm going to ask that these letters that I've got be submitted for the record, \nMr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: We'll put them in the record.\n\n\n\nVOINOVICH: But, I'd like to just read an excerpt from Benson Wolman.  Benson Wolman and I have known each \nother since we were in law school together.  He was probably the most liberal member there at the Ohio State \nUniversity.  He's the former executive director of the ACLU of Ohio, a self-proclaimed liberal democrat.  And, here's \nwhat he said. \"Jeff's commitment to individual rights, his civility as an opposing council, his sense of fairness, his \ndevotion to civic responsibilities and his keen and demonstrated intellect all reflect the best that is to be found in the \nlegal profession.\n\nGreg Myers, chief counsel in the death penalty division of the Office of the Public Defender remarked, \"Jeff's \nintegrity, respect, tolerance and understanding, not only for the lawyers who advocate different positions, but for the \nlegal ideas that stand in opposition to his.\"\n\nMr. Chairman, I could go on praising Jeff for the outstanding -- he's one of the brightest -- he may be the brightest \nlawyer we got in the entire state.  I question his sense of wanting to serve on the federal bench at his young age \nwith a family that he has.  But, you'll see from his testimony.  He's an unbelievably qualified individual that really \nwants to serve his country.  He's been active in his community.  I'm glad that his wife and his children are here \ntoday with him and members of his family.  And, I want to thank them for the sacrifice that they're willing to make to \nallow him to serve in the judiciary.\n\nSo, Mr. Chairman, I've worked with Deb and with Jeff and they're wonderful people and they'll be real assets to the \ncourt.\n\nAnd, the last individual, and I'll try to make it short, is John Adams.  John is a native of Orville, Ohio.  He's a very \nqualified candidate for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District. Judge Adams received his degrees from \nBowling Green, his Jurist Doctorate from the University of Akron.  He currently is a judge in the Court of Common \nPleas in Summit County, the Court of Common Pleas is the primary state court, having original jurisdiction in all \ncriminal felony cases and all civil cases where the amount in controversy is over 15,000.  And, prior to that, the \njudge worked as a partner in the law firm of Kaufmann and Kaufmann in Akron.  As a Summit County prosecutor, \nand as an associate with the law firm of German, Arandi and Cicilini (ph).\n\nJudge Adams has demonstrated a commitment to the community he lives in.  He's a member of the Akron Bar \nAssociation, Ohio Bar.  He received a volunteer award in 2000 for the dramatic brain injury collaborative.  He has \nmemberships in the Summit County Mental Health Association, the NAACP, Summit County Criminal Justice \nCoordinating Counsel, Summit County Civil Justice Commission.\n\nI sincerely hope that the committee acts favorably on Judge Adams nominations and sends this qualified nominee \nto the Senate floor as soon as possible.\n\nAnd, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to say one other thing.  I know there's been a lot of controversy about the sixth district \nand who did what and so on and so forth, whether it was during the Clinton Administration, now the Bush \nAdministration.  The Sixth District is in need of new, more judges.  They are in a crisis situation.  And I would ask \nthis committee to expeditiously move on those two nominees. And, you know, either they're up or down, but let's get \non with it. It's important.  We have -- I mean it's just unbelievable to me that this going on as long as it has.  And, I'm \nhopeful that maybe somehow all of you can work together to move forward to fill those two vacancies on that court.\n\nThank you very much for giving me a chance to be here.\n\nHATCH: Thank you, Senator.\n\nLEAHY: (Inaudible) it's been a long time and we want to fill them.  But, it would work a lot better if the White House \nconsulted with some of the Senators in the area involved, such as Senators Levin and Stabenow, who had \nnominated people for years.  They weren't even given a hearing.  There's a way to move things along.  But, it's not \nsimply saying, this is who we pick after we blocked everybody you wanted, now you must do those.  That's all I'd \nsay to my good friend, who I know is a very fair-minded person.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, let me just say this that the administration has consulted with the instate Senators from Ohio on this \nmatter, which is their obligation.  And, I expect them to consult with the Senators from the other states when they \nhave nominees that are up from their states.  And, I demanded that they do.  And, I believe they are doing that.  \nNow, I think they've met the requisite consultation here without question, and both Senators are for all three of \nthese Ohio nominees.\n\nBut, your statement, Senator, it's high praised indeed.  With the experience that you've had in the State of Ohio, I \nthink you've made a terrific statement for these nominees from Ohio and I commend you for it and sorry you had to \nwait so long.  But, we're grateful to have had you here.\n\nNow, let me just say this -- yes, go ahead, Senator.\n\nLEAHY: I think it's fair to say that the two Senators from Ohio, I think it's fair to say the two Senators from Ohio are \nwell liked by everybody on this committee on both sides of the aisle.  I certainly appreciated serving with them.  I \nwas struck, though, by something that Senator Voinovich said about the delays in getting vacancies filled in the \nSixth Circuit.\n\nI wished that, frankly, George, I wish there'd been more in your party who had expressed the same concern when \nthere was several moderate nominees, including one from your own state as strongly supported in your state.  \nDuring the Clinton Administration there's been more effort to get them to at least have a hearing so that they might \nhave been put on there.\n\nI contrast that with when I became chairman we moved two people to the Sixth Circuit within a relatively short time \nfrom the time of their hearing to the time they were going on the floor was a matter of weeks at best, and I think that \nyou would not see the vacancies had there been more of a bipartisan effort to get those nominees of President \nClinton's, to get them through rather than to be held up by a republican holds.\n\nHATCH: Senator Feinstein has asked to be able to go now.  And, then I'm going to give Senator Dewine -- we \nunderstand the room that's available downstairs prepared.  So, Senator Dewine if you'd prefer to go here or down \nthere, we'll give you that choice.\n\nDEWINE: It doesn't matter, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Well, then we'll wait\u2026\n\nVOINOVICH: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Thank you, Senator Voinovich. Then, if you don't mind\u2026\n\nDEWINE: No, (inaudible).\n\nHATCH: \u2026 we'll wait until we get down there and then you can finish your statement.\n\nAnd, Senator Feinstein, if you'd care to make yours now, I'd be happy to accommodate you.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I'm very pleased to introduce Judge James Otero to the \ncommittee.  He's nominated for the Central District of California.  He is the sixth candidate to come before this \ncommittee as a product of California's bipartisan screening committee, which the White House, Senator Boxer and I \nhave set up.  He received the unanimous six zero vote from this screening committee.\n\nHe is joined at the hearing today by his wife, Jill, his son, Evan, and his daughter Lauren.  Jill is a special education \nteacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  She's been that for 28 years.  Evan is a junior at my alma mater, \nStanford, where he's majoring in Political Science; and, Lauren, a high school senior just got accepted to Stanford \nUniversity.  I'd like to ask them to stand and be acknowledged by the committee.\n\nThank you very much for being here.\n\n\n\nJudge Otero is a native Californian.  He spent his entire legal career in the state.  He graduated from California \nState University North Ridge in 1973 and Stanford Law School in 1976.  Immediately out of law school he joined \nthe Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.  He practiced there for 10 years.\n\nHe held a number of important assignments, including assistant supervisor for the city's criminal division where he \nwas in charge of 35 trial deputies.  In '87 he entered private practice as a lawyer for Southern Pacific Transportation \nCompany.  His time in private practice was brief as he was appointed to the municipal court of Los Angeles in 1988.  \nTwo years later he was elevated to the Supreme Court.\n\nHis 13-year career on the state bench has been distinguished. Notably, from '94 to '96 he served as the supervising \njudge of the Northern District in Los Angeles.  In 2002 he was named Assistant Supervising Judge for the court's \ncivil division.  And, he's earned a reputation as one of the top judges in Los Angeles City.\n\nI can give you many quotes from Judge Gregory O'Brien, Attorney Tom Girardi (ph), Los Angeles Supreme Court \njudge, Chris Conway (ph), whose described him as one of the best judges on the court.\n\nHe's active in professional and civic activities.  He's secretary of California Latino Judges' Association and \npreviously served as vice president of the California Judges' Association.  He's a board member of the Salesian \nBoys and Girls Club and the Salesian Family Youth Center.\n\nI could also note he's a fitness buff and over the past years he's run in over 100 races, included 10 marathon.  I \nthink it's fair to say that I strongly recommend Judge Otero.\n\nAnd, I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you, Senator Feinstein.\n\nNow, here's what we're going to do.  We're going to move down to STG50.  We would like all of you in this room, \nwe're trying to accommodate you by having the Sergeant of Arms and his people accompany you downstairs so \nthat you can get seated down there.  So, we would like you, row by row, after the dais is cleared, to come through \nthis door, just come up through there, through that door. And, we'll try and get this started.  We're going to recess \nfor 10 minutes and hope we can set up in that time down there.\n\n(RECESS)\n\n(AUDIO GAP DUE TO ROOM CHANGE)\n\nDEWINE: \u2026 Justice Cook in all five of those cases.  Let me repeat that, the United States Supreme Court has \nagreed with Justice Cook in all five of those cases.  Of those cases, one of those cases was simply unanimous \nOhio Supreme Court decision affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court eight to one.  But, in the other four (inaudible) \nCook had dissented in the underlying Ohio case. She was the dissenter.  In each of these four cases, the U.S. \nSupreme Court reversed, reversed Ohio Supreme Court's majority opinion and reached the same conclusion, the \nsame conclusion as Justice Cook did.\n\nNow, these were not all just a close five to four decision that we sometimes see in the U.S. Supreme Court.  In a \nFifth Amendment self-incrimiation case, the Supreme Court sides with Justice Cook nine to nothing.  Another case \nwent eight to one against siding with Justice Cook's dissent.  So, it's clear from these statistics that Justice Cook's \ndecision when we was dissenting in these cases was well founded.\n\nNow, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, another useful gage of a sitting judge is the evaluation she gets \nfrom the Deputy Observers who watch the court on a day-to-day basis.  In Ohio the major newspapers closely \nwatched our high court.\n\nAfter observing Justice Cook on the Ohio Supreme Court for a full six-year term, Justice Cook was endorsed by all \nthe major newspapers in the state of Ohio for her 2000 reelection campaign.  These newspapers included the \n\n\n\nCleveland Plain Dealer, the Columbus Dispatch, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Akron Beacon Journal, the Dayton \nDaily News and the Toledo Blade.\n\nAnd, let me just say, someone who has a lot of experience with these newspapers, that covers the entire political \nspectrum in the State of Ohio.  Since the election in the past few weeks, several Ohio papers have endorsed her \nnomination to the Sixth Circuit.\n\nThe Cincinnati Post wrote on January 8 of this year, and I quote, Mr. Chairman, \"Cook is serving her second term \non the Ohio Supreme Court where she has been a pillar of stability and good sense.  Her role on that court, one \nwhich in the last few years has repeatedly marched on four to three votes into the realm of policymaking, has often \nbeen writing sensible dissents.\"\n\nOn December 29, 2002, insisting that the Judiciary Committee act on Justice Cook, the Cleveland Plain Dealer \nwrote, and I quote, \"Cook is a thoughtful mature jurist, perhaps the brightest on the state's highest court.\" The \nAkron Beacon Journal wrote on January 6, 2003, and I quote, \"Those who watched the Ohio Court know Cook is no \nideologue.  She has been a voice of restraint in opposition to a court majority determined to chart and aggressive \ncourse, acting as problem solvers more than jurists.  In Deborah Cook, they have a judge most deserving of \nconfirmation, one dedicated to judicial restraint.\"\n\nAnd, the Columbus Dispatch wrote on January 6, 2003, and I quote, \"Cook's record is one of continuing \nachievement.  Since 1996, she has served on the Ohio Supreme Court where she has distinguished herself as a \ncareful jurist with a profound respect for judicial restraint and the separation of powers between the three branches \nof government.\"\n\nNow, Mr. Chairman, these quotes are from papers across the political spectrum, all of which endorse Justice Cook.  \nAs these comments make clear, Justice Cook is a talented, serious judge who works diligently to follow the law.  \nAnd, at the same time she also dedicates, though, a great deal of her time to volunteer work and community \nservice.  Justice Cook has served on the United Way Board of Trustees, the Volunteer Center Board of Trustees, \nthe Akron School of Law Board of Trustees and the Women's Network Board of Directors.  She was named \nWoman of the Year in the 1991, by the Women's Network.  She has volunteered for the safe landing shelter and for \nmobile meals. And, she has served as a board member and then president of the Akron Volunteer Center.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Chairman, Justice Cook has served as a commission on the Ohio Commission for Dispute \nResolution and Conflict Management, where she focused on, among other things, truancy, mediation for \ndisadvantaged students.  She has chaired Ohio's commission on public legal education and has taught continuing \nlegal education seminars on oral argument and brief writing.\n\nI find it, Mr. Chairman, remarkable that Justice Cook has found time for this level of commitment to her community. \nAnd, I have yet to describe the most amazing to me, commitment Justice Cook has made helping the \nunderprivileged in Ohio.  Like many of us, Justice Cook believes that the ticket out of poverty is a quality education.  \nAnd, over the years, Justice Cook and her husband, in their everyday lives have come across hard working young \npeople who are making an effort to improve their lives through education.  Tasha (ph) Smith is one of those people.  \nJustice Cook met her when she was struggling to put herself through college at Kent State by working as a \nwaitress. Justice Cook assisted her with tuition for several years.  And, today this woman is in her final year of \nnursing school carrying a 3.8 grade point average.\n\nTara King is another of these students.  With Justice Cook's help she recently graduated from the University of \nAkron and she just enrolled in graduate school at Cleveland State.  After helping several students in this manner, \nJustice Cook and her husband decided they should structure their assistance so they could help more young \npeople early on in their education.\n\nFour years ago they started the College Scholars Program with a group of 20 disadvantaged third graders from an \ninner-city school. The students were selected to participate based on teacher recommendations, financial need, and \nlevel of family support.  Justice Cook matched each of the students with a mentor in the community.  The students \nmet with their mentors weekly and participated in other program activities.  If the student maintained good grades \n\n\n\nand conduct through secondary school, Justice Cook and her husband will pay for four years of their tuition in any \npublic university in Ohio.  Let me repeat that, Justice Cook is going to pay for four years of college tuition for 20, 20 \ndisadvantaged children.\n\nNow, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee, these activities demonstrate a commitment to the community \nand dedication to helping the disadvantaged that we would like to see in everyone. And these are qualities that help \nmake Justice Deborah Cook a fine judge.\n\nNow, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee, let me turn my attention to another one of our fine nominees \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Jeff Sutton.  Mr. Sutton, who is from Columbus is here today with his family.  And I'd like to introduce \nthe committee to his wife, Peggy, and their three children, Margaret, who is six years old; John, who is nine years \nold; and Nathaniel, who just today is turning 11.\n\nHappy birthday, Nathaniel.\n\nI'd like also to welcome Jeff's parents, Nancy and David Sutton, his sister, Amy; his brothers Craig and Matt and \nseveral additional friends and family.  We're very pleased that all of you could be here on this very important day.\n\nMr. Chairman, Mr. Sutton's legal and life experiences are extensive.  A couple of years ago, before high school, his \nfather took over -- a couple of years before high school his father took over a boarding school for children with \nsevere cerebral palsy.  Over six years, Mr. Sutton spent much of his time around the school, doing odd jobs for this \nfather.  He was deeply affected by this experience and by the interactions that he had with these students during his \nformative years.  It reinforced what he had been taught by his parents, that serving others is an important calling \nand virtue.\n\nMr. Sutton attended Williams College where he was a laymen scholar and varsity soccer player.  He graduated with \nhonors in history.  And, after college from 1985 to 1987, Mr. Sutton was a seventh grade geography teacher and \ntenth grade history teacher, as well as a high school varsity soccer coach and the middle school baseball coach.\n\nFrom there he went on to law school and graduated first in his class from the Ohio State University College of Law \nwhere he served as Issue Planning Editor of the Law Review.  Mr. Sutton clerked for Judge Thomas Meskill on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He clerked for two U.S. Supreme Court Justices, retired Justice \nPowell and Justice Scalia.\n\nIn 1995 to 1998, Mr. Sutton was the State Solicitor of Ohio, which is the state's top appellate lawyer.  During this \nservice, the National Association of Attorneys General presented him with the best brief award for practicing in the \nU.S. Supreme Court, a recognition he received an unprecedented four years in a row.\n\nMr. Sutton is currently a partner in the Columbus law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue.  He's a member of the \nColumbus Bar Association, the Ohio Bar Association and the American Bar Association.  He has also been adjunct \nprofessor of law at the Ohio State University College of Law since 1994, where he teaches seminars on federal and \nstate constitutional law.  And, recently, Mr. Chairman, the American Lawyer rated him one of its 45 under 45.  That \nis, they ranked, named him as one of the top, one of the 45 top lawyers in the country under the age of 45.\n\nHe's appeared frequently in court, I think argued 12 cases before the United States' Supreme Court, where he has \na nine and two record, with one case still pending.  In the Supreme Court's 2000-2001 term, Mr. Sutton argued four \ncases, that's more cases than any other private practitioners in the entire country.\n\nCan we imagine preparing to argue one case before the Supreme Court, much less than four?  And, to no one's \nsurprise, Jeff Sutton won all four.\n\nMr. Sutton also has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, six cases before various U.S. Courts of Appeals \nand numerous cases before the State and federal trail courts.\n\nAnd, over the years Mr. Sutton has been the lawyer for a range of clients on a wide range of issues.  Some of these \ncases are quite well known.  For example, he represented the State of Ohio on Flores versus the City of Boerne, \n\n\n\nthe State of Florida in Kimel versus Florida Board of Regents; and the State of Alabama in the University of \nAlabama versus Garrett.  But, Mr. Chairman, I would like to tell the committee about some less well-known cases.\n\nHe represented as my colleague, Senator Voinovich has indicated, Cheryl Fischer, a blind women who was denied \nadmission to a state-run medical school in Ohio because of her disability.  He represented the National Coalition of \nStudents with Disabilities in a lawsuit alleging Ohio universities were violating the federal motor voter law by failing \nto provide their disabled students with voter registration materials.\n\nHe filed an amicus brief in the Ohio Supreme Court defending, defending Ohio's hate crimes statute.  And he filed it \non behalf of the NAACP, the Anti-defamation League and other civil rights groups.\n\nHe defended Ohio's minority set-aside statute against constitutional attack.  He filed an amicus brief in the Sixth \nCircuit on behalf of the Center for the Prevention of Handgun Violence, defending, defending an assault weapon \nordinance.  He represented two capital inmates in state and federal court.  And he represented an inmate who \nbrought a prisoners' rights lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Chairman, I'm sure we'll have the opportunity to go through these cases in some detail and many other cases, \nbut I'm confident the committee will be impressed by Mr. Sutton's ability in representing these various clients in \nthese cases.\n\nLike Justice Cook, and consistent with his upbringing, Mr. Sutton has found an extraordinary amount of time to give \nback to his community.  Between a demanding law practice and time with his very young family, he serves on the \nBoard of Trustees of the Equal Justice Foundation, a non-profit provider of legal services to disadvantaged \nindividuals and groups, including the disabled.  He has spent considerable time doing pro bono legal work, \naveraging between 100 and 200 hours per year.\n\nDEWINE: He is an elder and deacon in the Presbyterian Church, as well as a Sunday school teacher.  He \nparticipates in numerous other community activities, including, I Know I Can, which provides college scholarships to \ninner-city children and Pro musica (ph), the chamber of music organization.  He also coaches soccer and basketball \nteams.\n\nFinally, Mr. Chairman, I was struck by something I once read that Mr. Sutton wrote in the Columbus Dispatch about \nformer Supreme Court Justice Powell.  In describing Justice Powell's practical voice in the court, he wrote the \nfollowing, and I quote, \"Justice Powell never lost sight of the context in which each decision was made and the \npeople, the people that it would affect.  He believed in people more than ideas and experience, and experience \nmore than ideology, and in the end embraced a judicial pragmatism that served the country well.\"\n\nMr. Chairman, I believe the same description applies to Mr. Sutton.  He will approach the bench in the same \npragmatic tempered and very thoughtful well.  I appreciate the chairman's time and I yield the floor.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you, thank you, Senator.\n\nWe'll call the three nominees, the Honorable Deborah Cook, Mr. John Roberts and Professor Jeffrey Sutton to the \nwitness table, and, if you'll stand and raise your right hand.  Do you solemnly agree to tell the truth, the whole truth \nand nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n\nWe'll start with you, Justice Cook, and if you have any opening statements we'd like you introduce your families \nagain, and those who are with you.  And we're just delighted to have you here and we look forward to completing \nthis hearing.\n\nCOOK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nMy family has been introduced, but I would like to introduce one additional friend who has appeared today with me \nand it's Mr. Robin Weaver (ph).  Robin is a partner with the international firm of Squires, Sanders and Dempees \n(ph) in the home office in Cleveland. And Robin also serves as the president of the Cleveland Bar Association.  And \nhe was kind enough to come today and I wish to thank him and introduce him.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Delighted to have you here, Mr. Weaver.  I've heard of you and we're very privileged to have you in our \naudience today.\n\nCOOK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Do you care to make an opening statement?\n\nCOOK: I thought I -- I won't reintroduce my family.  They\u2026\n\nHATCH: (Inaudible).\n\nCOOK: \u2026 were good enough to already stand\u2026\n\nHATCH: But, if you have a statement?\n\nCOOK: I have no statement, thank you.\n\nHATCH: That'll be fine.\n\nMr. Roberts, we'll turn to you.\n\nROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to introduce my wife, Jane.\n\nHATCH: Nice to meet you (inaudible).\n\nROBERTS: The committee has already heard some unscheduled testimony from my children, Josephine and Jack. \nAnd, I thank the committee for its indulgence.  I thought it was important for them to be here.  Also here are my \nparents, Jack, Senior and Rosemary Roberts.\n\nHATCH: We're delighted to have you here.\n\nROBERTS: My three sisters, Kathy Godby (ph), Peggy Roberts and Barbara Burke (ph); my brothers in law, Tim \nBurke (ph), and Gus Godby (ph) and my niece Katie Godby (ph), and many other friends that I'm very happy to \nhave here today.\n\nHATCH: We're delighted to have all of you here.  And we look forward to this hearing, and I hope you do to.\n\nMr. Sutton?\n\nSUTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My family, I guess they could stand up again.  I think most of them have been \nintroduced.  But there are a few that did not get mentioned.  My brother in law, Bill Sutherd (ph), has come down \nfrom Boston; another brother in law, Jim Sutherd (ph), from Ohio, and Jim's two kids, Emily and Tyler have joined \nus as well.  And, my sister Amy's boyfriend, Chris Sterndale (ph) who's earning a lot of praise from me, in Amy's\u2026\n\nHATCH: I didn't see Chris stand up here.  OK.  I see, OK.\n\nSUTTON: And, of course thank you very much for the opportunity to have this hearing today.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you so much.  We're delighted to have all of you here.  We welcome you to the committee.  \nWe're going to have 15- minute rounds.  We have our staffs that are sitting in the middle.  He is going to hold up \ncards that will have -- tell the times left.  What are the three cards?  That one -- the red is what?  That's out of time.  \nOK.  Orange is one minute.  OK. Well, he'll give you notice that the -- and when five minutes are remaining and \nthen one minute and then we're out of time.\n\nWe're going to cut off, but if a Senator feels that they just have to pursue a line of questioning, we'll certainly \nconsider allowing that.  We'll turn to Senator -- I'll reserve my time and use it later.  And, we'll turn to Senator \nKennedy.  This time with the permission of the ranking member.\n\n\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Chairman, if I could also just ask that permission the number of letters referring to Professor Sutton, I \nknow you've introduced letters in favor of him and I've introduced this stack for the record\u2026\n\nHATCH: Without objection, we'll put them in the record.\n\nKENNEDY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I must say just before questioning our nominees here, and I want \nto congratulate all of them on receiving their nomination.  I'm troubled, like other members, of the committee of \nhaving three nominees who are controversial and having one hearing that is going to do this.  Out of necessity and \ndesire will attend a memorable service for the death of a former congressman from Utah this afternoon, which I had \nlong scheduled to be an hour and a half.  We generally allocate 9:30 in the morning and I'm glad to stay here what \nof the time.  But, I think there's -- this cramped process and procedure I think is unworthy, quite frankly, of the \ncommittee.\n\nThese are enormously important nominees.  These are incredibly important issues and it -- the scheduling of three \nnominees and others here suggests that policy to try and jam those that have serious questions.  And I resent it and \nI find that it's not a particularly good way to expect that we're going to have a wide to cooperation.  If we have to \nexercise all of our rights in order to protect them, then so be it.  And if that's the desire to do so, so be it as well.\n\nWe have three nominees here for the Circuit Court.  Mr. Sutton is the nominee for the Court Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, has actively sought to weaken Congress's ability to protect the civil rights and the ability of individuals to \nenforce their federal rights in court. His efforts to challenge and weaken the laws are central to our democracy and \nproviding equal opportunity are well-documented.\n\nHe has argued for the limitation on the reach of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the \nAge Discrimination Act and Employment Act, the Violence Against Women Act, the Medicaid Act, to name just a \nfew.\n\nA large number of national state and local disability rights groups, civil rights groups, women's groups, senior \ncitizen organization and others have raised serious questions about Mr. Sutton's nomination.\n\nJustice Deborah Cook, another nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals has a disturbing record and a bias in favor of \nbusiness and corporation over the interest of injured individuals, workers, consumers and women, numerous Ohio \ncitizens and groups to raise strong concerns about her nomination, including the Ohio National Organization of \nWomen, Ohioans with Disability.\n\nAnd, the nomination of John Roberts to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit raises concerns.  The D.C. \nCircuit, one of the most important courts in the country having jurisdiction over many workplace, environment, civil \nrights, consumer protection statutes, wiretap, other important security issues.  I am concerned about Mr. Roberts \nefforts to limit reproductive rights as a government lawyer, his advocacy against affirmative action and federal \nenvironment protection laws in his efforts to shields states from individual suits, and to limit Congress's ability to \npass legislation regulating state conduct in the name of the state's rights.  And, given the strong concerns raised by \neach of the nominees to pack them into a single hearing impairs our ability to fulfill, I think, our constitutional duty to \nrigorously review their records.  So, I will move towards questioning the nominees.  Mr. Sutton.\n\nI happen to be here, Professor Sutton, during the enactment of virtually all of these pieces of legislation, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.  I remember the hours of hearings, the length of the hearings, the work that was \ndone.  Senator Hatch may remember opposition at that time objected to our considering the Americans With \nDisability Act.  We had to meet after the sessions of the Senate well into the evening until it was actually filibustered \nto one or two in the morning.\n\nAnd, then we saw those in the disability community in wheelchairs come on into the hearing room, first of all, five, \n10, eventually about 100 or 150.  Suddenly televisions began to come into the committee room, more and more of \nthem.  And, then finally at 2:30, the individual, the Senator who was filibustering, no longer in the Senate at this \ntime, yielded and we were able to pass it.  We spend weeks and months in building a wreck (ph) because that -- the \nAmericans with Disability Act follows a very important movement in this country to knock down walls for \n\n\n\ndiscrimination, which you're very familiar with. In terms of knocking down the walls of discrimination on the basis of \nrace, religion, ethnicity, gender and then finally, the Americans with Disability Act, and we still have, I think, work to \ndo in terms of sexual orientation of the Americans with Disability Act.\n\nSo, this was something that those of us who had been a part of that whole movement were here at the time when \nwe made the progress in terms of knocking down the walls of discrimination on race, knocking down the walls of \ndiscrimination on gender, knocking down on the eliminating the discriminatory provisions of the Immigration Act, \nnation origin quotas in the Asia Pacific triangle saw this progress made.  And then we passed that Americans with \nDisability Act and we find that there is -- and when we passed it and said we wanted it to apply to all Americans, we \nmeant all Americans.  But, we find that the Supreme Court said that the we, under arguments that you made, may \nvery effectively, does not apply to the state employees.  And it means that state employees cannot get protection, of \nthat.\n\nWe also had the age discrimination, age discrimination and we find out under your arguments on the reaches of the \nconstitution that we cannot apply that to state employees.  The Title VI in the (inaudible) impact regulations can't be \nprivately enforced in positions that you presented to the court supported.\n\nThose that find out that there are sightings of toxic dumps in minority communities that are resulting in the poor \nchildren suffering and contacting asthma, other cancer, but the fact that it is being used in a discriminatory way, \nsomething that we take very seriously as legislators now.  With understanding your position in terms of the \nConstitution, that's no longer -- those kinds of remedies aren't going to be able to be out there.  Title Nine \nregulations, now I remember the battle that we had.  Going back, we heard the eloquent statement not long ago \nwhen Senator Bayh the current Senator Bayh's father spoke about the work that was being done on the Title Nine \nand we find out that it cannot be privately enforced because the Sandoval decision.\n\nAnd the Religious Restoration Act that the chairman has referenced and that we had, all extremely important kinds \nof progress over the period of these past years.  Now, you have supported a viewpoint that has effectively \ndismantled many of these protections. And, it is one that's been embraced in some instances by five four decisions \nof these courts, virtually divided by the Supreme Court in terms of these protections, which effect millions of fellow \ncitizens, those that have been left out and left behind, those that are getting the short stick in our society.  I'm \nimpressed, deeply impressed by your own personal kinds of involvement reaching out with the works that you've \ndone privately.\n\nBut, there is very legitimate kind of questions about your being on the courts and whether you are going to take this \nposition with you in terms of continuing the dismantlement of the works of the Congress, and the remedies, the \nremedies, we'll come to that in just a moment, which you have also questioned.\n\nKENNEDY: The ability for private citizens to actually provide remedies for these statutes, which I think for many of \nus who have seen the efforts and the progress in civil rights cases just assume, but you challenged this, \nparticularly go out of your way in terms of amicus brief, go out of your way.\n\nIt says that we'll hear a list of these, this is very constitutionally, should we try (inaudible).  But, you go out of your \nway in the amicus brief in the Westside issue to try and diminish (inaudible).\n\nI'm interested just about how you came to this position and your own kind of experience and your views on it.  What \nyou can tell us about where you think, as a judge bring, what -- and what you would say to so many of those people \nthat are left out and behind that your presence on the court is not going to endanger, further, their rights that have \nbeen passed by Congress.\n\nSUTTON: Thank you, Senator Kennedy, for an opportunity to address those is issues and to discuss them with you \nand other members of the committee.  I do appreciate this opportunity, and am admirer of your work in all of those \nareas, and I hope there's nothing on top my career that makes you think otherwise.\n\nI guess I have a few thoughts and I hope I can answer this question and maybe I'll be able to explore this with some \nother questions as well.  But, I guess the first point I would make is that in all of the cases you referenced I was, of \n\n\n\ncourse, and advocate, not a sitting judge and not a scholar, and I'm flattered that someone has put professor in \nfront of this.  The people at Ohio State University will be amused by that designation.  But, I'm an advocate and I \nhave been since graduating from Ohio State in 1990 and since finishing my two clerkships.\n\nAnd, while I do understand, in all of these areas, and certainly in the disability rights area, concern that an \nadvocate would be willing to represent a state making the arguments in Garrett.  At the same time, I would hope \npeople would appreciate that the clients I have had and the cases I have worked on, whether for parties, for amicus \nentities or on a pro bono bases have covered the spectrum of issues really almost every social issue of the day and \nI have had an opportunity to be on opposite sides of almost every one of these issues.\n\nIf one talks about the issue of disability rights, I've had more cases on the side in which I was represented a \ndisabled individual than the opposite.  In fact, there's only one case that I can think of in my career where I had two \nclients come to me at the same time and say you can represent either side of this particular case.  That, of course, \nwas the Cheryl Fischer case, which arose when I was State Solicitor of Ohio in the mid-1990s.\n\nMs. Fischer, as you may know, is blind and was denied admission to Case Westerns Medical School on account of \nher blindness.  The Ohio Civil Rights Commission issued an order saying that that violated state civil rights laws, \nwhich incidentally went even further than the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  When that case came \nto the Ohio Supreme Court there was the Ohio Civil Rights Commissioner order to defend on the one hand, and on \nthe other hand the state universities of Ohio thought that Case Western was correct, that this had not been a \ndiscrimination.\n\nIt was then my job to go to the Attorney General and explain to her that in a somewhat unusual situation she needs \nto appoint lawyers on both sides of this difficult issue.  It fell to me to make a recommendation to the Attorney \nGeneral what should be done.  I thought that the State Solicitor of Ohio, the position I held, should argue Cheryl \nFischer's case.  I agreed with her position in the trial court, I thought it was the better of the positions.\n\nAnd, I recommended to the Attorney General that I argue that side of the case.  She agreed.  She appointed \nsomeone else to argue the other side of the case.  We established an ethical wall.  And, I think, while I certainly \nunderstand people who are interested in these important nominations looking at briefs and oral arguments I made \nin Garrett, I would hope that they would take the same time to read the briefs that I wrote in the Cheryl Fischer \ncase.\n\nMy opening brief and my reply brief and the oral argument I made there.  I'd be stunned if anyone read those briefs \nand thought there was any risk whatsoever of hostility to disability rights.  I think if anything the concern would be \njust the opposite.\n\nI've had an opportunity to represent other individuals with disabilities, most recently in federal court, I'm sorry, I \ndon't\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: No, no, I'm just watching that clock.  I don't want to interrupt you, but I did -- there are -- I want to let you \ncomplete, but I do want to get to, in this round, get to one other area, if I\u2026\n\nSUTTON: Well, I'll be brief.  Just on the advocacy point, I've represented several other clients with disabilities.  And \nall of those cases, as the ABA rules made clear, the client's position can't be ascribed to the lawyer.  And that's \nquite dangerous.  And, in fact, my risk in this hearing is not the failure to win a vote of the Democrat, I may lose \neverybody if one looks at all of my representations. Chairman Hatch said, unfortunately, that I never represented \nmurders. Well, it turns out I have.  I've represented two. And, I don't stand a chance in trying to become a judge if \none looks at all of my clients and decides whether they agreed with their views.\n\nI was not working at the university of Alabama when they formulated their policy.  I didn't work on the case in the \nlower courts.  That position had been formulated by the time it got to the U.S. Supreme Court.  I'm sorry.\n\nHATCH: I just -- Senator, but I'm going to give you additional time, because I know\u2026\n\n\n\nKENNEDY: Just on this, the fact it is, it isn't just in the cases themselves, Professor Sutton.  You have in your \nwritings and your speeches, in your talks, you've been very eloquent and have been very -- continue to be very \nsupportive of this concept.  I think we ought to disabuse ourselves that this isn't something that is just your \nrepresenting a client, because I have the examples in your statements and your writings and the speeches, where \nthere's positions where you took in there are -- anyone, I think, fair-minded person would read those would find that \nthey're deeply held.\n\nLet me go just to one other area and that is the limitations that you put in terms of the individual remedies.  We all \nunderstand a right without a remedy is not a right at all. You, in Westside filed the friend of the court, you didn't \nhave to do that. There's no obligation.  This was not applied.  You went about filing an amicus brief because you \nwanted to, felt compelled to.  And, in that brief, if your position had been sustained, would have effectively \noverturned 65 years of federal court jurisprudence in terms of the Medicaid spending clause into the Medicaid Act.\n\nAnd, effectively, it would have, in those cases, would have closed down the courthouse doors to the working \nparents in North Carolina who drove three and a half hours each way to get dental care for their children because \nthey could not find a dentist closer to home who would accept Medicaid, even though the Medicaid Act requires \nstates to ensure adequate supply of providers, or children with mental retardation and development disability in \nWest Virginia who face institutionalization because they could not get Medicaid to pay for home-based services \nthey need, even though the Medicaid Act requires the states to cover the services, or families in Arizona who are \nnot receiving notices of impartial hearings when their Medicaid HMO's denied or delayed needed treatments, even \nthough the Medicaid Act requires states to provide those rights to such persons.\n\nYou went into the court effectively to have them overturn 65 years of rights of individuals to pursue and to try and \nget a remedy. What do you think the -- those, again, that are the least able to protect themselves when you're on \nthe court, you're on the court and look at you.\n\nHow do you think they're going to view your views about their rights and being able to ensure that they're going to \nbe able to get remedies which have been, in legislation passed by the Congress, intended to be and passed by the \nCongress, and with your own, I suppose, knowledge, that the efforts to reduce the enforcement of those is quite \ncommon knowledge in terms of where the Congress is at the present time in terms of enforcement of these \nventures?\n\nI thank the chair for the additional time.\n\nSUTTON: Thank you, Senator Kennedy.  I think the case you're referring to is the Westside Mother's case, a \nDistrict Court case in Michigan.  And, I respectfully disagree with one component of your question, and that's the \nindication that I volunteered to take that case, so I wrote the briefs on my own behalf and that those -- that brief \nreflected my views.  That is not the case.\n\nAs has happened to me before in my career I was lucky enough to have the U.S. Supreme Court want to invite me \nto brief an issue that the advocates had not briefed or that one advocate is not willing to brief.  They asked me to \nbrief it, and I -- you know, it's not a call you\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: This was an amicus brief?\n\nSUTTON: Yes.  It's not a call you choose not to return. Exactly.  That's the Howen (ph) case where I wrote an \namicus brief for the O Supreme Court.  In the\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: Who asked -- excuse me, who asked you to file this?\n\nSUTTON: In the Howen (ph) case it was\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: No, in the Westside.\n\nSUTTON: The judge, Judge Cleland. His clerk called me, asked me to -- said he had briefing on what he perceived \nto be a very difficult issue and I think the way it was ultimately turned out in the case, two competing lines of U.S. \n\n\n\nSupreme Court authority, it wasn't this -- unlike the Howen (ph) case, this brief was not on behalf of myself. The \nMichigan Municipal League ultimately asked me to write the brief.\n\nSo, there was a client in the case.  And, I did exactly what I did in the Howen (ph) case when the U.S. Supreme \nCourt called me, which is brief the issue that I was asked to brief.  And, I want -- it's very important to me to explain \nthat, I mean, I was doing everything I could to advocate that particular position.  I could not fairly have said to the \ncourt, yes, I'll brief that argument and then pulled my punches and not explained every conceivable argument that \ncould have been raised on that side of the case.  I, of course, was not involved in the case for Michigan.\n\nI would point out as well in hearing criticisms about that particular decisions.  Well, I'm not going to criticize Judge \nCleland's decision.  The one thing I would ask you to look at if you're concerned about the case, is to please \ncompare the brief we wrote and the decision.  Many of the positions he took in that case were not positions we had \nadvocated.  So, I feel that that is not been accurate in the sense that it was something I\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: Yes, but the only point, and I know the time is going on, is that you argued.  It's not that they didn't \naccept it, because it would have basically overturned, I believe, a fair reading the existing law in terms of the rights \nof individuals to be able to seek remedies.  The only point, and this is my last one, is just how can we be sure that \nyou're not going to continue this agenda should you get on the court?  If you could just give us a brief comment on \nthat.\n\nSUTTON: Well, and I really hope I can do my best to give you that assurance.  Again, I would point out, I never \nheard of this case until I got a call from a federal district court judge asking me to brief that side of it.  There was \nnothing willful about that case and my involvement in it.  I was an invited by an Article Three judge to do it and I did \nit just as I did when the U.S. Supreme Court invited me.\n\nThe second thing is if one is concerned about some of these issues in general or civil rights and more particularly I \nwould hope that the members of the committee would not just consider the cases and the issues in the cases, but \nlook at the briefs I worked on and wrote, any of the cases that\n\nI'm sure you would be quite supportive of, whether it was defending Ohio's set aside statute in two different cases, \nwhether it was defending Ohio's hate crimes statute on behalf of virtually every civil rights group in the state that \nsupports that form of legislation, whether it was writing an amicus brief voluntarily in the Sixth Circuit on behalf of \nthe Center for the Prevention of Handgun Violence, whether it was seeking out a prisoner's civil rights case in the \nU.S. Supreme Court, where, again, one cannot criticize that as state's rights.  I was representing Dale Becker (ph), \nincarcerated in Chillicothe, Ohio against my former boss, the Attorney General Betty Montgomery.  So, I do \nunderstand your questions and I think they're very important, but I hope people will -- and I think this is why the \npublic wouldn't be concerned about my being a judge.  If I looked at these other representations where I was acting \nas an activist.\n\nKENNEDY: I thank the chair for extending\u2026\n\nHATCH: Thank you, Senator Kennedy.\n\nLet me ask a couple questions for you.  You've argued three very important controversial cases, among others, in \nfront of the U.S. Supreme Court concerning the scope of Congress's power under Section Five of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to regulate state governments.  Some of your critics suggest that your involvement in those cases \nshould someone disqualify from this position on the bench.  So, just let me ask you a few questions about those \ncases.\n\nAnd, I'm sure you know that I worked very hard, along with Senator Kennedy and others, to enact some of the laws \nthat you argued against.  We wrote the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. We brought together almost everybody \nin congress on that bill, which was struck down in the City of Burney case.  And, of course, I was one of the \nprinciple sponsors, as was Senator Kennedy, of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was limited in scope by \nthe University of Alabama versus Garrett.\n\n\n\nI also worked closely with Senator Biden, it was the Biden Hatch bill, on another law that the Supreme Court has \nfound to be beyond federal power, in part at least, and that's the Violence Against Women Act.  It was not easy for \nme, as well as my other people who worked -- with whom I worked, and who worked with me, to see these struck \ndown after we'd put so much time and energy into their enactment.\n\nHATCH: Of course, I understand the powerful constitutional principles underpinning the Supreme Court's decisions \nin those cases. But, I can also sympathize with those who might see things differently.  Regardless of my views \nabout these Supreme Court decisions, I certainly do not believe that your acting as a lawyer for your clients in those \ncases by itself should be any means, disqualify you from the bench.\n\nSo, what we need to know is whether you understand the difference between efficacy and judicial decision making, \nand whether you are firmly committed to the highest standards and principles of judicial restraint.\n\nSUTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for an opportunity to discuss those cases.  I guess the first point I would make \nin response to that concern is there's nothing about the issues in those cases or what happened in those cases that \nwould have precluded me from happily representing the other side in any of them.  And, as a Court of Appeals \njudge I have no idea what I do with those difficult issues except to say follow whatever U.S. Supreme Court \nprecedent was at the time.\n\nThe other point I would make is in 1995 when I became State Solicitor of Ohio, I couldn't even have given the \ndefinition of federalism, much less a definition before this body.  It wasn't something I had any involvement with.  It's \nnot something I'd studied in law school.  And, as State Solicitor of Ohio, though, I suddenly found myself for three \nand a half years with the responsibility of representing the state's interest.  Sometimes in cases like the Cheryl \nFischer case, sometimes in the set aside cases.  But, also in the City of Boerne case, which arose while I was state \nsolicitor.  And, the Attorney General of Ohio made the decision that the state was going to challenge RFRA.  It was \nnot a decision I was involved in.  That was a challenge that started at the district court level.  I didn't involved in that \nissue until it got to the U.S. Supreme Court.  And, at point in time, Steve said it would be appropriate to have an \namicus brief on behalf of many states explaining the states' perspective on these difficult issues, and that's what we \ndid.\n\nAnd, I do think the argument we made, while there's plenty of reason to disagree with the decision, reasonable \nminds can disagree about these issues.  The fact is the matter is not one justice of all nine members of this court \ndisagreed with the position advocated in the City of Boerne that ultimately the court has the final decision about the \nConstitution means.  In Kimel, that's the ADEA case that Senator Kennedy mentioned, the same is true. Not one \nmember of the court disagreed with the position we advocated.  Four members of the court disagreed with the \nSeminole Tribe (ph) decision, but no one disagreed with what we argued in our brief in terms of what Section 5 of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment means.\n\nAnd, in the Garrett case, yes there was disagreement.  The disagreement was five, four and the disagreement there \nwas about your record and whether it sufficed.  And, I can certainly understand how different people take it different \nviews on the deference that should be given to the record, the extensive and exhaustive record that you compiled.  \nBut, it wasn't my job to decide that case, it was my job as a lawyer to represent the state and do my best to \nadvocate deposition. And, that's what I tried to do.\n\nHATCH: Well, and I agree with that.  I think that's the point. Do you commit the deciding cases on the basis of \nrelevant statutes and binding precedence and the Constitution rather than relying on any preconceptions on policy \nopinions that you might hold personally?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely.\n\nHATCH: All right. Now, some people think this is not so much of the adhering to your own clients as to whether \nyou're arguments for those clients are within the mainstream of American legal fud (ph). So, if you don't mind I'm \ngoing to just go over those cases again so everybody here understands.\n\n\n\nIn the City of Boerne versus Flores (ph) it was a six to three decision dealing with the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, something that a number of us on this committee feel very deeply about.  And, let me just ask it \nagain.  How many justices on the Supreme Court disagreed with the position you advocated in that case?\n\nSUTTON: None. The only\u2026\n\nHATCH: Not one.\n\nSUTTON: \u2026 disagreement was about a prior decision\u2026\n\nHATCH: Right.\n\nSUTTON: \u2026 in the court called Smith, which is not something\u2026\n\nHATCH: And, you mentioned the Kimel versus Florida Board of Regents case.  How many justices on the Supreme \nCourt disagreed with the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that you advanced in that case?\n\nSUTTON: None.\n\nHATCH: Not one.  All of the justices agreed with you.\n\nSUTTON: I should make the point that the four dissenters disagreed with Seminole Tribe (ph), a prior decision\u2026\n\nHATCH: And you've made that point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSUTTON: \u2026 which we did not brief and I did not -- was not involved in it.\n\nHATCH: Well, and finally, just once again, in the Garrett case, how many of the justices rejected your position in \nthat case?\n\nSUTTON: Well, not to be too technical, but it was the State of Alabama's position and I was arguing as their lawyer, \nbut four justices disagreed with the state's position in that case.\n\nHATCH: All right.  Well, you know, I think that, you know, there is a difference being an advocate for clients where \nyou have to give the best you can for them and being somebody who's out in mainstream of legal thought.  The fact \nof the matter is that apparently you not only were in the mainstream, you were overwhelmingly approved.\n\nWell, I have some other questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time and turn to Senator Leahy.\n\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nSenator Kennedy had touched on this and, of course, Senator Hatch has said that it is one thing to be advocating \nfor a client and another thing for stating your own position.  And all of us who have tried cases either at the trial level \nor at the appellate level understand that you have to take -- you take your clients' position. But, I look at the way you \ndo it.  You have -- we've discussed the Florida case.  You have advocate include claims and the state employees \nwith disabilities persons who are denied Medicaid benefits. One newspaper called you the leader of the states' \nrights revival. And, then you said yourself in a Legal Times article that you're quote, \"on the look out\" for the types \nof federalism cases you've become known for.\n\nIn fact, you once said that while advocating for states' rights doesn't get you invited to cocktail parties, that \nnevertheless you believe in this stuff.  So, isn't this a little bit different than (inaudible) walks in and to press the \nsudden, please take my position, here's what I'd like you to argue. If you feel I'm right on that, go forward.  And, \nrather what you're doing is looking for the particular cases that you can carry out your own agenda.  Is that correct?\n\n\n\nSUTTON: Thank you for an opportunity to discuss this.  I would respectfully disagree with that characterization, and \nhere's why.  I think the one general accusation\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Not to interrupt, but just when you disagree with having said what I have quoted you as saying in Legal \nTimes.\n\nSUTTON: No I didn't.  I wanted to explain what I said\u2026\n\nLEAHY: OK.\n\nSUTTON: \u2026 and what I meant by it.  I'm on the lookout for U.S. Supreme Court cases that I can be fairly accused \nof.  I was on the lookout for U.S. Supreme Court cases after I left the State of Ohio, had the good fortune to argue \nfour cases there while state solicitor. And, when I returned to Jones, Day in 1998 I really was interested in \ncontinuing in developing that practice. And, that is true.  I don't think it's accurate to say I was only looking for \nfederalism cases, a fairly difficult term.  I mean that covers a lot of things.  I could cover any case involving a state.  \nAnd, the proof of that is one case I sought out soon after leaving the state solicitor's office with the Becker versus \nMontgomery case that I referenced earlier, which was a pro se, indigent civil rights case brought against the State \nof Ohio where I was representing Dale Becker on a pro bono basis.  And, I will say I was willing to represent just \nabout anybody at the U.S. Supreme Court because I did want to develop a U.S. Supreme Court practice, which is \nnot easy to do in Columbus Ohio.  And I tried very hard to do that.  That's what I think -- that's what the first quote \nreferences and that's quite true.\n\nAs to the believing in this federalism stuff, well, in one sense, yes, of course, I do believe at the end of the day there \nis a checks and balances system here in our government, one that has checks and balances among the national \nbranches of the government and one that has a vertical checks and balances between Congress on the one hand \nand the states.  But, that's a principle as deeply respected as (inaudible).  The question is\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Do you have a feeling in your own mind, or interpretation in your own mind of the expression new \nfederalism?\n\nSUTTON: The new federalism that I'm familiar with is the one I teach at the Ohio State Law School which is about \nJustice Brennan's landmark article in 1977 explaining that state Supreme Court and state Supreme Court justices \nshould be aggressively construing their state Constitutions to further civil liberties and go beyond what Justice \nBrennan perceived a U.S. Supreme Court was not doing.\n\nLEAHY: You stated in that, the syllabus for that seminar that the most controversial results of the new federalism \nare, quote, \"increased disuniformity of the law and attempting new latitude for potentially result or entered judicial \ndecision making\", which is what I would hope that all of us up here would be concerned with.\n\nSUTTON: Well, you know, maybe I -- it's possible I'm misapprehending your question because I think\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEAHY: Let me state it another way, if you were confirmed as a judge would you be able to resist the temptation to \nuse results oriented reasoning to implement an agenda of new federalism?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely.  I thought the accusation that I wasn't doing enough of that.  I'm making the point the new \nfederalism that Justice Brennan advocated is one that has been advancing civil liberties for the last 25 years.  \nThat's the whole point of it, and doing it through the vehicle of state courts.  The state Constitutional law syllabus to \nwhich you're referring, I should point out is one written by Richard Cordjray (ph) who first -- as you may know, he's a \nDemocratic officer holder in the state of Ohio.  He created that class at the Ohio State University.  He's a friend of \nmind.  And we have co-taught the class, and we use the same syllabus he wrote.  But, I think you -- I'd be very \nsurprised, Senator Leahy, and maybe this proves I'm misapprehending your question, but I'd be very surprised if \nyou attended that class and listened to what we were talking about and saw the textbook we were using.  It's a \ntextbook that is advancing civil liberties at every turn.  That's the whole point of it.\n\n\n\nLEAHY: Would you feel it was a fair argument that someone said that you advocate states' rights over the national \nstandards?\n\nSUTTON: I've been on both sides -- I've been on virtually every side\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Which side are you on today?\n\nSUTTON: I'm on the side of trying very hard, very hard, Senator, to show you that I would be an objective judge.  \nAnd that the client I would have is the client that is the rule of law, not a former client, but the rule of law.  And that's \nthe great honor\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEAHY: Which do you prefer, states' rights or the national standards?\n\nSUTTON: I have no idea and it would depend on the client of the day.  Again, if you looked at the cases I've \nrepresented, you'd see I've been -- when I worked for the state I only had the option for three and a half years of \nrepresenting the state.\n\nLEAHY: Let me give you a couple examples, desegregation and the Jim Crow laws, the arguments were made that \na state's rights should override national standards, which side do you come down on?\n\nSUTTON: Well, the U.S. Supreme Court correctly rejected all of those. And, as a Court of Appeals judge I would \nobviously follow that U.S. Supreme Court precedent.\n\nLEAHY: Then, do you see the -- let me ask another way, absent a Supreme Court decision, on all fords, which do \nyou feel carries more weight, states' rights or national rights?\n\nSUTTON: You know, there's no doubt when a federal statute is passed, as the U.S. Supreme Court has made \nclear, it deserves -- there's a heavy presumption of constitutionality.  The court has said that in cases of holding \nfederal laws and striking them.  And, there's no doubt that a Court of Appeals judge has every obligation to follow \nthat presumption.\n\nLEAHY: You're well aware of the fact that there's been a number of writings, along by people strongly supporting \nyou, they feel you should be here because of your advocacy as states' rights at the expense of national standards.  \nAre they -- are your friends giving you too much credit?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely.  Absolutely.\n\nLEAHY: Well, the reason I ask that, and I don't ask it lightly, Professor, because I've said over and over again, I've \nbeen here with six different presidents, on this committee, and I voted an awful lot of Republican nominees and on \nthose occasions when they'd let us vote on the Democratic nominees, I've voted on those.  But, I've always had the \nsame standard.  I've also voted against nominees of both Democratic presidents and Republican presidents when I \nfelt that a litigant would not have a fair hearing.  And I have said so many times in this committee that to get my vote \nI must be convinced that a judge not only has the abilities, and you obviously have the legal abilities, but have the \nabilities and the moral character, but also if somebody came into that judge's courtroom, they wouldn't feel the case \nhad been prejudged either because of who they are, that they'd be treated differently depending upon which side of \nan issue, whether a plaintiff or defendant, whether they're rich, poor, Republican, Democrat or anything else.\n\nLEAHY: And, what I'm concerned about in your writings and actually and maybe you feel your friends have done \nyou a disservice in their strong support and the strong support of the president and others that you will be one who \nwould give far more weight on states' rights and a number of these federal laws over a national standard. Now, \nthe Supreme Court has done that, as you know, in a couple of areas.  They issued a series of five to four decisions \nunder the Commerce clause in U.S. versus Lopez they said that the Congress couldn't enact a law to prohibit guns \nin or near schools.  And Morrison they struck down a provision of federal law that allowed women to sue their \n\n\n\nattackers in federal court.  They held that Congress may not regulate what the court calls non-economic activity, \ngender motivated crimes and violence for example.\n\nNow, do you agree that Congress's power to regulate an intrastate activity should turn on whether the activity can \nbe classified as economic or non-economic?\n\nSUTTON: You know, I would agree, of course to do what the U.S. Supreme Court has said in that area, and my \nunderstanding of the Lopez, Morrison, Wicker versus Fillburn (ph), Jones versus Laughlin, Jones and Laughlin \ncases, is that while the holdings of the cases to date have been primarily economic, the court has never said it can \nonly be economic.  In fact, they specifically reserved that point in Morrison.  And, in terms of what I would do, I have \nno idea.  I don't know, you know, obviously I haven't gone through the process of what a judge would do and that \nprocess is critical to being a fair-minded judge and that's, you know, having an open mind about both party's \npositions, looking carefully at their briefs, looking for any indications that the Supreme Court has given as to what \nthe Court of Appeals or District Courts should do, listening with an open mind and a fair mind to what the oral \nargument is and then discussing the issue with your clerks, with your colleagues on the court and doing your best to \nget it right.  And I promise that's exactly what I would try to do.\n\nLEAHY: Well, for example, last year the House of Representatives passed a bill to prohibit human cloning.  Is \nhuman cloning more or less economic in nature than gun trafficking near schools or gender motivated crimes?\n\nSUTTON: You know, I have no idea.  The one thing, though, that that kind of law, partial birth abortion, all of the \ncontroversial issues that you all deal with, there's one thing that does have to be true, and I certainly agree with it, \nthat to the extent there is a principle of federalism that the U.S. Supreme Court is requiring lower courts to follow \nand it does have to be followed in an even handed way and there's just no doubt about that.\n\nLEAHY: Well, then let's talk about that, we've mentioned Lopez before and I mentioned that because the president \nin his first State of the Union message to the education is a top federal priority because education's a first essential \npart of job creation.  And I tend to agree with President Bush on that.  But, then the Supreme Court in U.S. versus \nLopez said that education is a non-economic activity, therefore outside the federal regulatory power.  Who's right, \nthe Supreme Court or the president?\n\nSUTTON: That's a great question and I'm happy\u2026\n\nLEAHY: I'm waiting for a great answer.\n\nSUTTON: \u2026 I'm happy that it's the U.S. Supreme Court that has to finally decide it.  The one thing I can assure is \nthat I would follow whatever decision they reached on that issue and adhere to it as every Court of Appeals just has \nto.\n\nLEAHY: Well, and we'll get back to this on another round.  But, I'm worried because the variety of the Constitution \nrequires deference of the sovereignty of states. But, when the Constitutional rights are asserted, due process \nprotection, reproductive rights, the right to be free of states trampling upon 14th Amendment freedoms, the \nstandard report we get from many, including many that support you, is that the techs of the Constitution doesn't \narticulate these rights they don't exist.  Can't the same point be made of a theory of states sovereignty?  I mean is \nthere any words explicitly in the Constitution giving out the right of state sovereignty?\n\nSUTTON: It's a very difficult question and, as I think you know, the U.S. Supreme Court has struggled with it for 200 \nyears.  I mean you can go back to Chisholm versus Georgia Hahns (ph) and then many of the cases in the last two \ndecades addressing it.  You know, of course it is up to the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of the day to decide \nwhether there is such a thing as sovereign immunity that applies to states, so far they have.  I guess I don't know \nwhat they're explanation would be\u2026\n\nLEAHY: What is you philosophy on it, without -- and I realize and I certainly will grant you this and I have no \nquestion you're honest enough in this when you say that the Supreme Court has a decision, you're going to follow \n\n\n\nthe start of decises. But, you're apt to get the -- you staying all the way up to the Court of Appeals, you'll apt to be \ngetting a lot of cases of first impression.  What is your philosophy on that?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I mean my philosophy, I mean the point of sovereign immunity, I just wanted to mention, is a \ndifficult one for the national government and the states.\n\nLEAHY: That's right.\n\nSUTTON: In other words, the national government has sovereign immunity as well, of course, that's this body and \nthat's not mentioned either.  So, that's I think the reason the court's been struggling. In terms of my philosophy, my \nphilosophy is about what's a good Court of Appeals judge and what it does and what the good Court of Appeals \njudge should do is look at every case with an exceedingly open mind and when they look at that case, do what I've \nactually tried it sometimes as an advocate, all times to do, see the world through other people's eyes, see the world \nthrough, when I'm an advocate, out of the judge's eyes, my opponent's eyes.  And, I think when you're a Court of \nAppeals judge it's a different perspective.  You're trying to see the world through different advocates.  We have this \nadversarial system. Their job, these lawyers, is to present the best conceivable arguments within reasonable \nbounds that advances their client's position and I would think I would do what I think a good Court of Appeals \njudges do and that's honestly and in a fair way consider those arguments and do your best job to get it right.  And, \ngetting it right nine out of 10 times is not a 100 percent of the times, turns on understanding what U.S. Supreme \nCourt precedent is and adhering to it.\n\nLEAHY: Is that a way of saying that people should have no fear depending upon who they are, whether they're \ntaking the position via the state or opposed to the state, of whether they're liberal, conservative or whatever coming \nbefore a Judge Sutton as compared to Professor Sutton?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely your honor, absolutely.\n\nLEAHY: You don't have to call me your honor.  I don't know if I've made that.\n\nSUTTON: Old habits die slowly.\n\nLEAHY: If it's any consolation and I'll yield in this, and if it's any consolation, I tried a huge number of cases before I \ncame here and I did a lot of appellate work.  And I found myself calling -- I was a junior most member of the Senate, \nI found myself referring to the chairman as his honor so many times that the inside my mouth was sore from the \nnumber of times I bit my tongue on the inside of my mouth on that.\n\nSUTTON: Well, forgive me.  I\u2026\n\nLEAHY: No, no\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEAHY: \u2026 do my best not to do it again.\n\nLEAHY: Thank you.\n\nHATCH: I always thought you liked to be called your honor.\n\nLEAHY: Excellency, Excellency.\n\nHATCH: Excellency.  Excellent, that's right.  I keep getting it wrong.\n\nSenator Chambliss?\n\nCHAMBLISS: Mr. Sutton, I was instructed to refer to Mr. Leahy as his honor.  So, don't -- we all do that.\n\n\n\nLet me just make a general comment about all the nominees we've got today.  I having looked at your bios and \nknowing the background of all six nominees, it's a pretty impressive group.  And, also, having been recommended \nby colleagues in this body that I have such great respect for, it's good to see legal minds of the caliber that all six of \nyou have to be up here today to be nominated.  And, I commend all of you for that.\n\nI'm a little bit disconcerted by some of the criticism that I've heard today and that I've read about with respect to our \nnominees, and that is, having practiced law for 26 years myself and having argued both sides of cases and \nparticularly early in my career, having been appointed to criminal cases that I didn't necessarily want to be \nappointed to.  But, those of us who practice law, which I think is by far the greatest profession in the world, there \nare positions which we have to take that are in the best interest of our clients, irrespective of what your personal \nfeelings are.  And, it's pretty obvious that when all six of our nominees have been in that same position, you've done \na heck of a job of representing your client, whatever the position that your client was in.  So, I think that kind of \ncriticism really doesn't do justice to you.\n\nI want to first of all, Judge Cook, ask you about some of this criticism that's been directed at you.  It's been said that \nyou dissent an awful lot and opinions that are rendered by the Ohio Supreme Court.  Well, again, having argued an \nawful lot of cases on appeal and having lost some of those cases, I was kind of glad to see that there some \ndissenting opinions that agreed with me.\n\nI want to ask you about one case in particular, though, the state ex rel. Bray v. Russell (ph).  In that you declared in \nyour dissenting opinion that in order for the court to declare a statute unconstitutional, and I quote, \"It must appear \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is incompatible with particular provisions.\" And in this particular case \nyou're dissent from the court's ruling meant that you would have allowed state prison boards to sentence convicted \ncriminals to extra time for bad time violations.  Would you please elaborate on your decision in that case and tell me \ngenerally what your views are on the constitutionality of statutes enacted by the general assembly in Ohio in your \ncase and at the federal level by the Congress?\n\nCOOK: Thank you, Senator.  The case to which you refer, indeed, I was a dissenter in that case.  But, the matter \ninvolved a statute that permitted the executive branch to impose what is called bad time on inmates for their \nbehavior or conduct during incarceration.  And the disparity between the majority and the dissent regarded the -- \njust differing views on the interpretation of the statute.\n\nIn that case, one of my colleagues, who is, if you'd look at percentages, typically is on the other side that I'm on, \nhe's typically not with me to join the dissent.  And, the standard of review that you mentioned that it has to be \nunconstitutional -- or beyond a reasonable doubt is the accepted standard in Ohio.  And the statute made -- this \nwas all about -- it all concerned separation of powers.  The majority felt that the -- that allowing the executive branch \nto impose additional time was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.  I merely opined that the doctrine \nregarded those situations where one branch interfered with another branch and in as much as the statute at hand \nallowed bad time as part of the original judicially imposed sentence. There was no separation of powers impediment \nto this statute.\n\nAnd, therefore, I would have upheld it.  But, as I say that was a dissenting view.  Yet, it was joined by one of the \nmembers of the court who is often said to be at odds with me.  So, I think it was a well-supported decision.\n\nCHAMBLISS: OK.  Thank you.\n\nMr. Sutton, it appears that a lot of your criticism, or a lot of criticism that's directed at you has to do with your work \non disability cases. And, obviously, from the questions that have been directed to you today that is a very prominent \narea of law in which you have practiced.  I was particularly concerned about a case which you handled for my state, \nthe State of Georgia, or I say you handled, you were involved in and I want to first of all before I ask you a question \nabout it for my colleagues I want to sort of set the stage for that.\n\nIn 1978 the State of Georgia adopted a program for treating mentally disabled citizens through what was called \ncommunity placements instead of institutions.  Due to limited resources the State of Georgia resisted assigning \n\n\n\nthese plaintiffs in the case that arose out of the situation existing regarding these placements to a community \nplacement.\n\nThe State of Georgia was sued by these plaintiffs, the actual person sued was the Director of DHR, Mr. Tony \nOlmstead.  So, it's been referred to as the Olmstead case, which I know you remember very clearly.  They claimed \nthat the State of Georgia discriminated against them under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  In this case the \nState of Georgia was sued by this group on an issue that all of us are extremely sensitive to and that's the issue of \na mental disability, and how and where those mentally disabled patients were to be placed.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you helped the State of Georgia argue this case before the Supreme Court or at least you \nparticipated in the preparation of the young lady who did argue that case before the Supreme Court.  And the basic \nargument was that the ADA did not require states to transfer individuals with mental disabilities into community \nsettings rather than institutions.\n\nWould you please tell a little bit about your involvement in that case, the argument you put forth and the actual \noutcome of that case?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, thank you, Senator.\n\nThe Olmstead case, I think went to the district courts, yes it did, the district court in Georgia, then the 11th Circuit \nand I did not have any involvement in the case at that point.\n\nSUTTON: But when the U.S. Supreme Court decided to review the 11th Circuit's decision in Olmstead, I was hired \nby the state to help them write what was two briefs in the case at the U.S. Supreme Court and help prepare Trisha \nDowning for the oral argument.  And, as you've acknowledged, the very -- the institutionalization's a difficult issue.  I \nmean, in fact, it's actually an easy issue in the states, every state supports it.  In fact, Georgia has a law that \nrequires the institutionalization for those who are capable of living in a community setting.  So, the rub in the case \nwas not that policy debate. That had long been decided in the late '70's and early '80's that everyone -- that every \nstate should move in this direction.\n\nBut, the problem I think Georgia must have run into was that they had a budget shortfall, something not dissimilar \nto what some states are having now and wasn't able to move individuals as quickly as they had in the past from \nstate hospital settings to community settings. And, so, when that happened, when that budget crunch happened, \nthey were sued under the ADA and the gist of the plaintiff's claim was that the state has to continue to move \npatients more quickly regardless of resources.  And, of course, even that's a very tricky issue.\n\nThe position we advocated primarily was the position of whether that money, you know, whether, no matter the \ncosts, the State of Georgia had to move every single patient as soon as they hired a lawyer and sued, or whether \nthere was a reasonableness component to this.  At the end of the day, all nine members of the court agreed there \nwas a reasonableness component, eight members of the court said it needed to be sent back to the Court of \nAppeals and eventually the district court to determine whether, in fact, the state had acted reasonably in not moving \nthese two plaintiffs into community settings.\n\nAnd, you know, I did my best to help the client.\n\nCHAMBLISS: Well, the attorney general in Georgia is a gentleman named Thurbert Baker who happens to be an \nelected democrat and is a good friend of mine and, as I told you after I talked to you earlier, I was going to check on \nyou.  And I did.  And Attorney General Baker had this to say about you, he said that \"Mr. Sutton is extremely \nintelligent.  He's a hard worker and he would have a great judicial temperament.\" And that temperament, \nparticularly, I think obviously we know you're mental capabilities, but for somebody who has worked very closely \nwith you to say that you have a good judicial temperament I think says volumes about you.\n\nOne other thing that I was impressed with about you, Mr. Sutton, is the fact that another constituent of mine, a lady \nnamed Beverly Benson Long, has written a letter to Senator Leahy with reference to your nomination.  And I want to \njust -- if this letter is not already in the record, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask that it be made a part of the record.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Without objection we'll make it part of the record.\n\nCHAMBLISS: Mrs. Long is the immediate past president of the World Federation for Mental Health.  She's been \npresident of the Mental Health Associations of Atlanta, the State of Georgia and the National Mental Health \nAssociation.  She was a commissioner on the president's commission on mental health, having been appointed by \nPresident Carter.  She has an extensive background in this field.\n\nAnd here's what she says about Mr. Sutton.  \"I have no doubt that Mr. Sutton would be an outstanding Circuit court \njudge and would rule fairly in all cases, including those involving persons with disabilities.\" She also says that she's \nfamiliar with the lobbying against Mr. Sutton by various person who advocate on behalf of the disabled.  Her \ncomment is that this effort is unfortunately and I am convinced is misguided.  Again, I think that's a high compliment \nto you, Mr. Sutton.  And I look forward to bringing all three of you to a vote in the very near future.\n\nThank you.\n\nHATCH: I thank you, Senator.\n\nWe will go to Senator Feinstein for 15 minutes.  And, then I think we will have a short break for about a half hour.  \nAnd give you a little bit of a break.\n\nSenator Feinstein?\n\nFEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.\n\nGood morning, Doctor Sutton.\n\nI've been surprised to see that your nomination has really generated a kind of intense opposition from the \ndisabilities community, even as far as my state, California, with a number of organizations weighing in very strongly. \nSo, I've been trying to figure out why.  And, one of the cases I looked at was a case that was mentioned earlier and \nthat was the Garrett case.\n\nAnd, you can correct me if I misstate any of these facts, but my understanding is that Ms. Garrett was a 56-year old \nwoman who was diagnosed with breast cancer.  She was the Director of Nursing for Women's Services at the \nUniversity of Alabama.  And she cared very much about her job.  So, she arranged to have her chemotherapy after \nwork on Friday to allow her the weekend to recover.  And she didn't really take very seriously the warning she got \nfrom a colleague that her supervisor didn't like sick people and had a history of getting rid of them.\n\nAnd, as it turned out her supervisor did try to get rid of her by locking her out of the computer and by beginning \nrecruitment for a replacement of her job. And, you represented the state, the University of Alabama in that case.  \nAnd you made this argument about the need for the Americans for Disabilities Act, and I quote, \"All 50 states have \nprovisions of their own designed to guard against disability discrimination by the sovereign.  These laws and \nadministrative regulations predate the passage of ADA, far exceed the rational basis requirements of equal \nprotection review.  All permit monetary relief against the sovereign.  And, in the end markedly over protect, rather \nthan under protect the constitutional rights of the disabled.\"\n\nHow do you reconcile that with Governor Hodges recent statement apologizing for South Carolina law, which \ninvoluntarily sterilized in the past decades a number of mental patients.  In essence, according to the governor, \nthese laws were believed, and this is a quote, \"to promote reproduction by people with good and healthy genes, \nand discourage reproduction by those with genes considered unfit.  The goal was a healthier population.  Instead \nthese laws allowed the state to create a second-class citizenship deprived of their most basic civil rights.\"\n\nHow do you reconcile your statement in this case, the statement by Governor Hodges which clearly shows the \ninsufficiency of state law to meet any kind of what would be considered a fair national standard?\n\nSUTTON: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nI'm not familiar with that statement, but I think I understand what it's about, and, so, I'll do my best to respond to it.\n\nFEINSTEIN: This is about the sterilization of mental patients.\n\nSUTTON: Exactly.  And, that's where I wanted to start.  The reply brief in that very case, Garrett, addressed that \nissue and that horrendous history in this country.  And it addressed it by talking about a case in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt where, of all people, Justice Holmes wrote in the Buck decision for the U.S. Supreme Court that, in fact, the \nvery for sterilization you're talking about, did not violate the United States Constitution.  Believe it or not, that case \nstill is on the books.\n\nWe did something, which was unusual for any state to do.  We said that case was wrongly decided and quoted \nJustice Souter for the excellent point that when Justice Holmes errors, he errors grandly. And, he did in that case.  \nAnd the brief on behalf of the state made that very point.  And, so, there was no debate about that issue.\n\nFEINSTEIN: But, that isn't my point.  In reading the two of them you're arguing in this case that state law offers \nsufficient protection, therefore, the Americans for Disabilities Act is really not necessary, that state law actually \noverprotects individuals with disabilities.\n\nSUTTON: Right.  I don't\u2026\n\nFEINSTEIN: To me is not correct.\n\nSUTTON: And, if we had argued that I could be accused of malpractice because that's not what we argued.  And \nthat's not what the state's position was and that's not what I as an advocate recommended\u2026\n\nFEINSTEIN: You didn't make this statement in your brief?\n\nSUTTON: I made that statement, but I want to put it in context.\n\nFEINSTEIN: OK.\n\nSUTTON: The issue in the Garrett case was a constitutional issue.  The issue was not whether the ADA was \nneeded.  The brief contains many statements to the effect of to its credit; the federal government passed the ADA.  \nSo, there are many statements conceding that Ms. Garrett could get her job back under the ADA.\n\nThe issue in the case arose because of the court's Seminole Tribe (ph) decision and that's the question of whether \nmoney damages were permissible.  And, in that setting the question, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, under \nthe City of Boerne, a decision that still to this day, no justice of the court has disagreed with, the question is whether \nthe states have violated the constitutional rights of their citizens.\n\nNow, the one thing I think the Senate and the Congress could certainly be frustrated with is the City of Boerne was \ndecided after the ADA was passed and that, of course, made it difficult for you to compile exactly the record that the \ncourt ultimately required.\n\nBut, the point, Senator, that the brief was making is we were applauding the 50 state laws that protected disability \nrights.  And we were simply making the point that with those laws in place it was difficult to show that the states \nwere not, since the law's been passed, violating the constitutional rights of their citizens.  Now, that position, keep \nin mind, is not a position I made up.  I mean I wasn't involved -- Obviously, I wasn't involved in the underlying \ndecision with Ms. Garrett.  I wasn't involved in the district court; I wasn't involved in the Court of Appeals.  These \nwere positions the Alabama attorney general's office had developed, made the constitutional challenge.  And when \nit got into the U.S. Supreme Court they asked me to argue the case for them and I did.\n\nBut, you know, maybe we didn't do as well as we could have, and the statements you read makes me worry about \nthat.  But, the brief was trying very hard to show that the states were being sensitive to disability rights.  And, I \nwould point out in Ms. Garrett's case she had a parallel claim under another federal law, Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, which applies wherever federal dollars are involved.  The University of Alabama gets federal \n\n\n\nmoney.  We specifically in a brief I wrote said the U.S. Supreme Court should not review the constitutionality of that \nissue.  That would be premature. And that issue is still in the lower courts. I mean at the end of the day Ms. Garrett \nmay get her money relief.  That hasn't been decided yet.\n\nFEINSTEIN: And let me ask you during a radio interview with Nina Totenberg on this very case you made this \nstatement, which puzzled me. There are legitimate reasons for treating the competent differently from the \nincompetent in certain settings.  And what the court has said for some time now is it's going to give states and the \nfederal government quite a bit of latitude when it comes to drawing those distinctions because these are very \ndifficult social issues and ones that political bodies in each area need quite a bit of latitude over. I'm puzzled what \nyou mean by treating the competent differently from the incompetent with respect to civil rights.\n\nSUTTON: Sure. I don't remember the statement, but I do understand the point, so I'm happy to address it.  The \npoint I assume I was addressing in response to a question from her relates to the court's City of Clayburn (ph) \ndecision, a U.S. Supreme Court case about what level of equal protection scrutiny individuals with disabilities get.  \nAnd what the court has said there, and presumably was the point I was making in this interview, was that most the \ntime in the equal protection setting what courts are doing is they're saying it makes -- it's not ever, if rarely, if ever, \nappropriate to make a distinction based on someone's status of their age, their race, their ethnic background, their \nreligious background and that presumptively their gender, presumptively those laws are invalid.\n\nWhen it comes to laws dealing with the disabled, in an odd sort of way, particularly in the recent decades, things \nare switched.  Why are they switched?  Because both federal and state governments happily have passed lots of \nlaws based exactly on the classification of disability precisely to provide accommodations for the disabled.  Of \ncourse, that's exactly what the ADA does. It makes classifications based on whether you're disabled or not.  So, I \nwas making that point that's a good thing.  And that's exactly the why this constitutional issue's so difficult.  It makes \none wonder whether, you know, the due process clause isn't a better vehicle for brining these arguments. But, the \ndistinction is a happy one.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.  If I might I'd like to change subjects for a minute and go to some questions \nabout the right to privacy.  Do you believe there's a constitutional right to privacy? And, if so, would you describe \nwhat you believe to be the key elements of that right?\n\nSUTTON: Well, the U.S. Supreme Court has made quite clear in a series of decisions that there is a 14th \nAmendment constitutional right to privacy, growing principally out of the substance of due process and the \nFourteenth Amendment.\n\nSUTTON: They've said that in many areas.  And, I can assure you, it's not an area where I've done a lot of litigation, \nso it's not that I have lots of familiarity with, but I can assure you that as a Court of Appeals judge I would follow the \nU.S. Supreme Court's decisions, instructions across the board in any case involving the right to privacy.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Does that apply to Roe v. Wade?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely.\n\nFEINSTEIN: So, what are your feelings about the Roe case?\n\nSUTTON: Well, you know, like many a law student and many a lawyer probably had many different views of it at \nvarious times.  I can say, as a Court of Appeals judge, the thing that would be very important to me is making sure \nthat I followed what the U.S. Supreme Court had required lower court judges to do, both in Roe and later in the \nCasey (ph) decision.  And that's exactly what I would do.\n\nFEINSTEIN: So, do you believe that Roe is a settled case?\n\nSUTTON: Well, from a Court of Appeals perspective, it sure is. I mean I can't think of any case that a Court of \nAppeals judge would say there's -- it's somehow not settled and the Court of Appeals judge would have a license to \ndo something different from the U.S. Supreme Court.  That's exactly the opposite of their oath.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: So, let me just put it a little more boldly.  Do you support the holding of Roe that women have a \nconstitutionally recognized and protected right to choose?\n\nSUTTON: I would absolutely follow that decision and Casey (ph) and every case before me that implicated it.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: I said we would break, but Senator Feingold has a meeting at 1 o'clock and he's asked if we can finish with \nand then we'll break for a half hour.\n\nFEINGOLD: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n\nMy apologies, Professor Sutton.\n\nHATCH: Do any of you need a break right now, because if we can just wait for another 15 minutes, we'll break?\n\nFEINGOLD: Perhaps this will shorten the afternoon.\n\nAnd, Mr. Chairman, I had planned an extensive critique of your decision to have all three of these people today.  \nBut, in light of your courtesy it will be a brief critique.\n\nHATCH: Well, that is very much appreciated.\n\nFEINGOLD: Mr. Chairman, I've just been so impressed with the way that you have run this committee in the past \nand your role as ranking members and always appreciated your fairness.  And, I just have to say that I would have \nto be in the camp of those who say that having all three of these distinguished nominees in the same day is not the \nway that you've done things in the past.  And, I note your letter where you suggest that in response to us that these \nnominees are not controversial.  Well, the fact is they're extremely qualified people, but I don't think it's in the eyes \nof the chairman to determine whether they're controversial or not.  That's sort of our job.\n\nAnd, these are controversial people\u2026\n\nHATCH: I'll tell you, that is the firs time that the poor chairman has been taken over the coals like that is all I can \nsay.\n\nFEINGOLD: Well, it's brutal.\n\nHATCH: That's all right.\n\nFEINGOLD: I certainly do understand the pressures on you with regard to this all the back and forth on this issue \nwith the administration and all these nominations.  But, I would urge that this not be done again, that we only have \none controversial or allegedly controversial nominee per hearing.\n\nHATCH: Well, Senator, if I could just interrupt you for a second without costing you any time.  This is important that \nwe move with these three at this time.  I'm going to try to an accommodate you, but I can't limit it to just one.  We \nheld I think 11 with two last time. Senator Biden's held one with three.  This is my one with three.  I can't guarantee \nyou I'll never do it again.  But, I think we ought to be able to move ahead and I'm prepared to, you know, to do what \nwe have to do.  But, I'll try to -- I'll certainly take all of my colleagues' advice into great consideration.\n\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nProfessor Sutton, I understand that you filed an amicus brief on behalf of the State of Alabama in Solid Waste \nAgency of Northern Cook County versus the United States Army Corp of Engineers.  In the brief you argued that in \npassing the Clean Water Act if Congress delegating authority to the corps along the promulgation of the migratory \n\n\n\nbird rule such a delegation represented, in your words, \"every measure of constitutional excess in full force.\" \nunquote, under the commerce clause.\n\nAs you know, the court, by a five to four majority, limited the authority of federal agencies to use the so-called \nmigratory bird rule as the basis for asserting Clean Water Act jurisdiction over non- advocable intrastate isolated \nwetlands, streams, ponds, and other water bodies.  In effect, the court's decision removed much of the Clean Water \nAct protection for between 30 to 60 percent of the nation's wetlands.\n\nAn estimate from my home state of Wisconsin suggested that 60 percent, 6-0, percent of the wetlands lost federal \nprotection in my state.  Wisconsin is not alone as Nebraska, Indiana, Delaware and other states face water loss that \nhave and will continue to have a devastating effect on our environment.\n\nNow, in response to this decision of the Supreme Court, my own state, Wisconsin, passed legislation to assume the \nregulation of waters no longer under federal jurisdiction.  But, many states have not followed suite.  So, last \nCongress I introduced a Clean Water Authority Restoration Act to clarify Congress's view that all waters of the \nUnited States, including those referred to as isolated, fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act.\n\nNow, is it your view that Congress's authority for passing the Clean Water Act stem solely from the commerce \nclause, or might one find reason for congressional authority over protection of wetland in, not just the commerce \nclause, but, perhaps, the property clause, the treaty clause, or the necessary and proper clause?\n\nSUTTON: Yes.  Thank you, Senator.  Obviously, in the federalism area environmental issues raise some issues \nthat aren't raised in other federalism cases.  And that's principally as a result of the externality problem that I'm sure \nyou're familiar with when one state does something that imposes no cost to them and imposes cost in another \nstate, whether it's water or air.  And I think the U.S. Supreme Court has been very attentive to that and the cases \nmake that clear.\n\nIn terms of writing that brief, again for a client in that case, it was a statutory interpretation case.  It was not a \nconstitutional case necessarily.  It was a statutory interpretation case first and foremost and that, of course, is how it \nultimately was resolved on the grounds you indicated.\n\nAnd, on behalf of the client, we made the argument that the underlying statute, and the underlying statute referred \nto federal jurisdiction over, quote, \"navigable waters\" and the position that was taken and actually the lead lawyer \nfor the case is someone who's done a lot of work in a lot of different areas in this, but took the view that navigable \ncan't possibly mean every, you know, water there is anywhere in the country.  It has to be water connected to \nsomething that's quote \"navigable\".  And we advanced that position of brief on behalf of that client.\n\nThe second argument that is made that I'm sure you're familiar with is what's called a constitutional avoidance \nargument.  And the notion of a constitutional avoidance argument is really it's a back up to a statutory interpretation \nargument.  And what lawyers are trying to do there and I really -- I do feel I had an obligation to make this \nargument, I think it would have been malpractice\u2026\n\nFEINGOLD: But, in an answer to my question, you don't rule out the possibility of congressional authority over \nprotection of wetlands based on the other clauses of the Constitution?\n\nSUTTON: Of course not, of course not.\n\nFEINGOLD: Let me ask a more general question.  In passing our federal environmental laws, Congress, in some \ncases seeks to justify such action on commerce clause grounds by describing the relationship between the \nresource we seek to protect and economic activities conducted in or effecting those resources that are part of \ninterstate commerce.  For example, in passing the Clean Water Act, Congress restricted discharges from point \nsources, such as manufacturing plants, which make products that are then sold in interstate commerce. Do you \nbelieve that such justifications, if included in the legislative history or congressional findings are insufficient to \nestablish the basis for congressional action to protect the environment under the Constitution?\n\n\n\nSUTTON: Well, I have to acknowledge it's not something I know a lot about in the laws that you're referring to.  So, \nit's not something I've dealt with and I don't know whether it's something that could come before me as a judge.  I \ndo know that the U.S. Supreme Court decisions give broad deference to Congress and they have given broad \ndeference to Congress in the environmental arena.  In fact, I'm not aware of -- there probably is such a case, \nsomeone's going to find it.  But, I'm just not aware of a case where they've struck an environmental law on the \nground that it exceeded Congress's commerce clause powers.  So, it seems to me those precedence support what \nyou're suggesting.  And if that's true, Court of Appeals judges would have to follow them.\n\nFEINGOLD: Well, then let's turn to a better decision of Justice Holmes, whose been discussed before.  In 1920 \nJustice Holmes explained that the federal government must provide protection for migratory birds because actions \nby the states individually would be ineffectual. He said migratory birds can be protected only by national action in \nconcert with that of another power.  We see nothing in the Constitution that compels the government to sit by why a \nfood supply is cut off and the protectors of our forest and our crops are destroyed.  It is not sufficient to rely upon \nthe states, Justice Holmes wrote.\n\nYour brief in the Swank (ph) case takes a directly contrary position. Whereas, Justice Holmes viewed the protection \nof migratory birds and wetlands as a national interest of very nearly the first magnitude you argued that it is truly a \nmatter of local oversight.\n\nDo you really believe that the protection of these habitats is simply just a matter of local oversight?  In what \ncircumstances are federal protections warranted?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, I am -- it's been awhile, I think the case you're referring to may be Missouri versus Holland (ph).  It's \nbeen a while since I've read it.  I'm not sure if I've got the right case.  But, I thought if it's the case I'm thinking of, I \nthought it was a case that was about Congress's treaty powers.  I may be wrong about that.  And, obviously, that \nwas not implicated at all in the Cook County case that you're referring to.\n\nBut, the point I would make is, again, I was simply representing a client and it was first and foremost a statutory \ninterpretation case.  The constitutional arguments that were made were made as constitutional avoidance \narguments.  And the whole premise of that argument is asking the court not to reach the constitutional argument. \nThat's why an advocate makes that argument.  They're signaling to the court you do not want to wrestle with the \ndifficult constitutional issues raised by this law.  And you shouldn't do that.  And the best way to do that is to deal \nwith the case on a statutory interpretation grounds and that's what the court ultimately did.\n\nFEINGOLD: Fair enough.  In the amicus brief you also argued that the interstate commerce justifications for \nregulating wetlands used by migratory birds were false because activities conducted in wetlands such as bird \nwatching and hunting are non-economic.  Well, in my home state of Wisconsin, hunters spend $500 million on deer \nhunting alone in 2002.  And we have been deeply concerned that the emergence of chronic wasting disease in our \nstate has curbed the hunting effort and has hurt our economy.\n\nCan you explain why you consider these activities to be non- economic?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I'm not a hunter.  I've never fired a gun.  So, maybe that's my problem.  I didn't appreciate that fact \nand maybe that's exactly what the court should have said in dealing with that argument.  But, again, it was part of a \nconstitutional avoidance argument that the court didn't reach and we were actually encouraging them not to reach \nin that case.\n\nFEINGOLD: Let me ask you, finally in this point, more generally, if we were to try to protect these habitats under \nyour argument, we would in effect have the only differing state Clean Water Act for protection.  How can you ensure \nAmericans that under this system, your vision of the way this works, that there would be any sort of floor of national \nenvironmental protections or any uniformed standard for clean water in this country?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I think that point goes exactly to what you were saying Justice Holmes said in the case that I may \nbe misremembering. But, at least what you were reading from the case makes clear the point I said at the outset.  \nThat environmental concerns the U.S. -- environmental laws and environmental cases the U.S. Supreme Court has \n\n\n\nmade clear there are externality issues that alter the equation.  And the reason they alter the equation is exactly the \nreason you're suggesting.  And that reason is that sometimes one state, one city, one county, can impose cost, \nenvironmental costs, pollution costs on others because of the direction of the wind, the direction of the water, a \nnavigable water flows, and that's exactly why Congress has entered that sphere and it's exactly why the U.S. \nSupreme Court has said they should enter that sphere.  And Court of Appeals judges would be obligated to follow \nthose decisions and I certainly would be happy to.\n\nFEINGOLD: I appreciate your answers to those questions. Let me turn to the age discrimination issue, Kimel \ndecision, which came down in 2000.  In Kimel versus Florida Board of Regents, again the Supreme Court ruled five \nto four that state employees could not bring private suits for monetary damages against states under the age \ndiscrimination and employment act.  As you know the ADA has a federal law that prohibit employees, including \nstates to refuse to hire, to discharge or to otherwise discriminate against an employee based on an employee's age.\n\nThe majority of the court found that while Congress intended to abrogate states' immunity, that abrogation \nexceeded Congress's authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nDo you believe that older workers who are employed by private businesses are entitled to protection under federal \ncivil rights laws like the Age Discrimination and Employment Act?\n\nSUTTON: I'd like to talk about that case, but of course the ADA requires that very thing.  The brief for the State of \nFlorida made it quite clear that the ADA did protect all state employees and federal employees and private \nemployees when it comes to relief like getting your job back, in some cases, back pay.  The underlying issue in that \ncase which divided the court along the five four grounds to which you're referring was not the question of Section 5 \npower, all right, that the question of whether Congress had permissibly used its Section 5 power in passing the \nADA.\n\nThe question that divided the court along five four grounds was the issue of whether commerce cause legislation, \nbecause everyone agrees the ADEA was also commerce clause legislation, whether that type of legislation, that \nsource of constitutional authority could give Congress the right to create money damages action.  I should tell you \nthat was not something we briefed in that case.  The Seminole Tribe (ph) issue did not come up either oral \nargument or in the briefing.  But, it was how the court broke down.  Not one justice, not one of nine, wrote an \nopinion disagreeing with the Section 5 interpretation we advanced.\n\nFEINGOLD: Well, let me ask you this, do you believe it was wrong for Congress to enact the ADEA in the first \nplace?\n\nSUTTON: Of course not.\n\nFEINGOLD: Confirmed the Sixth Circuit and legislation restoring the right of older state workers to sue their state \nemployees were enacted and became the law of the land.  How would you treat a claim of age discrimination \nagainst a state before you? Would you uphold the new federal law?\n\nSUTTON: I mean I would do exactly what, you know, the U.S. Supreme Court required in that area.  And the notion \nthat the ADEA could be struck is borderline laughable.  I mean there's a case, I think Wisconsin -- Wyoming, \nexcuse me, wrong state.  I can see why I said Wisconsin.  Wyoming versus the EOC in which the court specifically \nupheld the ADEA under Congress's commerce clause powers. So, of course, a Court of Appeals judge would be \nobligated to follow that law and enforce it.\n\nFEINGOLD: Thank you very much.  I'll wait for further rounds for other questions so that people can take a break.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you, Senator Feingold.\n\nWe're going to give you until 1:30, which is almost 45 minutes. So we'll recess for 45 minutes and I'm going to start \nprecisely at 1:30.  With that we'll recess until 1:30.\n\n(RECESS)\n\n\n\nHATCH: We'll call this meeting to order again.\n\nHATCH: I don't see any other senators here at this time, so I'll just start it off with you, Mr. Roberts.  I want to ask a \nfew questions with you, and then, hopefully, if I have enough time, Justice Cook, I'll ask a few of you as well.\n\nAnd we now have this timer, so that poor guy doesn't have to stand there with a little slip of paper.  I felt sorry for \nhim.\n\nIt seems to me that both Mr. Roberts and Mr. Sutton are being criticized for positions they have taken as attorneys \nrepresenting clients.  Now, this is patently unfair, and it's inappropriate, because attorneys do represent clients, and \nthey shouldn't be judged by who their clients are.  Any of us who have tried cases know that sometimes our clients \nmay not be savory, but their case may be a good case.  Who knows?\n\nAttorneys are required to represent their clients, and this is the case whether their client is the United States \ngovernment, a state government, a private citizen, or a corporation.  And this fact is so fundamental that it should \ngo beyond reproach.\n\nIn any legal matter, the arguments a lawyer makes in the role of a zealous advocate on behalf of a client are no \nmeasure of how that lawyer would rule if he were handling the same matter as a neutral and detached judge.  And I \nthink it's very unfair to imply that such a nominee would not follow the law.\n\nNow, this is because lawyers have an ethical obligation to make all reasonable arguments that will advance their \nclient's interest. According to Rule 3.1 of the ABA's model rules of professional conduct, a lawyer may make any \nargument if, quote, \"there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith \nargument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law,\" unquote.  Now, lawyers would violate their \nethical duties to their client if they made only arguments with which they would agree were they the judge, or a \njudge.\n\nNow, Mr. Roberts, although my Democratic colleagues and some in the Senate and elsewhere have tried to paint \nyou as an extremist, the truth is that you are a well respected appellate lawyer who has represented an extremely \ndiverse group of clients before the courts. In fact, you have often represented clients in what is considered to be \nthe so-called, quote, \"liberal,\" unquote, position on issues, and I'd just like to ask you about a few of these cases.\n\nIn the case of Berry (ph) v. Little, you represented welfare recipients in the District of Columbia, right?\n\nROBERTS: That's correct, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: You took this case on a pro bono basis.  Is that correct?\n\nROBERTS: Yes.\n\nHATCH: Pro bono means that you didn't get paid for it.\n\nROBERTS: No, I did not.\n\nHATCH: You voluntarily represented these people and gave services to them.\n\nROBERTS: Yes.\n\nHATCH: Now, in another case, Hudson v. McMillian (ph), you successfully argued before the Supreme Court the \nclaims of a prison inmate who alleged cruel and unusual punishment, didn't you?\n\nROBERTS: Yes.  I was representing the United States in that case.  We filed a brief supporting the prisoner's claim \nthat his 8th Amendment rights had been violated by a beating.\n\nHATCH: In Rice v. Kiatonna (ph), you argued on behalf of Hawaii's Democratic attorney general and governor, both \nDemocrats, in favor of a race conscious program to benefit native Hawaiians, right?\n\n\n\nROBERTS: That's correct, Mr. Chairman.  It's one of several cases that I found particularly gratifying where \nDemocratic state attorneys general have retained me to represent their state in the Supreme Court.  It's happened \non several other occasions as well.\n\nAnd a group of Democratic attorneys general, as well as a couple of Republican attorneys general, retained me to \nargue the Microsoft anti-trust case in the D.C. Circuit.  I found that particularly gratifying, because it indicated that \nthey thought my abilities were such that I would be able to represent them effectively and certainly wouldn't be \ndissuaded in any way by any political considerations.\n\nHATCH: Let's talk about the Tahoe Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.  In that case, \nyou represented a state regulatory agency before the Supreme Court, arguing in favor of limits on property \ndevelopment and in support of protection of the Lake Tahoe area.  Is that correct?\n\nROBERTS: That's correct, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Finally, in the 2001 landmark Microsoft anti-trust case, you argued on behalf of the Clinton Justice \nDepartment.  Who asked you to do that?\n\nROBERTS: It was the group of states that had jointly pursued the litigation with the federal government.  So it was \nactually the Democratic and Republican attorneys general representing their states that retained me to argue for \nthem.\n\nHATCH: So you argued primarily on behalf of Democratic state attorneys.  Is that right?\n\nROBERTS: This is true.\n\nHATCH: Well, Mr. Roberts, a Legal Times article that ran last May described you as, quote, \"someone who has \nrepresented clients on both the conservative side and the liberal side of ideologically charged cases, and who has \nencountered no plausible criticism of his fitness to serve,\" unquote.  I think these cases that I've just mentioned, that \nI've asked you about, illustrate this point perfectly, and I completely agree.  I have yet to hear any plausible criticism \nof your fitness to serve in this very important position.\n\nNow, let me turn to you, Justice Cook, because I think it's important that we at least look at some of the things that \nhave been said about you.  It's been alleged by a few trial attorney interest groups that you dissent too much, that \nyou have written too many dissenting opinions, or that you have a, quote, \"troubling pattern,\" unquote, of dissenting.\n\nOf course, this charge is easy to make, and it seems compelling on its face.  However, out of basic fairness to you, \nJustice Cook, we should all recognize that these allegations do the work of implying that you regularly disregard \nprecedent or favor certain parties without necessarily demonstrating that you do anything but conscientiously abide \nby precedent and faithfully interpret and apply the law.\n\nSince the charge has been made, however, Justice Cook, let me ask you a few questions about your record as an \nOhio state judge or justice.  In general, Justice Cook, what would you say compels you to write or join in a dissent?\n\nCOOK: On those occasions, Mr. Chairman, where -- and the number has been cited -- there are occasions in my \nseven years where I write dissents, and, more often than others on the court, I'm quite often the one who writes for \nthe court in dissents.  But the dissenting -- the importance of dissent in any court is to further the law.  It's a matter \nof fairness.\n\nOn occasions, my dissents result from a disagreement about the text at hand, a fair reading of the text, procedural \nmatters, sometimes a disagreement on the statute of limitations.  It's not often a matter of -- as has been implied, \nit's not a matter of my particular bent or preference for any side of a case.  It's simply really the reasoned \nelaboration of principle is the reason why any judge is moved to dissent.\n\nHATCH: So I understand that you also served as a judge for the Ohio Court of Appeals for -- was it four years?\n\n\n\nCOOK: Yes.\n\nHATCH: I also understand that as a member of the Court of Appeals, you decided over 1,000 cases.\n\nCOOK: That's correct.\n\nHATCH: How many times were you reversed by the Ohio Supreme Court?\n\nCOOK: What's been cited here -- it's less than 1 percent of my decisions were ever reversed.\n\nHATCH: Do you know how many times the Ohio Supreme Court reversed an opinion in which you joined?\n\nCOOK: It was fewer than 10 cases.  The stats are fairly low.  As a percentage\u2026\n\nHATCH: It's about a 1 percent reversal.\n\nCOOK: Yes.  The percentage is less than 1 percent.\n\nHATCH: I understand that the United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in three cases the Ohio Supreme \nCourt has decided, and in all three cases, the Supreme Court reversed -- in all three cases, Justice Cook, I \nunderstand that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with your dissent, and that you were the only one of the seven \njustices who ruled correctly in accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court's ultimate resolution of the federal \nconstitutional issues in all three cases.  Is that correct?\n\nCOOK: That's correct.\n\nHATCH: In State v. Robinette, Justice Cook, you joined the dissent, arguing that the court majority has developed a \nrule that was contrary to the Supreme Court precedent.  The U.S. Supreme Court agreed and reversed the ruling.  \nIs that right?\n\nCOOK: Yes.\n\nHATCH: Agreed with you.\n\nCOOK: Yes, they did.\n\nHATCH: In American Association of University Professors, Central State University Chapter v. Central State \nUniversity, you wrote the dissenting opinion, and the U.S. Supreme Court again agreed with you.\n\nCOOK: Not only did it agree, we were pretty excited about the fact that they quoted the language of the dissent.\n\nHATCH: That's great.\n\nCOOK: That doesn't happen often.\n\nHATCH: In other words, they even quoted from your dissent.\n\nCOOK: Yes.\n\nHATCH: That's kind of a badge of honor to\u2026\n\nCOOK: It was relished in my chambers.\n\nHATCH: I see.  Well, in State v. Riner (ph), the Ohio court reversed the conviction of manslaughter against a father \nwho killed his two-month-old infant son on the grounds that the babysitter, who refused to testify but denied \ninvolvement in the infant's death, did not have a valid Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and was, \ntherefore, improperly denied transactional immunity.  You dissented in that, right?\n\n\n\nCOOK: I did. I was the sole dissenter.\n\nHATCH: Could you tell us why?\n\nCOOK: Well, my dissent essentially set forth a fundamental principle that the guilty and the innocent enjoy a right \nagainst self- incrimination.  And so the fact that she denied -- this particular witness was granted transactional \nimmunity because she denied all culpability did not deny her the right to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege, as \nshe did.\n\nHATCH: Well, you, in dissent, then, to use my terms, argued that the immunity was proper because the babysitter \nhad reasonable cause to believe that her answers could put her in danger.\n\nCOOK: That's right.  She could provide a link.  In fact, the father's defense was that, indeed, it was the babysitter \nwho had shaken this infant and killed the infant.\n\nHATCH: I see.  The Supreme Court again of the United States of America agreed with a dissent -- with your dissent \n-- and you were the sole dissenter, right?\n\nCOOK: That's right.\n\nHATCH: And ruled that the babysitter was entitled to immunity, because despite her claim of innocence, she had \nreasonable cause to apprehend danger from her answers at trial.\n\nCOOK: Yes.  And, happily, that decision by the U.S. Supreme Court was nine to nothing.  So it was unanimous.\n\nHATCH: Justice Cook, a few others have charged that the so- called objective observers view the Ohio Supreme \nCourt as a moderate one, and that your dissenting opinions put you outside the mainstream, and I think that's a \npretty strange charge, between you and me. The allegation that the court is seen by most objective observers as \nmoderate and bipartisan belies the facts.\n\nLet me quote what Ohio newspaper editorials have said -- and I'll put all these editorials in the record, without \nobjection.  The Plain Dealer said in endorsing Justice Cook and Terrence O'Donnell in the 2000 judicial election, \nquote, \"Both are Republican nominees, but their party labels are not nearly as critical as their shared philosophy of \njudicial restraint.  By contrast, success for their opponents would enhance the prospect that a majority of the seven- \nmember court would continue on a controversial course of judicial activism best illustrated in 4-3 decisions,\" \nunquote.\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch wrote \"A majority on the Ohio Supreme Court has confused its role of checking the powers \nof the General Assembly. The court instead has turned into a legislative bulldozer upending whatever law conflicts \nwith the ideological bent of the majority, legal and constitutional principles be damned,\" unquote.\n\nAre you familiar with those?\n\nCOOK: Yes, I am.\n\nHATCH: The Ohio Beacon Journal editorialized \"Those who watch the Ohio high court know Cook is no ideologue.  \nShe has been a voice of restraint in opposition to a court majority determined to chart an aggressive course, acting \nas a problem solver, as (OFF-MIKE), more than jurists.\"\n\nCOOK: That's a common,,,\n\nHATCH: Now, it appears to me, Justice Cook, that you possess an excellent understanding of your role as a judge \ncharged with faithfully and conscientiously following precedent and upholding the Constitution, even if that means \nthat, occasionally, you have to dissent, or even more than occasionally, you have to dissent.  And that's the point I \nthink I'd like to make.\n\nMy time is just about up.  I'll turn to the distinguished senator from New York.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nLEAHY: Before you do -- just one number, and i wasn't quite sure of it, because it's been mentioned by Senator \nDeWine and yourself and Senator Hatch.  The reversals by the Ohio Supreme Court -- that was 1 percent of all \nyour cases that were appealed to the\u2026\n\nCOOK: That's right.  I think the numbers are something like in six of the cases out of 1,000 that I wrote.\n\nLEAHY: How many were appealed to the\u2026\n\nCOOK: Oh, gee.  I'm afraid I don't know that.\n\nLEAHY: Most of them?\n\nCOOK: No, I wouldn't say that.  The Ohio Supreme Court is a certiorari court, so they choose their cases and\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Do you know how many of your cases went up offhand?\n\nCOOK: I'm afraid I don't, Senator Leahy.\n\nLEAHY: About 500, 200?\n\nCOOK: In fact, I really wouldn't have any idea, because that's not -- I never did pay attention and keep track of the \nones that were appealed.  I knew the ones that were accepted, and those are the statistics we have.  But how many \nwere appealed, I actually don't know.\n\nLEAHY: You know how many were accepted.  That's really what I mean.\n\nCOOK: Yes.\n\nLEAHY: How many were accepted on appeal, 200?\n\nCOOK: I could get that for you.  I would be making a wild guess, and a wild guess might be 50.\n\nLEAHY: And if it was 50 -- so it's six out of 50 that were reversed.\n\nHATCH: Well, she doesn't know.\n\nLEAHY: That's okay.  Well, if you could get me the number for the record, please -- I just -- because, obviously, you \nhave a lot of cases that were never appealed or never -- or cert was never granted.\n\nCOOK: That's right.\n\nLEAHY: Thank you.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Senator Schumer?\n\nSCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I want to make a couple more comments just about the procedures \nhere, and then I'll get into questions.  I'll start with Professor Sutton.\n\nBut first, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You did re-notice -- after I brought up the hearing, you re-noticed it \nfrom Tuesday to Wednesday, so that'll comply with the committee rule that we have one week's notice, and I want \nto thank you for that.  And, as well, originally, we were going to have five-minute periods, I was told, and we asked \nyou to move it up to 15, and 15 is adequate, and we appreciate that.\n\n\n\nYou know, what we're trying to do here is get a feeling that this is real, that these are real -- you know, for us, for \nmany of us, this is really significant, but we worry about the others.  One thing I would ask you, Mr. Chairman -- \ncould we get notification by today as to which judges or which nominees we're going to have before us next \nWednesday?\n\nHATCH: I think so.  I've already told staff to try and -- our obligation is to give notice of the hearing, but I would like \nto give you as much -- I had told Senator Leahy at least two weeks ago who was going to be on this\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Maybe my memory has\u2026\n\nHATCH: Senator Leahy's memory once again is faulty?\n\nLEAHY: \u2026 has slipped.\n\nHATCH: Well, whatever.  I did tell you.\n\nLEAHY: I know that you want to give us enough time to look at them, because to quote a distinguished chairman of \nthis committee, \"The chairman will schedule a hearing for a nominee only after thorough review of the nominee's \npreliminary information.  Obviously, that's a long process, as it should -- as it must be.  After all, these are lifetime \nappointments,\" so said Senator Orrin Hatch, my dear friend, the former chairman.\n\nHATCH: Oh, my goodness.\n\nLEAHY: You never know that -- that's when I come back to haunt you, Orrin.\n\nHATCH: Well, let me\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: I guess the point I want to make is that having three substantially controversial nominees to important \ncourts of appeal is brand new.  The notice, as I say, has not been thorough, and we don't even have committee \nrules yet.  We don't.  We haven't discussed what's happening with the blue slip.  We haven't discussed any of the \nother kinds of rules that this committee has always prided itself on having.\n\nAnd then to boot today, there were so few questions asked by people on the minority side, it just almost seemed \nlike a rush to judgment.  Let's just get this -- I mean, majority side -- minority side, we're going to ask plenty of \nquestions.  It's wishful thinking that we were the majority side, at least for me.\n\nBut no questions asked, and it almost seems like, you know, that it's a done deal to too many people on this \ncommittee.  The White House says put them in, get them done as fast as you can, as few questions as possible, \nand we'll just move them, and I worry about that.\n\nI worry about it from a constitutional perspective, because there should be real advise and consent, whether you \nagree, whether you're the same party or the different party, in terms of who's in the White House, and I would just \nhope we could go back to some of that.  I think even during the worst of times, when we were in charge, we were \nnever accused of rushing through people and\u2026\n\nHATCH: I think that's a fair characterization by itself.  Let me just say 630 days, it seems to me, is enough notice, \nand it certainly is enough time to evaluate these people.\n\nSCHUMER: Well, you know, you say that, but, officially, we didn't receive notice until last night, and\u2026\n\nHATCH: We will try to remedy that.\n\nSCHUMER: \u2026 and there are reasons for that, and we ought to have them.  I mean, let's hope this is all on the level, \nand, certainly, at least fair process would help give it at least the appearance that that is the case.\n\nI now want to direct some of my questions at Professor Sutton. Professor, you've probably been advised by those \nwho have prepped you for this confirmation that I have three criteria I use when I weigh nominees, whether in \n\n\n\nhelping choose them in New York, which I used to do -- maybe still will do a little bit -- but also in who I judge. It's \nexcellence, moderation, diversity.\n\nExcellence, legal excellence -- these are such vital positions that you don't want some political hack or somebody \nwho's somebody's friend to occupy them.  I have no doubt you'll meet that criterion. You're a legally excellent mind.\n\nThe second criterion I have is moderation.  I don't like judges too far left or too far right.  And, in fact, in my own \njudicial review committee, when people have come to me with some very liberal judges, well known liberals on the \nNew York bench, I've not chosen to select them, because I think judges who are too far left and too far right want \nto make law themselves.\n\nThey have such a passion for what is right and what is wrong that instead of interpreting the law, which is what the \nConstitution says they should do, they end up making the law.  And, in fact, a lot of the conservative critique of the \nliberal courts of the '60s and '70s was shaped by that notion, and I find it ironic that the conservative movement is \ndoing the same exact thing now that they criticized people for.\n\nIt's a little bit of a mirror image of telling us that now we ought to move judges on, say, the Court of Appeals, when \nwe were constantly told when President Clinton was president we don't need any more judges.  The caseload is the \nsame, and yet all of a sudden, we have -- we're pushing judges through, and that's, again, what we have to live with \nhere.  But the lack of consistency in all of this is mind bogging and, again, makes you think that this is not on the \nlevel, which would be a shame for the Constitution and for the judiciary.  So that's my second criterion.\n\nAnd the third one is diversity.  I don't think the judge should -- that the bench should be white males.  You don't \nmeet the diversity criterion, but you can't judge it by one person, and that's not a problem for me here.\n\nBut the moderation is.  And, frankly, by your record, to me, you're hardly a moderate.  You have pointed views that \nare way beyond, I think, what most people would consider the mainstream, and you've helped shape and change \nthe courts.\n\nLet me just go over a little history.  Over the past several years, the Rehnquist Supreme Court has slowly and \nsteadily effected a revolution, and they've engaged, in my judgment, at least, in startling acts of judicial activism, \nreaching out to strike down law after law that Congress has passed to protect women and workers, the \nenvironment, the disabled, children, and senior citizens.  And this court is leading the country down a dangerous \npath where it seems states' rights predominate over people's rights.\n\nThey call it federalism, or they call it something else, but it's really just that. We almost want to go back, where there \nwould be the Eleventh Amendment or the commerce clause, to the 1890s, because there's such anger and hatred \nfor the federal government.  And so I worry about that.\n\nAnd you, Professor Sutton, you're a primary engineer of the road that court is traveling.  We all know that.  This is \nnot just you happening to be plucked out as one of a thousand lawyers and say please represent us on this case.\n\nWhen you look at cases that make up the Rehnquist court's revolution, Sandoval, Garrett, Kimel, City of Burney \n(ph), have particular meaning, and those are the cases that comprise the most significant parts of your impressive \nresume.\n\nSCHUMER: I've been struck by the comments that you're nothing but a -- you didn't say a country lawyer, but you \nmight as well -- a lawyer just representing your clients, that you don't really believe in the arguments you've made, \nor your beliefs were irrelevant and you were just doing your job.\n\nBut I think anyone who's reviewed your record can see that's not the case.  You weren't just sort of like a corporate \nattorney who was picked to work for one corporation or then another.  You've taken a leadership role in the \nfederalist society which has pushed this line of reasoning and the states' rights agenda.  You've made public \ncomments that you love the states' rights movement.  You advance your agenda with a genuine ardor and passion, \nadvocating positions that go even beyond where Justices Scalia and Rehnquist and Thomas have been willing to \ngo.\n\n\n\nI'm just going to read, and then ask that they be inserted in the record, a number of quotes from you.  At least \nthey're all footnoted, and I would ask unanimous consent that the whole statement be added to the record with the \nfootnotes.\n\nHATCH: Without objection.\n\nSCHUMER: \"Talking about this federalism, this states' rights, it doesn't just get me invited to cocktail parties\" -- \nthese are your quotes -- \"but I love these issues.  I believe in this federalism stuff.\"\n\nHere's another one: \"First, the public has to understand that the charges of judicial activism that have been raised, \nparticularly in the most recent term, are simply inaccurate.  The charge goes like this: How is it that justices who \nbelieve in judicial restraints are now striking down all these federal laws?  The argument, however, rests on a false \npremise\" -- these are your words.  These are not quoted in a case.  This is from an article that you wrote.\n\n\"In a federalism case\" -- again your words -- \"there is invariably a battle between the states and the federal \ngovernment over a legislative prerogative.  The result is a zero sum gain in which one or the other law-making \npower must fall.\"\n\nHere's another one: \"The public needs to understand that federalism is ultimately a neutral principle.\" Many of us \nwould disagree with that.  That's in the mind of the beholder, but it's certainly a view of yours, not who you're \nrepresenting, but you. \"Federalism merely determines the allocation of power.  It says nothing about what particular \npolicies should be adopted by those who have power.\"\n\nAnd it goes on and on and on.  You discuss the Morrison case, quote, \"Unexamined deference to VAWA -- \nViolence Against Women Act -- findings would have created another problem as well.  It would give to any \ncongressional staffer with a laptop the ultimate marbery (ph) power to have final say over what amounts to \ninterstate commerce and thus what represents the limits on Congress' commerce clause powers.\"\n\nI'm not -- right now, I disagree with these, but that's not my point here.  My point is you're not simply a lawyer who \nis chosen to represent cases.  You have been a passionate advocate for this point of view, and you state it not only \nwhen you represent a client before a court, but you state it in articles, you state it in conversation, et cetera.\n\nLet me just say to you that -- and this is the same question I asked Attorney General Ashcroft when he was here, \nalthough that was different, because he's in the same branch of government as the president, and we give the \npresident a little more deference in that regard than we do with Article 3.  You are passionate, you have strong \nbeliefs that most objective observers would say -- whether you think they're right or wrong -- is way out beyond the \nmainstream.  Many of the things you've said, as I said, neither Scalia nor Thomas nor Rehnquist has said in \nopinions.\n\nSo how can we believe that you, when you've been such an impassioned and zealous advocate for so long, can \njust turn it off? How do you abandon all that you have fought for -- you've been a seminal voice in all of this for so \nlong -- given the fact that we all know that corporate lawyers, looking at the same fact case, don't always come \nunder 100 judges with the same answer.\n\nSUTTON: May I?\n\nSCHUMER: Please.\n\nSUTTON: Thank you, Senator.  You've raised several issues, and I'll do my best to get to as many of them as \npossible.\n\nFirst and foremost, someone who has the good fortune, first, of being nominated and then the good fortune of being \nconfirmed by the Senate takes an oath.  And when you take an oath, the whole point at that stage in your career is \nthat your client is no longer your personal views, no longer a person for whom you advocated, that your client is the \nrule of law.\n\n\n\nAs a Court of Appeals judge, your objective, of course, is to do whatever the U.S. Supreme Court has required in \nthat area, and if they haven't provided guidance, follow what your Court of Appeals has required in that particular \narea.  And I can assure you that's exactly what I would do as a lower court judge.\n\nI would respectfully disagree with your comments, and I\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: We should have an open and fair debate here, not just go through the motions and, as Senator Leahy \nsaid, rubber stamp whoever the administration puts forward.  I won't characterize interest groups the way my good \nfriend, the chairman, does, but it seems that almost any time someone disagrees with what the nominee thinks, \nthere are certain editorial pages, certain groups that say, \"Oh, they have an agenda.\" I mean, we should have an \nopen discussion here.  That's the whole point of advise and consent, not simply to find out if someone's of good \nmoral character.\n\nSUTTON: And I appreciate the opportunity to have the honor of having this discussion with the committee and with \nyou directly.  And I know you've been an impassioned speaker on these federalism decisions in critiquing them, and \nI do want to turn to those.\n\nBut before I do that, the one -- I guess I could fairly call it a premise of your question -- was that one can line up a \nseries of cases, take five or six controversial cases, and say, \"Oh, anyone that could have advocated those \npositions must have a viewpoint that is just inconsistent with anything I think is good and right about what federal \njudges do and about what the Constitution means,\" and I respectfully disagree that that can fairly be said about me.\n\nI think there are many cases, representations I've handled, that I think you would applaud, and if you wouldn't \napplaud, would at least respect my role as a lawyer.  And I hope, in thinking about the federalism decisions, you will \nkeep in mind cases I did before I worked for the state, whether it's writing a brief for the Senate for the prevention of \nhandgun violence in the Sixth Circuit, as in the amicus brief, whether it's defending Ohio's hate crime statute on \nbehalf of several branches of the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, and every other civil rights group \naffected by that law in Ohio, or whether it's the work I did as state solicitor.\n\nKeep in mind, while the states have done unfortunate things at times in our history, the states today are doing some \ngood things.  At Ohio, I twice defended Ohio's set-aside statute.  I was, I think one can fairly say, very passionately \ninvolved in defending Cheryl Fisher in trying to get into Case Western Reserve with her disability of blindness.\n\nSince leaving the solicitor's office, while in private practice, I've continued to handle those kinds of representations.  \nI sought out and was hired to represent an indigent inmate in a civil rights case in the U.S. Supreme Court.  That's \none of the U.S. Supreme Court cases I did.\n\nIn terms of Sandoval, I've been on the other side of Sandoval. I've done a case involving implied right of actions on \nbehalf of Indian tribes for the National Congress of American Indians, and I was approached by them and hired by \nthem to handle that case.  That case is the mirror image of Sandoval.  I've handled two death penalty cases which, \nof course, are about as much against states as one can ever be.\n\nNow, when it comes to your perspective that when I've spoken to the press in the articles you referred to or when \nI've written articles\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: You don't express the sentiments of the people you represented in some of those cases in your private \narticles, only the ones on the other side.\n\nSUTTON: I don't think that's true.  If you look at\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Well, you can submit to the record\u2026\n\nSUTTON: Justice -- the tribute I did to Justice Powell -- your second criterion, looking for moderates -- I mean, if \nJustice Powell is not a moderate, then maybe I am wrong, and maybe I'm not qualified. But I do think he was a \nmoderate justice.  He hired me.  I wouldn't be sitting here but for Justice Powell hiring me back in whenever it was, \n1989, 1990.  And I think my tribute to him, you know, suggests that very point.\n\n\n\nI wrote another article for the Federalist Society in the Curious Joel (ph) decision criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court \nmajority for not allowing the Satmar Hesedam (ph) to develop a district -- why did they want to develop that district? \nPrecisely so handicapped citizens in that district could go to their own school and not have to go to the local public \nschool, which was the only way they could get disability services.  People that were not disabled in that district went \nto private Hassidic schools.  So I think\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Well, let me say this, sir.  Just with the Sandoval case -- you could do 10,000 pro bono cases for \nindividuals, and the Sandoval case takes away rights of individuals to pursue the rights you were pursuing in those \npro bono cases in one fell swoop.  And I don't think some cases where you were pro bono undoes what Sandoval \ndid.  I mean, you're saying treat each case equally.  I can't.\n\nSUTTON: I perfectly understand that point\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Sandoval took away rights of lots of individuals to be able to sue for just the things you were \nrepresenting the pro bono individuals to be able to do, right?\n\nSUTTON: Sandoval, keep in mind, is a case -- I've never written about it, never spoken about it.  That's a case \nwhere the client position of the state in that case was developed long before I was involved.  The constitutional -- \nwell, it wasn't a constitutional case -- the statutory interpretation argument was developed long before I was \ninvolved.\n\nWhen I was hired by that state to handle the case in the U.S. Supreme Court, as a lawyer upholding my oath to \nrepresent my client as best I possible can, I had an obligation to make those arguments. But, of course, Sandoval is \na statutory case.  That can be corrected by this body tomorrow.  I was simply representing them, and I would point \nout the Navajo case, where I represented these American Indian tribes, is the mirror image.  It's an implied right of \naction case, and those briefs, I think, show anything but hostility to implied rights of action.\n\nAs a judge -- the reason I want to be a judge, Senator, is precisely so my client is a different client.  The client is the \nrule of law, and that's the great honor of it.\n\nSCHUMER: But your view of what the rule of law is based on these quotes is far different than what most American \njudges, lawyers, students of juris prudence believe it is.\n\nSUTTON: Well, if I could respond to that, the question was -- a similar question was asked earlier this morning.  \nAnd the quote simply indicates that, of course, I believe in federalism as a principle. Federalism is a principle Court \nof Appeals judges have to follow in the same way they have to follow stereopsisis (ph).  The problem where people \ndisagree, quite reasonably, is the application of that principle in given cases.\n\nSCHUMER: Right.  Well, let's talk about one given case.  I understand your point.  I want to talk about Burney (ph), \nthe City of Burney (ph).  In that one, as you know, the Supreme Court held 5-4 that Congress had exceeded its \npower under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, when it passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nHATCH: Senator Schumer, you're five minutes over your time, but you can continue a reasonable\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Let me just ask this one, and then I'll ask for a second round\u2026\n\nHATCH: Sure.\n\nSCHUMER: \u2026 because I have a bunch, and I very much appreciate that, Senator, and I'll try to sum it up quickly.\n\nAnyway, you filed an amicus brief on behalf of the State of Ohio, and you argued the case in the Supreme Court. In \nthat brief, you pushed an argument that went even further than the five justice majority on the court was willing to \ngo.  You argued that Congress has no power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enact any law to enforce \nreligious freedom, free speech, or any other provision of the Bill of Rights. That strikes me as a pretty radical \nargument.\n\n\n\nNow, I understand you've been saying today you were just representing the State of Ohio, where my good friend is \nfrom.  First, it is true, of course, that many other states -- it's not inexorably that that's what Ohio had to believe -- \nother states, including my state of New York, came to the opposite conclusion that you came to and they filed an \namicus brief on the other side.  So it was hardly a neutral interpretation of law that all states would agree with here. \nIt's not so cut and dried, and it's not so obvious where the states' interest should be.\n\nBut what I'm wondering here is who decided it was in Ohio's interest to advance such a radical proposition?  Did the \ngovernor direct you to file the brief and go that far?  Did the attorney general?  Or did you decide to go on your own \nto take that extra step that no law could be passed in this regard?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, Senator, I think there's a -- I may be miscomprehending your question, but I'm pretty sure I'm\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: I'm asking you did the governor or the attorney general say, \"Make the argument that we should go \nfurther,\" or was that your argument?\n\nSUTTON: No one made the argument.  That's the false premise. The argument you're referring to was made by the \nparty, by the City of Burney (ph), represented by another lawyer.  This is quite critical, because\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: You didn't argue in that case that the Congress has no power under Section 5 to enact any law to \nenforce religious freedom?\n\nSUTTON: In the oral argument itself, Justice Scalia asked me the very question you're raising, because he noted \nthat the city had said Section 5 of the 14th Amendment only allows Congress to correct equal protection rights and \nprincipally about race and voting.  We did not make that affirmative argument in our brief.\n\nDuring the oral argument, I went second, after the City of Burney (ph) lawyer.  I specifically got up and said, \"That is \nwhere we disagree with the party. Section 5 by its terms covers everything in Section 1, and Section 1 includes the \ndue process clause.  The due process clause includes by incorporation free speech, free exercise of religion, all of \nthese Bill of Rights provisions that have been incorporated.\" Justice Scalia looked at me incredulously saying, \n\"That can't be right.\" And we said, \"No.  By its terms, Section 5 covers all of these rights.\"\n\nSUTTON: So we not only didn't make that argument, but we argued exactly the opposite, that there was such a \npower.  The question\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: That was in the brief?  I haven't seen the oral argument, but the brief didn't say what you're saying to \nme now, did it?\n\nSUTTON: Exactly.  It didn't -- we didn't take a position on it, and during the oral argument -- we were an amicus.  \nDuring the oral argument, I specifically contradicted this point, even though the party on our side of the case\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: But here's what I want to ask you.  Did you -- when you filed this brief, was it on direction from the \nattorney general or from the governor or one of the elected officials?  I don't know if the attorney general is elected \nin Ohio.\n\n(UNKNOWN): He is, or she is.\n\nSCHUMER: Did they tell you to make this argument, or did you come up with it?  Just answer that yes or no, if you \ncould.\n\nSUTTON: The attorney general decides what arguments to make, and the attorney general had the final decision \non whether that brief could be filed\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Did you suggest to him that the brief be filed the way it was before he said fine?  Who came up with\u2026\n\nSUTTON: She -- Montgomery.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: Excuse me.  Who came up with the idea to file the brief, the amicus brief, and -- however far -- we can \ndispute how far it goes.  But who came up with that idea?  Was it their idea, and you just followed what they said, or \ndid you come up with the idea and suggest it to them?\n\nSUTTON: Neither of us, Senator.\n\nSCHUMER: Well, tell me how it came about.\n\nSUTTON: What happened was\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: It wasn't spontaneous generation.  We\u2026\n\nHATCH: Senator, why don't you give him a chance to answer?\n\nSCHUMER: I will.\n\nHATCH: You're 10 minutes over already.\n\nSUTTON: Senator, what happened in the case was Ohio, like many other states, after RFRA was passed, had \nmany lawsuits filed against them by prison inmates claiming that under RFRA, they could have accommodations -- \nand it led to lots of litigation, some of which, I think you would agree, is somewhat frivolous -- but lots of inmate \nlitigation.\n\nThere's a corrections section of the AG's office -- I was not involved in this decision, so I don't know if it was the \ncorrection official or Attorney General Montgomery -- I suspect Attorney General Montgomery would have been \ninvolved -- they decided in those cases to raise the defense that RFRA could not be used to bring these prisoner \nclaims because it exceeded Congress' power.  I was not involved in that decision.  When the City of Burney (ph) \ncase made its way to the courts, by that time, the office and the state -- the correction officers of the state -- had an \ninterest in this litigation, and that's exactly what happened.\n\nSCHUMER: I can come back to this if I'm taking too much time.  I just want to go over -- I have the brief here, and I \nwanted to go over a few of the points here.  But I'll wait.\n\nHATCH: No, if it's on the same line of questioning, and you want to continue, go right ahead.\n\nSCHUMER: OK.  So here is the brief that you filed.  This is the brief for the amici states of Ohio and the others, and \nit says, \"Betty Montgomery, attorney general of Ohio; Jeffrey S. Sutton, state solicitor, counsel.\" And this is on page \n-- well, this is Westlaw, so I don't have the page.  But it says, \"Point Number 1-B. The debates over the 14th \nAmendment confirm that the words mean what they say. When Congress had an opportunity to adapt a broader \nversion of Section 5, which was offered in February, 1866, it rejected the proposal.  To the amici states' knowledge, \nmoreover, no participant in the debates embraced the interpretation of the 14th Amendment offered here, namely, \nthat Section 1 incorporates most of the first eight amendments, and that Section 5 allows Congress to enforce both \nthe meaning of the amendments and any values underlying them.\"\n\nSUTTON: That's exactly correct, Senator, and the reason it's correct is the \"and.\" The \"and\" point we were making \nin the brief was that no one in the Congress at that point in proposing the 14th Amendment said simultaneously that \nCongress would have the final say over what the U.S. Constitution means, which is to say overrule Marbury v. \nMadison, and simultaneously say anything covered in Section 1, even incorporated rights in the other Bill of \nRights, would be included.\n\nSCHUMER: But what you say here would exactly buttress -- I mean, I'll let you have the last word here -- exactly \nwhat I said, that there could be no -- it's not just some -- this is broad and sweeping, even with your \"and\" argument \n-- that Congress would have no power under Section 5 to enact any law to enforce religious freedom.  Isn't that \ncorrect?\n\n\n\nSUTTON: With all respect, Senator, I couldn't disagree more, and I think it would have been poor advocacy to say \nnothing was wrong to make that argument.  But the proof is not only the \"and\" that I referred to, but the proof is to \nread -- is the transcript.  The transcript doesn't indicate who the justice is.  It's Justice Scalia. This was the exact \npoint I made.  I was challenged very hard by him on it, and I pushed back on it, and we won on that issue, on an \nissue I think you applaud, based on your questions.  We won on that point. That's good.\n\nSCHUMER: Well, I'm going to come back to it.  I'm going to go read the brief -- I mean, the oral argument, and we'll \ncome back to it.\n\nWe will have a second round, I presume, Mr. Chairman.  Is that correct?\n\nHATCH: Sure.\n\nSCHUMER: Thank you.  I appreciate the committee -- that I went on for a while.\n\nHATCH: I would at this point ask unanimous consent that an article written by Jeffrey S. Sutton entitled \"Justice \nPowell's Path We're Following\" that appeared in the Columbus Dispatch be submitted for the record and made a \npart of the record.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We have no objection.\n\nHATCH: Without objection.\n\nAt this point, Senator Cornyn -- yes?\n\n(UNKNOWN): I would just ask unanimous consent -- there are a whole bunch of letters of opposition to the \nnominee's\u2026\n\nHATCH: They can be made a part of the record, absolutely.\n\n(UNKNOWN): \u2026 and I'd ask that they be made a part of the record.  Thank you.\n\nCORNYN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm honored to be sitting here today.  This is my first hearing where the \npresident's judicial nominees have come before the committee and put their qualifications up for evaluation by the \nSenate in its constitutional role of advice and consent.\n\nSince I'm a new member of the committee, perhaps you'll indulge me for a moment just to talk a second about the \ntiming, the unfortunate timing sequence since the president first nominated these two men and Justice Cook.  It was \nMay, 2001, that the president first proposed these judicial nominees, and yes, it has been an inordinate amount of \ntime leading up to today's hearing before they've had an opportunity to defend themselves and to present their \nrecord and to answer questions this committee has about their qualifications to serve in the important positions to \nwhich the president has chosen them.\n\nI know that during the opening statements, there were statements made by Senator Leahy about the past.  And I \nwant to tell Senator Leahy and those on the other side of the aisle on the committee that I -- as a new member of \nthe committee, you'll perhaps allow me to say that I hope that the committee can have a fresh start.\n\nI don't think it serves the interest of the American people for us to point the finger across the aisle and say because \nRepublicans did not act on a timely basis on appointees of President Clinton that perhaps the same ought to be \ndone in retribution when there is a Republican in the White House and when Democrats are in the majority. While I \nhave reservations under the separation of powers provision of our Constitution about the president's proposal for a \ntime table -- I don't believe that should be imposed -- indeed, it can't be imposed by the executive branch on the \nlegislative branch.\n\nBut I do think that it would be worthwhile for this committee to consider on a bipartisan basis trying to come up with \nsome rule that would guide the committee in terms of the manner in which we consider the president's nominees, \n\n\n\nregardless of who happens to be in power, a Republican president or a Democratic president, so that we can have \na timely consideration of these nominees' qualifications and an up or down vote by the members of this committee, \nand then, if it passes out of this committee, by the entire Senate.\n\nI think we not only owe the men and women who are appointed, or nominated, excuse me, by the president the \ncourtesy of that, but I believe we owe the American people and the people we serve that same thing, because, in \nfact, of course, for all of the vacancies that have existed as a result of the failure to act on the president's judicial \nnominees, there are very real human beings whose cases are not being heard in our courts.  And, of course, as we \nall know, justice delayed is justice denied.\n\nSo I just want to say here in my maiden voyage on this committee that I would hope that we would try to work in a \nbipartisan way toward a fresh start and a time table that would allow timely consideration of all the president's \nnominees.  No one's going to say a senator has to vote one way or another.  That's our prerogative as members of \nthe Senate, and we will, indeed, be held accountable to our constituencies who sent us here.\n\nBut I think that the president is entitled to his choices, subject to an up or down vote by the Senate, and that should \nbe done on a timely basis.\n\nLEAHY: If the senator would yield without losing any of his time on this -- he mentioned me\u2026\n\nCORNYN: I'd be glad to turn it over to you in a minute, but if you'd let me -- I've waited a long time to have my spot, \nso if you'll give me a chance just to say a couple of things, I'll then be glad to turn it over.\n\nI also come to this job representing the state of Texas in the United States Senate with the background of having \nserved in virtually all three branches of government, as a judge, as a member of the executive branch as attorney \ngeneral, and now in the legislative branch, albeit on the federal level.  And, of course, I think a lot of the debate that \nwe're hearing today has to do with what is the appropriate role of not only the legislative branch versus the judicial \nbranch, but, indeed, what is the proper role of a lawyer in our adversary system, and whether the positions that a \nlawyer advocates on behalf of a client are somehow attributable to the personal beliefs and convictions of that \nlawyer when they argue a point of law, which they're obligated to do under the code of conduct, which they may or \nmay not agree with but which they're duty bound to propose to the court and let the court make that decision.\n\nAnd so I think the debate we're having today, in many ways, is nothing new.  It's a debate on the subject matter \ntouched upon by the founding fathers, including, of course, Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Number 78, when he \ntalked about the different roles of the branches of government.\n\nSo what I would like to maybe ask -- and I just have very few questions for Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts and Mr. \nSutton -- is, first of all, Mr. Roberts, I wonder if you would please address the obligation of a lawyer, ethical \nobligation, to advance a legal argument on behalf of a client, even though a court may ultimately disagree with you \nor agree with you.  What is the lawyer's obligation as you understand it under the code of legal responsibility?\n\nROBERTS: Well, I think the standard phrase is zealous advocacy on behalf of a client.  You don't make any \nconceivable argument.  The argument has to have a reasonable basis in law, but it certainly doesn't have to be a \nwinner.  I've lost enough cases that I would hate to be held to that standard.\n\nBut if it's an argument that has a reasonable basis in the law, including arguments concerning the extension of \nprecedent and the reversal of precedent -- I think Chairman Hatch quoted the pertinent standard from the American \nBar Association -- the lawyer is ethically bound to present that argument on behalf of the client.  And there is a \nlongstanding tradition in our country -- dating back to one of the more famous episodes, of course, which was John \nAdams' representation of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre -- that the positions a lawyer presents \non behalf of a client should not be ascribed to that lawyer as his personal beliefs or his personal positions.\n\nCORNYN: And, Justice Cook, if you do have a -- as a judge, of course, your responsibilities are different under our \nadversary system from those of an advocate like Mr. Roberts or Mr. Sutton.  What do you do as a judge when you \n\n\n\nmay have personal feelings about an argument, but where the legislature had spoken, or where there is precedent \nby a higher court on that very point?  How do you address that as a judge?\n\nCOOK: One of the more important things for a judge to have in mind is the importance of -- or to note the humility of \nfunction that is really asked of a judge.  Judges need to exercise restraint and to put aside any personal convictions \nor preferences.\n\nThe essential democracy of judging is that the judge will be above the fray, that the judge will consider the cases \nimpartially and certainly objectively and conscientiously.  And that's the method that I've employed as a judge for \nthe past dozen years, and I know that to be the fairest way to judge.\n\nCORNYN: Justice Cook, have you ever made a legal decision in your capacity as a member of an appellate court \nor the Ohio Supreme Court that you knew was going to be politically unpopular?\n\nCOOK: Oh, yes, I have.\n\nCORNYN: And how do you address that in terms of what you view to be your obligation as a judge?\n\nCOOK: It's absolutely -- you know, sometimes it's hard to swallow, but it certainly is not one of my concerns that \ndrives my function, my work.  It's -- as we say, it goes with the territory, and sometimes you're called upon in doing \nyour best work and in your faithful application of the law -- it will produce what could be, or what would be viewed \nas an unpopular result, and certainly that's just a part of your duties.\n\nCORNYN: Well, having been in a similar position to you when I served as a member of the Texas Supreme Court, \ndo you hope that the people evaluating your performance, whether you're an elected judge or an appointed judge, \nwill understand that your judgment as a member of a court is not an expression of political opinion?\n\nCOOK: That's the whole -- some of the criticism that I have seen launched with regard to this nomination process \nseems to be that very thing to which you refer, Senator.  It's a result oriented view of cases, which I hope would not \nbe any indication of my qualifications as a jurist.\n\nCORNYN: And how do you feel about result oriented decision making by a judge?\n\nCOOK: Oh, I very much -- I would never -- I don't participate in it, and I suppose we see it happen, but it's an \naffront, really, to democracy and to the oath that we take.  To judge cases without regard to persons is the oath we \ntake in Ohio, to administer justice without regard to persons, and, therefore, I would see it as an affront to that oath \nto look at the results.\n\nCORNYN: Mr. Sutton, during some of the questioning, I think you alluded to the notion that if a court made a \ndecision on a statutory basis, perhaps applying a statute in a particular way or that the legislature disagreed with, \nthat the legislature would have an opportunity to come back and correct that error.  I've read scholars talking about \nthat process between the legislature and the judicial branch as a conversation between branches of government.  I \nwonder if you would tell me your thoughts on that.\n\nSUTTON: Well, that's very well put, Senator. I'm not sure I could put it any better, but I think you are right.  On \nstatutory interpretation cases, particularly very important federal statutes that reach the U.S. Supreme Court, there \nis an ongoing dialog between one side of the street and the other -- across this very street is the U.S. Supreme \nCourt -- and I think that's appropriate.\n\nYou know, sometimes courts do get it wrong.  Sometimes courts aren't -- they don't figure out exactly what \nCongress had in mind or exactly what it wanted, and, happily, the way this process works is that Congress can \ncome back the very next day and get it right. Usually, the U.S. Supreme Court does get it right and you don't need \nthat, but that is an answer in all situations involving statutory interpretation cases.\n\n\n\nCORNYN: I know that during the course of this hearing and in press accounts that I've read about the qualifications \nand credentials of each of the three of you that there's been a suggestion made that each of you have somehow \nparticipated in decision making or advocacy, as the case may be, outside the judicial mainstream.\n\nMr. Sutton, have you ever argued a case that you've lost?\n\nSUTTON: Unfortunately, all too often, yes.\n\nCORNYN: Have you won more than you've lost?\n\nSUTTON: At the U.S. Supreme Court, I have been fortunate.  I have a 9 and 3 record there.  But even then, I would \necho what Mr. Roberts said earlier, that while the lawyer's duty, ethically, is to make every reasonable argument to \nadvance your client's cause, sometimes that doesn't work, and there's nothing you can do about that.\n\nCORNYN: Well, on those occasions when you've made an argument to the United States Supreme Court and \nyou've lost, have you concluded that your argument was outside of the legal mainstream? Is that the necessary \nconclusion that you would draw?\n\nSUTTON: My first reaction is usually that they're the ones outside the mainstream, but, happily, that lasts about an \nhour, and I realize that their job is to figure out what the right decision is here.  And no, I don't reach that \nconclusion, and I don't think it's the right one.  I think it's a very dangerous one to the bar, because there are a lot \nof clients, particularly criminal defendants, who need lawyers to really push hard on their behalf.\n\nThe system doesn't work if you don't have an adversarial process that is effective.  And I do think it would be quite \nhurtful to think that a member of a bar, in advocating a case, whether on behalf of a state or a criminal defendant, \ncould be told that if they lost that case or if an argument that they made wasn't successful, they'd have to hear \nabout it if they ever tried to become a judge.  That strikes me as very dangerous.\n\nCORNYN: Mr. Roberts, if you have made an argument that someone might characterize as outside of the \nmainstream of the law, but let's say the United States Supreme Court happens to agree with you, and you win that \ncase, would you consider those to -- that you were outside the mainstream in making the argument, but the fact that \nthe Supreme Court agreed with you -- what conclusion would you draw about whether that is outside the legal \nmainstream of American jurisprudence?\n\nROBERTS: Well, I would say that it is not.  I mean, if you're making an argument before the Supreme Court and \nyou prevail, you should be criticized if you, for whatever reason, declined to make that argument.  That's not to say \nthat the Supreme Court is above criticism, and it's certainly appropriate and healthy to scrutinize and, when \nappropriate, to criticize the Supreme Court's decisions.\n\nBut I don't think it's appropriate to criticize a lawyer for making an argument that the Supreme Court accepts. That's \nthe lawyer's job, and he wouldn't be doing his job if he hadn't made that argument.\n\nCORNYN: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Roberts, and I'll ask the same question of Mr. Sutton, because you are not \njudges\u2026\n\nHATCH: Senator, last question.\n\nCORNYN: You are not judges now, but advocates under this adversary system we've been discussing.  Are you \nwilling to commit to assuming a new role and a different role, and that is as an impartial umpire of the law, legal \narguments, and leave your role as an advocate behind where you represented one particular view or another, but \nnow to take on that disinterested impartial adjudicatory role?\n\nROBERTS: Yes, I am, Senator. There's no role for advocacy with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of \na judge.  The judge is bound to follow the Supreme Court precedent, whether he agrees with it or disagrees with it, \nand bound to apply the rule of law in cases, whether there's applicable Supreme Court precedent or not. Personal \nviews, personal ideology -- those have no role to play whatever.\n\n\n\nCORNYN: Mr. Sutton?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, Senator.  You know, where one stands on an issue often depends on where one sits, and if one is \nfortunate enough to be confirmed to be an Article 3 judge, you sit in a position where the whole reason for being is \nto be fair, open minded, do everything you can to make sure you appreciate every perspective that is brought \nbefore you, whether it is an amicus brief or a party argument, and look for guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court if \nnot controlling guidance, look for guidance from your circuit, and do your best to get it right.\n\nCORNYN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Senator Leahy wants a point of personal privilege here.\n\nLEAHY: Just following our usual practice, once I've been mentioned by another senator\u2026\n\nHATCH: Go ahead.\n\nLEAHY: \u2026 and I realize he did not want to yield for a response at that time.  I would note, one, I absolutely agree \nthat these -- the judges should be moved as rapidly as possible, and that is why in the 17 months that I was \nchairman, we moved more of President Bush's judges than the Republicans had in 30 months with President \nClinton's. That was 100 judges.\n\nI mention that number because even members of your party, both in the Senate and at the White House, keep \nreferring to it as being 20 or 25.  They're probably not aware -- and I'm sure the president wouldn't intentionally \nmislead the public, but his staff probably gave him the wrong numbers.  It was 100.\n\nI also note that these three nominees -- the Republicans were in charge of the Senate for a number of weeks after \nthey were nominated. They did not call a hearing on them.\n\nHATCH: Senator Kohl?\n\nCORNYN: Mr. Chairman, may I just briefly respond?  I just want to make clear to Senator Leahy I meant certainly \nno disrespect or intent to\u2026\n\nLEAHY: None taken.\n\nCORNYN: \u2026 to somehow mischaracterize the record.  All I was saying is that I hope the committee would look \nforward rather than backward, because I don't view that as being conducive to doing the job that I feel like we are \nelected to do, and that is to move these nominees on a timely basis in fairness to them and in fairness to the people \nwe represent.  And so I would hope that, together, working across the aisle, we could perhaps come up with some \nkind of framework that would eliminate the need for the sort of finger pointing and recriminations that I think are \nunfortunate, because I don't think anyone is without blame.  That is my only point, and I hope I've made it clearly.\n\nLEAHY: I felt no disrespect, and the senator from Texas has a distinguished record in public service and in all the \nbranches, and I'd be more than happy to work with him on just the thing we both agree with.\n\nHATCH: Senator Kohl?\n\nKOHL: Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today.  A vital element of our constitutional duty to \nadvise and consent to judicial nominees, nominees who, once confirmed, will serve lifetime appointments, is an \nopportunity to examine their records, their outlook, and judicial philosophies at these confirmation hearings.\n\nThese hearings, as you know, are our only opportunity to evaluate a nominee's qualifications before casting our \nfinal vote.  If confirmed, these hearings are likely to be the last time any of these individuals ever speak in a public \nforum regarding their views before assuming their lifetime appointments to positions that may effect the liberties and \nconstitutional rights of every American.\n\n\n\nSo I'm somewhat disappointed that the majority has scheduled today's hearings with three appellate court \nnominees.  To conduct confirmation hearings in such a manner is contrary, I believe, to the interest of giving \nsenators, as well as the American people, a fair opportunity to examine and evaluate the qualifications, credentials, \nand judicial temperaments of these nominees.  I believe it's difficult to fulfill our obligations to carefully consider the \nmerits of these nominees in a hearing that is somewhat crowded.\n\nI have several questions.  The first is for you, Mr. Sutton. Throughout our nation's history, citizens have relied on \nour federal courts to protect their civil liberties and constitutional rights against the actions of states and local \ngovernments in cases involving everything from employment discrimination, school desegregation, and free \nspeech.\n\nHowever, you've spent much of your career arguing that individuals have no right to see redress in federal court for \ncivil rights violations committed by state and local governments under the doctrine of federalism.  Then why \nshouldn't we be concerned that your interpretation of federalism will seriously harm the ability of ordinary citizens \nseeking relief against violation of their civil and constitutional rights in your court should you be confirmed?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, Senator.  Thanks for an opportunity to address that.  When I became involved in what we'll call \nfederalism cases or cases representing states, I did that starting in 1995 when I was appointed to be the state \nsolicitor of Ohio and was honored to have that job for three and a half years, And I did what all state assistant AGs \nor state solicitors do and did my best, as a lawyer, an advocate on behalf of the state, to defend the state in \nlitigation.\n\nSUTTON.  As lawyers, obviously we weren't involved in the underlying policy decisions that led to the litigation.  It \nwas just our job and my job at the appellate court to defend the state's position.\n\nIt is true during that time I did get involved in the City of Boerne case, which is a federalism case.  And I did work on \nbehalf of the states during that period of time.  But it's well to note that Ohio, like many other states, has passed a \nlot of laws that are very protective of civil liberty and I was active in those cases.\n\nI helped defend Ohio's set-aside statute from equal protection challenges twice.  The only case I had while I was \nworking in that office, the only case I can ever remember where I had an opportunity to represent either side, was \nthe Cheryl Fischer case involving a blind woman who had been denied admission to medical school.  And I picked \nher side of the case to work on.\n\nSo I think the notion that because I've represented states, either the State of Ohio or other states, in cases where \nan individual disagreed with something a state was doing shows some bias, I guess I respectfully disagree with, \none, because I was representing my client as best I could.\n\nBut, two, even if one were to assess a nominee based on their advocacy and the clients' positions they \nrepresented, there are many of them that are on the other side of these issues that I think you'd be very comfortable \nwith and would have encouraged me.\n\nSo I do think that is an answer to the criticism that if confirmed I wouldn't be able to judge these things fair.  I think \nit's just the opposite.  I would look at what the U.S. Supreme Court has done.  I'd follow it carefully.  I'd look at Sixth \nCircuit precedent, and if it's binding, we'd obviously follow that.\n\nKOHL: Mr. Sutton, how do you respond to those who argue that your record in private practice demonstrates \ncertain hostility to the civil rights of people who are disabled?\n\nSUTTON: Well, most of the representations I've done involving, let's say, civil rights on the pro-civil rights part of \nthe equation were in private practice.  And I defended Ohio's hate crime statute through an amicus brief on a pro \nbono effort on behalf of the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and several other civil rights groups affected by \nhate crime legislation.  We were successful in upholding that.\n\nI represented the Center for the Prevention of Handgun Violence in defending against the constitutional challenge a \nColumbus assault weapon ordinance, which was preventing assault weapons in the Columbus region.\n\n\n\nSince being state solicitor, I've continued. I've represented a prisoner inmate in a civil rights case at the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I've defended two death penalty inmates.\n\nAnd I'm a member of the Equal Justice Foundation.  I was asked to be a member of that foundation before I was \nnominated.  And the purpose of the Equal Justice Foundation, which of course was a pro bono effort, is to provide \nlegal services to all manner of indigent claimants, first and foremost the disabled, but those based on race and \nmany others.\n\nAnd that group has done a lot of very good things in Ohio. They've led the effort to, you know, put curbside ramps \nin Ohio cities successfully under the ADA.\n\nSo I do understand the question.  And I understand why someone could look at the Garrett case or the Kimel case \nand say, \"Boy, you know, how could someone take that case?\" And my answer, to the extent there's a sin here, it's \nthat I really wanted to develop a U.S. Supreme Court practice.  And I was very eager to do so.  And it was easier to \nget those cases on that side, having worked for the state before I went back to private practice.\n\nBut it didn't reflect any bias at all.  In fact, it's quite the opposite.\n\nKOHL: I appreciate that answer.  I'm not as fully convinced as you would wish me to be with respect to your \npredilection.  But clearly you are a trying to present your position as well as you can. And I do respect that.\n\nSUTTON: Thank you.\n\nKOHL: Mr. Sutton -- and I'd like to also ask opinions from the other two nominees -- in the past few years there's \nbeen a growth in the use of so-called protective orders in product liability cases.  We saw this, for example, in the \nsettlements arising from the Bridgestone/Firestone lawsuits.\n\nCritics say that those protective orders oftentimes prevent the public from learning about the health and safety \nhazards in the products that they use.  In fact, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina recently \npassed a local rule banning the use of sealed settlements altogether.\n\nSo I'd like to ask you, Mr. Sutton, and then the other two nominees, should a judge be required to balance the \npublic's right to know against a litigant's right to privacy when the information sought to be sealed could keep \nsecret a public health and safety hazard?\n\nAnd what would be your views regarding the new local rule of the District of South Carolina on this issue, which is, \nas I said, banning the use of sealed settlements altogether?\n\nMr. Sutton, you first.\n\nSUTTON: Yes, Senator, I have to confess this is not an area in which I've practiced.  And I can't think of a case \nwhere I've actually had to deal with this issue.  So as a court of appeals judge, I would do what all court of appeals \njudges are obligated to do and look very carefully at U.S. Supreme Court precedent on these types of issues.\n\nI suspect you're right, that what U.S. Supreme Court precedent requires is exactly the balance you're talking about, \na balance between the public's right to know and the privacy rights of whatever that particular defendant might be.\n\nBut I can't say I know that for sure.  What I can tell you is that I would discern what that precedent requires.  I'd look \nat what Sixth Circuit precedent requires.  I'd look very carefully and open- mindedly at the argument of either party \non this kind of issue -- and I certainly appreciate the perspective you have on it -- and do my best, having done all \nthat, to decide it correctly.\n\nKOHL: Well, you're aware of some of these secret settlements that have in effect prevented vital information from \nbeing passed on to people still using defective products who are unaware of that because a secret settlement was \nmade in a court.  You're aware that these things have happened.\n\n\n\nSUTTON: Not that aware, I have to tell you.\n\nKOHL: Really?  You don't know that at all?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I'm just saying I haven't worked in one of these areas.  I understand what you're saying.  I've read \nnews reports along those lines.\n\nKOHL: Right.\n\nSUTTON: But I'm just making the point it's not something I know very much about at all.  In fact it's the opposite.  I \nknow very little about it legally.  And as a court of appeals judge\u2026\n\nKOHL: It's such an important issue, without trying to be unduly difficult with you, that it would seem to me you would \nhave a pretty strong opinion on it.  But I appreciate that.\n\nMr. Roberts, how do you feel about the validity of maintaining or throwing out secret settlements that are made \nwhich prevent other people who may be using these defective products from knowing that they are defective, like \ndefective tires, for example, defective medical devices, for example?\n\nROBERTS: It's not an area that I have litigated in either.  I certainly am aware of the cases as they've come up.  \nAlthough I don't think it's an issue that the D.C. Circuit has addressed.  At least I'm not aware that it's done so.\n\nAnd I hesitate to opine on it without having studied the law.  I certainly would obviously follow the Supreme Court \nprecedent and the precedent of the circuit if I were to be confirmed.\n\nI suspect that you're correct that the applicable law would involve some balancing.  There are some interests in \nsealing settlement in some cases.  But I'd be very surprised if that required or permitted sealing in a case where \nthat actively concealed a harmful condition on an ongoing basis that was continuing to present a danger.\n\nBut again, I'm just surmising at this point. And as a judge I would apply the law in the circuit or in the Supreme \nCourt.\n\nKOHL: OK.\n\nMs. Cook?\n\nCOOK: I agree with Messrs. Sutton and Robertson (sic), of course balancing judges do.  Balancing is one of our \nregularly engaged-in endeavors.  So this certainly sounds -- the issue would demand balancing if there is danger \nand harm to others, potential danger, in the absence of disclosure.  I understand that balancing would be important.\n\nKOHL: I asked the question because there have been over the years and recent years cases where judges have \napproved these kinds of settlements between a company and a litigant.  And that precluded in many cases \nthousands and thousands of people who were using defective products from knowing that these products were \ndefective.\n\nNow, in this simplistic kind of a presentation that I'm trying to put before you, which is fairly black and white, while \nI'm not sure whether you're going to answer, I would hope as a judge -- I would hope -- that you would not allow any \nsettlement that endangered the health and safety of the users of products to be made simply to benefit a \ncorporation who wanted to keep that knowledge from the users of that defective product.\n\nWhere you'll come out on these issues in the event you're confirmed I don't know.  But obviously you know where \nI'm coming from. And I think you know where most Americans would be coming from.\n\nLast question.  One of my priorities on this committee is my role on the Antitrust Subcommittee.  Strong antitrust \nenforcement is essential to ensuring that competition flourishes throughout our country, which benefits consumers \nthrough lower prices and better quality products and services.\n\n\n\nFederal courts are essential to the firm enforcement of our antitrust laws and to ensuring that anticompetitive \nconduct is sanctioned.\n\nMany antitrust questions are decided under what is known as the rule of reason, in which the harm caused by the \nbusiness conduct at issue is balanced against full competitive justifications.  This doctrine gives a great deal of \ndiscretion to the courts to determine whether or not the antitrust laws have been violated.\n\nWhat would be your approach to deciding antitrust issues under the rule of reason?  More generally, please give us \nyour views regarding the role of the judiciary with respect to the enforcement of antitrust law.\n\nMr. Sutton?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, Senator, this too is an area where I have not had an active litigation practice.  In fact, just sitting \nhere I can't actually think of one case I've been involved in when I was working for the State of Ohio.  Ohio's one of \nthe states that sued Microsoft, so I have some familiarity with that case and some peripheral involvement with that \none.\n\nBut clearly, in terms of your question, the federal courts have a critical role in enforcing the antitrust acts and \nantitrust laws.  And that's what the U.S. Supreme Court has said.  And I can't imagine a court of appeals judge not \nfollowing the precedents to that exact effect.\n\nKOHL: Mr. Roberts?\n\nROBERTS: As a private lawyer, I have actually represented probably more plaintiff's and enforcement interests in \nantitrust actions than defendants.  I represented the state attorneys general in the Microsoft case.  I represented \nseveral private plaintiffs in antitrust appeals as well.  Handled some antitrust cases when I was in the solicitor \ngeneral's office.\n\nI've also represented corporations accused of antitrust violations.  And I think that balanced perspective is \nsomething that's valuable for a judge.  I certainly think a lawyer coming into court, if I were to be confirmed, \nrepresenting a plaintiff in an antitrust action should take some comfort in the fact that I've done that.  And a lawyer \nrepresenting a defendant should take some comfort in the fact that I've done that as well and I have the perspective \nof the issue from both sides.\n\nSo again, obviously as a judge I'd follow the binding Supreme Court precedent and the precedent in my circuit.  But \nI would hope that in doing so I would have some added perspective from having been on both sides, both the \nplaintiff's side and the defendant's side, in antitrust enforcement actions.\n\nKOHL: Thank you.\n\nAnd, Ms. Cook?\n\nCOOK: And as in all the issues that a judge must consider I think the importance would be the conscientious \nweighing and balancing and understanding the rule of reason within the confines of the existing law and that \ncertainly other decisions in that area would inform the decision that I might be called upon to make.  So I would \napply the structured, principled decisional process.\n\nKOHL: I thank you.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you, Senator.\n\nWe'll turn to Senator Sessions now.\n\nSenator Sessions, you're up.\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: I'd like to ask the three of you one question.  You've had great experience and you're lawyers of \nintegrity and ability.\n\nDo you believe that a conscientious judge can read the Constitution, read statutes, and prior case authority and \nrender and be able to interpret a statute?  Do you believe that you're capable of that?  I'd like to hear your answer to \nthat.\n\nSUTTON: Senator, you're looking at me, so I'll take that as a\u2026\n\nSESSIONS: (inaudible) yes.  We'll take you first.\n\nSUTTON: \u2026 I should start.  Yes, thank you.\n\nSESSIONS: You're smiling, I thought.\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely.  I do.  There's no doubt there are difficult cases. There are cases at the margin where text \ngets difficult to interpret.  But yes, I do think what lawyers do is at the end of the day what judges do, which is read \nconstitutions, read statutes to determine what the framers or that legislative body meant.  Those words have \nmeaning.  There are statutes, rules of construction that give guidance to the meaning of those words.  And judges \nhave an obligation to follow those rules and to follow the text of the statute or in some cases the text of the \nConstitution in cases before them.\n\nAnd happily, as a court of appeals judge, court of appeals judges have a lot of guidance from the U.S. Supreme \nCourt on those very things.  And a court of appeals judge would of course follow that.\n\nSESSIONS: Mr. Roberts, do you agree?\n\nROBERTS: Yes, I do.  In other words, I do think there is a right answer in a case.\n\nROBERTS: And I think if judges do the work and work hard at it, they're likely to come up with the right answer.\n\nI think that's why, for example, in the D.C. Circuit 97 percent of the panel decisions are unanimous, because they \nare hardworking judges and they come up with the same answer in a vast majority of the cases.\n\nThere's certainly going to be disagreements.  That's why we have courts of appeals, because we think district \ncourts are not always going to get it right.  But I do think that there is a right answer and, if the judge and lawyers \nwould just work hard enough, they'd come up with it.\n\nSESSIONS: Judge Cook, do you agree?\n\nCOOK: Yes, I do.  I think that judges search -- I think it's great when judges search for objectified meaning, that is, \nthe meaning that a reasonable person would gather from the text that a judge is called upon to interpret.\n\nAnd certainly I really think in good faith judges working conscientiously can come to different conclusions \nsometimes.  But I really think that there are objective boundaries within which most cases are really decided, within \nthose boundaries.\n\nSESSIONS: Well, I agree.  I spent 15 years in federal court every day as a federal prosecutor.  If I had a case that \nanswered the question, almost invariably the judge ruled that way.  If the law was against me, you could expect the \njudge to rule against me.\n\nBut we have a theory, a foot, in America, sort of a postmodernism illness, deconstructionism critical legal studies \nthat all law is politics and that you are being asked about your political views about matters.  And that's being \npromoted to a large degree, I think, by people who don't really understand that in every court in America all over \nthis country, day after day after day, judges are reading statutes and rendering sound rulings that never get \nappealed.  If they do, they get affirmed unanimously, as you mentioned.\n\n\n\nBecause I believe we can ascertain the plain meaning of words and can render consistent verdicts.  And to me \nthat's what justice is.\n\nAnd I am troubled by the idea that you'd be brought up and you'd be challenged on your personal political views, \nwhen I know you as professionals know that it makes no difference what your personal view is.  If the Supreme \nCourt has held otherwise or a statute is the other way or the Constitution is the other way, you'll follow that.\n\nAm I correct in that?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely, Senator.  I mean, that is the whole privilege of being a judge, that your client is the rule of \nlaw.  And the only way the rule of law has meaning is if judges determine the meaning of statutes and constitution \nbased first on what the words say and suggest and then based on other indicators of legislative or constitutional \nmeaning.  I agree with you.\n\nSESSIONS: Mr. Roberts?\n\nROBERTS: Yes, you know, if it all came down to just politics in the judicial branch, that would be very frustrating for \nlawyers who work very hard to try to advocate their position and present the precedents and present the argument.  \nThey expect the judges to work justified (ph).  And if the judge is going to rule one way or the other, regardless of \nthe arguments, well, he could save everybody a lot of work.  But the rule of law would suffer.\n\nAnd I know that's of particular concern in the D.C. Circuit.  I know one of the things that frustrates very much the \njudges who are on that court, all of whom are very hardworking, is when they announce a decision and they're \nidentified in the press as a Democratic appointee or a Republican appointee.\n\nThat makes such -- it gives so little credit to the work that they put into the case.  And they work very hard.  And all \nof a sudden the report is, well, they just decided that way because of politics. That is a disservice to them.\n\nAnd I know as an advocate I never liked it when I had a political judge, when I was in front of a political judge.  \nBecause, again, you put a lot of work into presenting the case and you want to see that same work returned.  And \nthe theory is that that will help everybody reach the right result.  And I think that's correct.\n\nSESSIONS: Ms. Cook?\n\nCOOK: Likewise.\n\nSenator, I can't tell you who's quote this is, but I ascribe to the view that this quote is, the rule of law should be a \nlaw of rules. And I think that's somewhat the view you take.  And certainly it is my experience that the cases are \ndecidable and usually are decided based on rules.\n\nSESSIONS: I just think that's so important.  And I think it's dangerous for us to say we're going to determine \npeople's ideology and then we're going to vote to confirm them or not.\n\nAnd to our friends in the disability movement, let me say to you, as I read these cases, they have nothing \nwhatsoever to do with the policy of providing protections for people with disabilities.  It's a matter of constitutional \nquestions such as sovereign immunity.\n\nI know that Senator Robert Byrd and other senators in our body defend tenaciously the prerogative of the United \nStates Senate.  And if a coequal branch does not defend its prerogatives, it will lose those privileges.\n\nAnd attorney generals are that way, aren't they, Mr. Sutton?  I know Attorney General Corning (ph) is here. But I \nwas attorney general, and I did not feel that I would have done my job if on my watch the legal prerogatives of the \nState of Alabama were eroded by my failure to defend those rights.\n\nAnd you've worked for the state attorney general's office.  Isn't that true of any attorney general?\n\n\n\nSUTTON: I think it's true not only for state attorney generals; it's true for the U.S. solicitor general and the U.S. \nattorney general, that just as if a state is sued in any case, their lawyers have an obligation to do their best to \nrepresent the client.  The lawyers aren't involved in the underlying policy decision that leads to the dispute that \nleads to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawyers come in once that dispute can't be resolved outside of court.  And at that point, whether it's a state AG \nor the United States solicitor general, you know, whether it's a claim of racial discrimination, disability discrimination, \nthose lawyers have in the past and do continue to represent the governmental body, which is publicly elected.\n\nAnd that's, I think, an honor for people who have had the chance to represent the people by working in an attorney \ngeneral office.  And I'm sure people that have worked in the U.S. solicitor general's office would say the same thing.\n\nSESSIONS: Even if the immediate short-term effect may be to undermine some social policy that is maybe popular \nat the moment or right even, if it's not done in a proper legal way or it's done in a way that undermines the long-\nterm prerogative of a state, you would expect a state to defend against that, would you not?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I think every state has to make a decision what it's going to do in a given case.  But it is true, and \nmy understanding -- I don't know all state constitutions, but I'm familiar with many of them -- that the state attorney \ngenerals don't have choices in these matters.\n\nAnd that's particularly true in sovereign immunity cases, where at the end of the day there's a claim of -- an \nindividual's claim, but there's also a claim for money.  And the AGs -- it's the same with the U.S. solicitor general -- \nthey don't have the keys to the vault.  The keys to the vault are with the legislature and the executive branch. And \nthe lawyers have an obligation to defend as long as the executive branch tells them to defend.\n\nSESSIONS: Well, as a former attorney general and former United States attorney representing the United States in \ncourt, I can tell you an attorney general that allows a state's sovereign immunity to be eroded I think is going to \nhave a difficult time justifying that position.\n\nAnd so with regard to the Alabama case, you not only filed a brief on behalf of the State of Alabama, but you also \ngained support from a number of other attorneys general, including a democratic attorney general Mark Pryor, \nwho's now a member of this Senate.  Is that not correct?\n\nSUTTON: I think that is true.  There was an amicus brief of states.  And I'm fairly confident that Arkansas joined that \nbrief.  In fact, I thought that brief was balanced half Democratic AGs and half Republican AGs, is my rough \nrecollection.\n\nSESSIONS: And they saw the issue not as a disability issue but as a question of state power and sovereign \nimmunity; is that correct?\n\nSUTTON: That's my understanding.  I haven't read that brief in a while.  But I think it did make the point that just as \nthe United States has a sovereign immunity power, so do the states, at least as U.S. Supreme Court has construed \nit to date.\n\nSESSIONS: Well, I think that's important for us to think about.\n\nYou defended criminals, have you not, and advocated?  Any legal, justifiable position that they were entitled to you \nwere prepared to defend?\n\nSUTTON: I know you're a former prosecutor, but yes, I have on several occasions.  And I think members of the bar \n-- these are pro bono efforts, and I think members of the bar not only should but have a duty to do those kinds of \nrepresentations.\n\nSESSIONS: And so I don't think there's anything wrong with you defending states who feel they're wronged and \ntheir rights are not being upheld.  And in fact that case you took to the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme \nCourt agreed with you.\n\n\n\nSUTTON: It turns out they agreed with the University of Alabama, yes, they did.  Yes.\n\nSESSIONS: And in that case you never argued against the rights of the disabled but against the rights of \nCongress to abrogate a state's constitutional right to sovereign immunity.  I mean, that was the question, was it \nnot?\n\nSUTTON: That is the question.  And it is an important point. Because even after the Garrett case, every state in the \ncountry is entitled to waive its immunity from ADA lawsuits for money damages. In fact, many states do that to the \nextent their legislature permits it.  And just as Congress can do it when federal employees are sued for disability \ndiscrimination.  Sometimes there's a waiver, sometimes there's not. But nothing about either the brief we argued or \nthe decision of the case bars a state from waiving its immunity from suit in federal court.  That could obviously \nhappen.\n\nSESSIONS: And the United States Government can intervene and sue a state for money damages for disability \nviolation, can it not?\n\nSUTTON: That's also true.\n\nSESSIONS: And a private person can sue the state for injunctive relief to get the state enjoined from unfairly \ntreating them due to a disability; is that not correct?\n\nSUTTON: In fact, get their job back, exactly.  Yes.\n\nSESSIONS: And private persons can sue under a state's own laws to enforce money damages or other relief.\n\nSUTTON: That's true, yes.\n\nSESSIONS: So it's just this narrow point of sovereign immunity on which the Congress up and took it upon itself to \nlimit the state's sovereign immunity that this case turned on.\n\nSUTTON: That's true.  And even then Congress can still do the same thing either by passing new legislation with \ndifferent fact findings or by enacting spending clause legislation.  As I'm sure you know, Congress has already done \nthat under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In the Garrett case Ms. Garrett has a claim which is still pending \nunder that very law.\n\nSo it was just about Section 5.  And of course it had nothing to do with the spending clause, where Congress has \nconspicuously broad powers.\n\nSESSIONS: Well, I just would say in conclusion how much I appreciate the three of you.  You're outstanding \nnominees with terrific records, unsurpassed experience handling some of our country's most difficult cases in ways \nthat I think have shown your mettle and your ability.\n\nI congratulate you on the nominations to these important offices. I feel like it's good for us to go through this process \nso that we confront the issue that just because a lawyer takes a position in a case does not mean that they are \nagainst the policy involved in the case.  It does not mean, if you defend a criminal, that you are for criminals or \nyou're for law breakers.  It means that criminals have certain rights and the law has to be carried out in certain \nproper ways.\n\nAnd I believe that's your record in all of these cases.  And I thank you for that.  And I believe the president has done \nan outstanding job in these nominations.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you, Senator Sessions.\n\nWe'll turn to Senator Durbin now.\n\nDURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n\nI want to thank the nominees who are here before us today for your patience.  And I hope that you understand that \nit is an unusual circumstance when we have three judges at this level being considered at the same time this early \nin the session, particularly when there are many questions to be asked of each of them.  That is meant that this \nhearing has gone on much longer than usual, and it's likely to continue for some period of time.\n\nI know the chairman of the committee.  And we've worked together in past years.  And I'm sure we will in the future.  \nI just hope that the pace of the hearings is not such that this will appear to be a receiving line at an Irish wedding in \nterms of the nominees.  I think we need to take time and deliberate, to ask important questions so that the people of \nthis country know a little bit more about those who seek lifetime appointments to the second highest court of the \nland.\n\nI would like to ask my questions of Professor Sutton because I have in this first round tried to focus on his activity \nand his career.  And I will return to the other nominees in another round.\n\nProfessor Sutton, I've listened to some of your early testimony before this committee.  It is interesting, as I reflect on \nit, if you accept the premise that was recently stated by my colleague from Alabama that this is a somewhat \nmechanical and automatic process, that a judge seeks the circuit court, for example, simply to read past cases, \napply them to current cases, and move on, then it would strike me as odd that we don't have more nominees who \nare Democrats before us from the Bush White House.\n\nDURBIN: Apparently there is a belief in the White House that even though it's a fairly automatic and mechanical \nprocess, they want to make sure that if they're going to err, they're going to err on the side of people who have \nsimilar political views to the president.\n\nThat suggests to me that this is not an automatic process. And I think, I hope that you would concede that many \nclose cases give judges at every level a chance to see a new facet of the law that hasn't been seen before and \nperhaps in seeing it and ruling on it to change the course of that law in its future.  Would you concede that point?\n\nSUTTON: There's no doubt even court of appeals judges deal with difficult issues.\n\nBut I do think a point that was raised earlier is a good one, that whether it's the Sixth Circuit, other courts of \nappeals, or even the U.S. Supreme Court, a high percentage of cases are either unanimous or fairly unanimous, if \nit's at the U.S. Supreme Court, precisely because there usually are right answers.\n\nBut I couldn't agree with you more that every now and then you do get very difficult cases. Of course the more \ndifficult the case, and particularly if they involve the constitutionality of a federal law, the more likely the U.S. \nSupreme Court would review it.\n\nBut I think your point is a very good and a fair one.\n\nDURBIN: I think it's an important one.  Vast majority of bills and resolutions in the House and Senate never get any \nattention, nor should they. A handful of important bills come before us, and we have to make a decision as to \nwhether they should be the law of the land.\n\nAnd that really goes to the point that's been made over and over as to your values, who you are, what you're going \nto do in those close calls when you have a case that truly is going to set a new precedent that is really going to \nopen up the new line of thinking. And I think the fact that the reaction to your nomination has been so heated is an \nindication that many people are concerned that when it comes down to those close cases, when the issue before \nthe court is an issue of civil rights or human rights, the rights of minorities or women or the disabled in America, \nthat you have shown a pattern of conduct of insensitivity by virtue of your advocacy in the past.\n\nI've never seen a hearing where we've had so many disabled Americans come forward, frankly, to protest your \nnomination.  It tells me that they're concerned about you and what really is in your heart.\n\nNow, in the past in our history it's seldom do people announce publicly that they're prejudiced.  They don't say that.  \nIt's rare. The primacy of states' rights has historically been the beard for discrimination in America.  Only a few \n\n\n\npeople are bold enough to just state forthright that they oppose civil rights, the rights of women, minorities, and the \ndisabled.\n\nInstead, most have argued that they were not opposed to civil rights but only the power of the federal government \nto protect them. History has not been kind to those who concealed their sentiments in this legal distinction.\n\nMr. Sutton, Professor Sutton, your legal career has been spent practicing time and again in the shadows of state \nrights.  You've said in publications that have been quoted over and over again how much you value federalism \nand this whole issue where time and again you've found yourself in key cases, like Garrett, on the side of states' \nrights as opposed to individual rights.  You have become a predictable, reliable legal voice for entities seeking to \nlimit the rights of Americans in the name of states' rights.\n\nDo you believe that the Garrett case, despite what Senator Sessions has said, and its conclusion expanded or \nrestricted the rights of disabled Americans?\n\nSUTTON: Well, there's no doubt that restriction in the sense that in that particular case someone was seeking relief \nand they didn't get it.  But in that particular case, as I think I pointed out earlier, Ms. Garrett's Section 504 \nRehabilitation Act claim is still pending, so she still may get relief, would be the first point. The second point is what \nthe court did -- and I would point out that is not a case I have spoken publicly about. That's not a case I've written \nabout.  It was a case I was arguing on behalf of a client.  I think the state did deserve representation at the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I think it would have been quite unusual had they not had it.\n\nBut even in that case with all of that, all it said was that the state at the end of the day was in charge of deciding \nwhen they could waive their sovereign union, the same way the U.S. Supreme Court has said the same thing about \nthe United States government.  It doesn't mean in future cases claims can't be brought in federal court if states \nwaive them.  And many states have waived them.\n\nBut there's one point, though, that I -- some of the charges are -- they're, first of all, charges.  And you asked about \nmy values. And I think that is a fair question. It's an important question.  And I do want to respond to that.\n\nThere's no doubt this country's history, when it comes to states' rights, is despicable. There's no room for argument \nabout that.  And I think you know that's exactly how I feel.  The worst violations, the most egregious violations when \nit comes to states' rights of course came in the area of race discrimination.  And there, if people are going to look at \nmy advocacy, I hope they would appreciate that on a pro bono basis before I was state solicitor I defended Ohio's \nhate crime statute on behalf of every civil rights group with an interest in that type of legislation -- I know the \nfederal government is thinking of doing the same thing -- on behalf of local chapters of the NAACP, the Columbus \nUrban League, several others.\n\nAnd while state solicitor, I helped defend Ohio's set-aside statutes.  So I do -- I know it's very important in this \nprocess for you to raise those questions, and I assume you want me to answer them. And that's -- but they're \n(inaudible)\u2026\n\nDURBIN: But there had to be this moment of truth for you as an attorney when you were asked to represent the \nboard of trustees at the University of Alabama, when you knew that your success in that case would restrict the \nrights of disabled Americans, which you've conceded here, and you decided, not because you were assigned or \nrequired to, that you were going to go forward in that role of advocate.  Now, there are many other examples that \nare exceptions to this rule, but the one that troubles the people who have gathered here in the disability community \nis that conscious of what you were seeking, you went forward and said, \"I'll be the advocate of the cause that will \nrestrict the rights of disabled Americans.\"\n\nDid that ever give you pause as to whether or not that was the just thing to do?\n\nSUTTON: Sure, the case was an excruciatingly difficult case, and it did give me pause.  But first of all, I did not \npursue the case.  I was approached by the state and was hired by the state.\n\n\n\nAnd I did have the option, you're right.  I had the option of saying no.  But remember, that's the exact same choice \nthat the U.S. solicitor general's office has been faced in 88 cases where they have said a claim cannot be brought \nby a federal employee\u2026\n\nDURBIN: (inaudible) solicitor general is not seeking appointment here today or our approval.  It's you.\n\nSUTTON: No, I'm not saying -- I'm not making that point.  I'm making the point that this is the job of an advocate.  \nAnd the job of an advocate is not to decide, as in an exercise of vanity, what would I do?  What could I do?  It was \nlong too late for that.  I was not involved in the underlying decisions of the University of Alabama in terms of what to \ndo with Ms. Garrett.  I wasn't involved in the development of their constitutional arguments in the district court and in \nthe court of appeals.\n\nI became involved when they asked me to represent them in the U.S. Supreme Court.  And I think if I have a sin \nhere, the sin was that I did want to develop a U.S. Supreme Court practice.  There's no doubt about that.  And \nmaybe that's what led me to take the case.\n\nBut, Senators, I've done several cases, in fact more cases, on the disability rights side of the equation.\n\nDURBIN: Do you think there would have been a time when you would have had that chance to argue before the \nSupreme Court and would have said to yourself, \"Rather than get another notch in my gun to go up to the Supreme \nCourt, I just don't want to be identified with a case that restricts human rights, civil rights, the rights of the \ndisabled\"?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHATCH: Let's -- let's have order.\n\nSUTTON: Senator, I respectfully -- and you know this is a difficult place to make this point in this forum.  But I \ncouldn't disagree with you more.  I think it is exceedingly wrong to ascribe the views of the client to the lawyer.  \nThat's exactly what the ABA Code says.  It's exactly what would prevent any criminal defense lawyer.\n\nI mean, I've represented two capital inmates.  It doesn't mean I agree with their underlying acts or what happened.  \nThey deserved a representation.  I've provided that representation.\n\nThe one case -- and this is I think the fair response to your question and your concern -- I've only had one case that \nI can think of where I was given an opportunity to represent either side of a civil rights case.  That's the Cheryl \nFischer case.  When that came up to the Ohio Supreme Court, I was given the opportunity to represent Cheryl \nFischer, help her get into Case Western University as a blind medical student, or represent the side of the state \nuniversities who wanted to deny her that right.\n\nI recommended to the attorney general -- it was her choice of course -- that the state solicitor ought to argue that \ncase.  And I thought she had the better side of the argument.  I did everything I can or could to make that argument.\n\nI've represented the National Coalition for Students with Disability in applying federal law, the Motor Voter Law, so \nthat students with disabilities have access to the right to the vote.\n\nIn a case pending in the Ohio supreme court, the Gobo (ph) case, I inserted an argument not made below that an \napplication of Ohio insurance law would violate the ADA.\n\nMy father, you know, ran a school cerebral palsy children.  I mean, I wouldn't say this is a perspective that is lost on \nme. But I did feel at that time my higher obligation was to the client and that they did deserve a right to \nrepresentation before the court.\n\nDURBIN: Well, I'll concede that you have represented many different clients.  But when it comes to the cases that \nyou've been involved in that had the broadest impact on the greatest number of Americans and their rights, it is \nhard to find a case that really in your career that matches the Garrett case.\n\n\n\nWhat was decided by the court by virtue of your argument has denied rights disabled people across America.  It \nhas restricted their rights to recover under the law.\n\nAnd as Senator Schumer said earlier, you can represent a lot of individual defendants before you make up for the \nloss of rights to a class of individuals, disabled individuals, because of that decision.\n\nMay I ask another question?\n\nAs we've tried to monitor the legal DNA of President Bush's nominees, we find repeatedly the Federalist Society \nchromosome.  And I would like to ask you as an officer of the Federalist Society -- and I know every time I raise this \nat a hearing the right wing press screams bloody murder that this is dirty politics, but you have represented that \nyou're an officer of the Federalist Society -- where is it that membership in the Federalist Society has become the \nsecret handshake of the Bush nominees for the federal court?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I don't know that that's true.  I don't have any idea whether it is true.\n\nThe one point I would make is while I am a member of the Federalist Society, I'm also a member of the Equal \nJustice Foundation. And I hope in thinking about my nomination -- I know how important it is to realize who this \nperson is and what kind of judge they would be -- you will keep in mind that while I have been a member of the \nFederalist Society, I was asked separately to join the Equal Justice Foundation, whose whole purpose is to provide \nlegal service to the indigent. That of course is a pro bono effort.  It takes more time than anything I do for the \nFederalist Society.\n\nAnd as to the rest of the your question, I don't know the answer. But I hope you\u2026\n\nDURBIN: Let me just ask you your impression. What in your mind is the Federalist Society philosophy that draws so \nmany Bush nominees to the federal bench to its membership?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I have no idea of what their philosophy is.  In fact my understanding is they don't take --\n\nDURBIN: Are you an officer?  Are you not an officer?\n\nSUTTON: I'm an officer of the separation of powers working group, that's true.  But that doesn't mean there is a \nphilosophy.  In fact my understanding of the society is they don't take positions on cases.\n\nThe one point I would make is my understanding of the purpose of the Federalist Society and the reason I was \nattracted to joining it was that they've tried to sponsor forums to discuss important legal issues.  And most of my \ninvolvement has been in the Columbus chapter to that end.\n\nAnd I think the Federalist Society has done a very good job having presentations that involve speakers on both \nsides of the issue. In fact, most of the criticism I have heard of the federalism decisions all came from Federalist \nSociety publications.  First time I saw anyone criticize Lawrence Tribe was in a Federalist Society publication.\n\nMy article about the City of Boerne decision was a point- counterpoint piece next to Judge McConnell's, Judge \nMcConnell saying it was wrongly decided, my thing was rightly decided.\n\nSo I do think they tried hard to do that.  I can understand someone having a different perspective on that.\n\nDURBIN: Let me ask you about your representation of tobacco companies in your private practice.  You \nrepresented Lorillard Tobacco in challenging a Massachusetts regulation regarding the sale and promotion of \ntobacco products.  In that case you argued these regulations violated the free speech clause of the First \nAmendment.\n\nIn addition, you've been critical of the $145 billion tobacco judgment in Florida.  Although you're an advocate of \nstates' rights in some contexts, you don't seem to like what they've done to tobacco companies.\n\nWhat is your view generally about the efficacy of tobacco litigation?  And do you feel that's ever justifiable?\n\n\n\nSUTTON: Well, the -- RJR is a Jones Day client.  And that's how I became involved in that case.  I was not involved \nin that case in the lower courts.  I became involved in it when they tried to seek certiorari before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n\nAnd at the time I had a U.S. Supreme Court practice.  And I was asked by the firm to become involved in the case.  \nAnd I did.  I mean it was a firm client.  And I think it would have been a rather unusual decision on my part to not \nrepresent them, be unwilling to represent a client of the firm.\n\nDURBIN: Did you say RJR and Lorillard are clients of the firm?\n\nSUTTON: No.  RJR -- all of the -- the name of the case goes by Lorillard, but it had several tobacco companies in it.\n\nDURBIN: And RJR was your client.\n\nSUTTON: Exactly.  Exactly.\n\nAnd in terms of the case itself, under the free speech clause -- that was the main issue in the case -- it's no surprise \nin most of the biggest U.S. Supreme Court cases the free speech argument is not on behalf of a popular client.  I \nmean that's often -- or for that matter, popular speech.  That's exactly the way it traditionally goes.\n\nAnd I think if you looked at the 20 biggest free speech cases in the country, I suspect you'd disagree with the \nunderlying speech in every single one of them.\n\nDURBIN: I understand that.  And historically\u2026\n\nSUTTON: But it's a constitutional right.  And even though they may be -- you know, it's a company with which \npeople can disagree with the work they're doing, their products are legal.  They've not been outlawed.  And I think \nthey do have a right to raise a constitutional defense.\n\nDURBIN: I don't argue with that premise at all. Again, it's a question about that moment in time when the senior \npartner came in and said, \"Jeff, want you to take up the cause of RJR.  Somebody's trying to restrict their \nadvertising that's appealing to children.\"\n\nDURBIN: And you said, \"I'll take it.\" That's a tough call.\n\nAnd lawyers in their profession make those difficult calls.  But I'm again trying to find out what is driving you and \nmotivating you in terms of your legal values.\n\nAnd as you said, it was one of the clients of the firm.\n\nI don't know how much time I have left here.\n\nHATCH: Your time has been up.\n\nDURBIN: All right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n\nThank you, Professor Sutton.\n\nHATCH: Well, we'll begin our second round then.\n\nDEWINE: No.  I haven't gone yet.\n\nHATCH: Well, could I ask one question before you do, and then I'll turn to you?\n\nDEWINE: But I haven't done anything on my first round.\n\nHATCH: OK.  Well, I didn't know whether you\u2026\n\n\n\nDEWINE: No.  We haven't completed this round.\n\nLEAHY (?): I thought you did a second round.\n\nDEWINE: No.  I haven't done a second.  I haven't done a first round.\n\nHATCH: Well, let's turn to Senator DeWine.\n\nDEWINE: You can go ahead, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: No.  No.  You go ahead. That's OK.\n\nDEWINE: Mr. Sutton, good afternoon.  I know it's been a long day already for all of you.  And we appreciate you all \nhanging with us.\n\nHATCH: Excuse me just one second.\n\nIf you need a break, just raise your hand and I'll be glad to --\n\nSUTTON: I'm proving I'm older than I look.  I'm getting there. But I'll go another half-hour.\n\nHATCH: Why don't we go another half-hour, and then we'll -- let's go another 15 minutes with Senator DeWine.  \nAnd then we'll break\u2026\n\nDEWINE: See who has the guts to raise their hand, right?\n\nHATCH: We'll break for five minutes and then come back.\n\nDEWINE: The good news for all of you, it is a lifetime appointment, so\u2026\n\nLEAHY (?): You probably feel like today's been a lifetime.\n\nDEWINE: Probably is right.  Absolutely.\n\nMr. Sutton, I don't pretend to be a legal scholar.  But I did have the opportunity to look at a lot of the cases that have \ngotten the bulk of the publicity in regard to the cases that you've argued before the Supreme Court.  And I was here \nin the Congress when we passed the ADA.\n\nAnd I must be candid and tell you that I think if I was on the Supreme Court I would have decided these cases \ndifferently.  I don't agree with the decisions.  I don't agree with the bulk of the decisions that you argued in front of \nthe Supreme Court, at least on the controversial ones.\n\nBut I'm not sure how relevant that is.  In fact, I don't think it's relevant at all.\n\nI want to follow up the line of questioning from my good friend Senator Durbin.  I wish he was here.  I know he had \nto go to another meeting.\n\nBut I think as we go down and start down a very dangerous path when we probe deeply into the clients and the \ncauses that nominees have either advocated or represented.  I think it's legitimate.  I think we look at them.  But I \nthink when we start down that path it is rather dangerous.\n\nIt's dangerous if we conclude that a person cannot go on the federal bench because of certain clients that they have \nrepresented or because of certain positions they may have taken in arguing a case before the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States or any other court.  If we follow that position, it would be many principled lawyers in our history who \nnever would have served on the federal bench.\n\nBut more importantly, if this committee would be saying that and if this Senate would be saying that, I think it would \nhave a chilling effect in the practice of law as we know it in this country.  How many young lawyers would say to \n\n\n\nthemself, \"I can't take this case.  I can't represent this client.  I can't advocate this position because, you know, \nsomeday I may want to serve as a judge.  Someday I may want to be on the federal bench\"?  And all the young \nlawyers I think at one point in time think that they would like to be a judge. Some of them get over it.  But many of \nthem feel that way at some point.\n\nSo I think it's a mistake.  I don't fault any of my colleagues for engaging in that conversation, that give-and-take and \ntrying to find out what is in Mr. Sutton or Mr. Roberts' or Justice Cook's heart and soul.  I think that's legitimate.\n\nBut if we extend it to the natural consequence of that discussion and really say, \"No, we can't put that person on the \nbench because they advocated that position,\" I think that is a very, very serious mistake.  And whether it is, you \nlook back in history and whether it's John Adams and the Boston Massacre or whether Thurgood Marshall \nrepresenting rapists or whoever, whatever the case might be -- and we can go back in history.  I think it would be a \nvery, very serious mistake.  And if we had applied that law, we would have been denied some very great people on \nthe federal bench and in politics and in government. And I think it would have been a mistake.\n\nI think ultimately, Mr. Sutton and all of you, the question is, will you follow the law?  Will you follow the Constitution?  \nAnd will you follow the precedent?  I assume from each one of you the answer is yes.\n\nMr. Roberts?\n\nROBERTS: Yes, Senator.\n\nCOOK: Yes, Senator.\n\nDEWINE: Mrs. Cook?\n\nCOOK: Yes, indeed.\n\nDEWINE: Mr. Sutton?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, Senator.\n\nDEWINE: Mr. Sutton, let me read you the entire section of the 1990 Legal Times article that was quoted to you.  It's \nonly a part of the article, but I think it was excerpted a little bit and I want to read it to you.\n\nQuote, \"Sutton says he and his staff are always on the lookout for cases coming before the court that raise issues \nof federalism or will affect local and state government interests,\" end of quote.\n\nWhat position did you hold at that point in time?  And who was your staff?  What were you talking about?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, Senator, I was the state solicitor at that point.\n\nDEWINE: At that time you were a state solicitor.\n\nSUTTON: I was state solicitor.\n\nDEWINE: Why were you looking for these cases?\n\nSUTTON: Because Betty Montgomery, the attorney general, correctly realized -- I think she had some vision in this \narea -- that just because a case comes from another state, another set of courts, and goes to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt doesn't mean it's not going to affect them.  In fact, it's just the opposite.  You could have a case coming from \nArkansas, Alabama, California, and it will -- once the U.S. Supreme Court decides that issue of federal statutory \nlaw, U.S. constitutional law, that decision is binding on every state, including Ohio.\n\nAnd what the article was pointing out and what Betty Montgomery asked me to do and we did do was to look for \ncases principally in her area of interest. Her area of interest was of course criminal law. She's a former prosecutor. \nAnd we must have sought out and written -- you know, I don't want to exaggerate -- I'm sure it's several dozen, if \n\n\n\nnot considerably more, briefs in U.S. Supreme Court cases generally advancing her perspective on criminal law \nissues, which was her interest and what she asked us to do.\n\nAnd those were the types of case -- in fact, I think the article was about one of those cases.  It was not about a \nSection 5 case about City of West Covina v. Perkins, which involved the due process clause and return of property \nthat was seized in a Fourth Amendment seizure and the procedural protections individuals have and their rights in \ngetting it back.\n\nDEWINE: Mr. Sutton, I'd like to clarify one point.  And we've had a little discussion about this.  Your name plate \nsays \"Professor Jeffrey Sutton.\" I think you're listed that way maybe because the committee put it down that way \nbecause you're an adjunct professor. This is a little different than a full-time professor.\n\nI just state that because the articles you've written were written by you really, though, in your role as a lawyer, not \nas an academic; is that correct?\n\nSUTTON: Oh, absolutely.  In fact, the first articles that I mentioned were articles written while I was state solicitor \nand of course pursuing the job I was asked to do representing the state.  I think one or two of them were written \nafter I was state solicitor, but the commentary was principally about cases I argued.\n\nAnd of course a lawyer would have an ethical obligation not to say publicly that his or her client in a given case had \nurged a position that was ultimately incorrectly decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.  I mean, in those cases my \nclients happened to win.  And it would have been not only unusual but I think ethically barred for me to publicly say \nthe U.S. Supreme Court was wrong in those decisions.\n\nAnd I was -- if one reads those articles, one would see pretty quickly that they were simply recycling the briefs that I \nhad written in those very cases, in fact, I hate to say it, word for word.  I don't think one can plagiarize oneself.  But \nif one can, I've just made an awful admission. But that's what you would see if you read those articles and \ncompared them to the briefs.\n\nDEWINE: I want to go back to the City of Boerne case and the discussion you had with Senate Schumer a few \nminutes ago.  In that exchange he asked you about a supposed position that you took during oral argument.  And I \nwould like to clarify it. As I understand it, you argue that Congress does have the authority to enforce the Bill of \nRights using Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment as those rights are incorporated in Section 1 of the \nFourteenth Amendment.\n\nSo as I understand it, you argued that federal authority was broader and that the federal government has the \nauthority to protect more rights than some of the other parties in the case did.  So in that case with regard to your \nposition Senator Schumer's concerns were unfounded.\n\nSUTTON: I think that's right, Senator.  It was a very important issue in City of Boerne because until that decision \nU.S. Supreme Court had not clarified that critical point.  If one looked at all of the Section 5 laws that had been \nreviewed for a hundred-plus years by the U.S. Supreme Court, you would have seen that they all involve, at least \nthe ones that were upheld, racial discrimination remediation or voting rights remediation.  They hadn't extended to \nthe other Bill of Rights protections, whether it's free speech, criminal rights protections, or in the case of City of \nBoerne, free exercise of religion.\n\nAnd the state was in a difficult position in that case because the party in the case, City of Boerne, had taken the \nposition, because no case had held otherwise, that Section 5 only allowed Congress to correct race discrimination \nand voting rights discrimination.  And we were in a difficult position.\n\nUsually an amicus tends to agree with the party that you're supporting.  But at the same time -- not that reasonable \nminds couldn't disagree with this point.  And Justice Scalia also gave me a very hard time on this -- but took the \nview that by its terms the Constitution said Section 5 enforces the provisions of Section 1. Section 1 says due \nprocess.  The U.S. Supreme Court had construed the due process clause to incorporate many, if not all of -- well, \nmost of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.  And so we made that argument.\n\n\n\nAnd Justice Scalia gave me a very difficult time.  I mean, if you've ever seen him ask a question, my knees clearly \nquivered.  But I mean my backbone did stiffen on this point.  And we said, \"That's wrong, Justice Scalia, by its \nterms.  And you know, as a textualist, I have to -- you should agree with this.  By its terms it covers all rights \nprotected by Section 1.\"\n\nSo while, you know, there's parts of that outcome of that case that one could be unhappy with and certainly \nreasonable minds could disagree with, we feel good about that part.  The court did agree with us on this.\n\nDEWINE: Good.\n\nJustice Cook, you have been making appellate court decisions now for well over a decade.  Obviously in that time \nyou've developed a style and a way of making decisions, an approach to that job.  Tell us how you approach the \njob, how you do that, and how you would approach the job as a circuit court judge.\n\nCOOK: I\u2026\n\nDEWINE: Got to be a technique.  There's got to be a way of doing it.  Everyone's got their own style.  How would \nyou do it?  How do you do it now?\n\nCOOK: My process is structured, and I hope you would find it principled.  And it's the process I think most appellate \njudges engage in.  It's first a review of the record of proceedings, a reading, a thorough reading and studying of the \ncontesting briefs, then a review of the existing law, and then the application of logic, sometimes custom, and \ngenerally rules.\n\nAnd this is done -- you know, I give some credit to my counsel because every judge has talented law clerks and in \nmy chambers -- actually some of my clerks are still here, I think -- in my chambers my clerks do serve as my \ncounsel.  And so I think with that process generally and with the inclusion of bright young minds to challenge any \ndecisions that I come to, I think we achieve the impartiality and really the objective approach that fairness dictates.\n\nAnd any good jurist engages in pretty much that same decisional process, I would say, Senator.\n\nDEWINE: Do you go through a few drafts?\n\nCOOK: Oh, yes.\n\nAnd then we exchange the drafts among the members of the court. And in that process we are also able to learn, \nyou know, if any other member of the court writes a concurrence or a dissent that helps in our decision-making to \ndouble-check our reasoning, to double-check our research.  And so it's a process.  It's a learning process at its \nbase.\n\nAnd that's our job.\n\nDEWINE: Good.  Thank you very much.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you, Senator.\n\nLet's take a five-minute break.  And we'll come right back, OK.\n\n(RECESS)\n\nHATCH: OK, we'll start this second round of questions.  And maybe I can start it off, or if -- would Senator Leahy \nprefer?\n\nLEAHY: No, go ahead.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, I'll start it off.  And we'll turn to Senator Leahy as soon as I'm through.\n\nAnd hopefully this is all the round we need.  But I want my colleagues to feel like they've been treated fairly.  And I \nwant them to be able to ask what questions they have in mind.\n\nBut there has to be a reasonable time.  And we'll call this at a reasonable time.  And this is their chance to question \nthe three of you.  And we'll just have to see what happens.\n\nWell, let me just go back to you, Mr. Sutton.  As a matter of fact, I understand that you came to represent the \nUniversity of Alabama in the Garrett case because the Alabama attorney general's office called you up and asked \nyou to take the case; is that right?\n\nSUTTON: That's correct.\n\nHATCH: OK.  So you were asked by the attorney general of the state of Alabama.\n\nWhat if it had been the other way around?  I mean what would you have done if Mrs. Garrett or the United States \nhad called you up and asked you to represent their side in the Garrett case?  Would you have done it?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, your Honor, absolutely.  And I would have been very eager to represent that side of the case, either \nfor Ms. Garrett or, if I'd been fortunate enough to be in the solicitor general's office.\n\nHATCH: So when you represented your clients you were doing what attorneys do, represent clients.\n\nSUTTON: Yes, I was.\n\nHATCH: I have to admit I'm absolutely nonplused that some of my colleagues seem to think that you should only \nrepresent the people who agree with them.  Now, I don't know any attorney who does that who's worth his salt, who \nreally has any real broad experience.\n\nYou're not going to please everybody by the people you represent. But to ascribe to you the negative aspects of \nyour clients, I think it the height of sophistry.  And it's really bothering me that on this committee with the \nsophistication of this committee that we've had those type of indications.\n\nLet me just ask you this.  Now, I get so sick and tired of the Federalist Society, they beat up on the Federalist \nSociety on that.  I happen to be a member.  I'm on the board of advisers.  I know what they do.  I know what they \ndon't do.\n\nNow, since your membership on the Federalist Society has been raised here today and since various groups, such \nas the People for the American Way and NARAL, the National Abortion Rights Action League, have also \nexpressed concern over your involvement with that group, just let me ask you a few questions about it.\n\nYou are indeed a member of the Federalist Society, are you not?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, I am.\n\nHATCH: OK.  Well, I am too.  And I happen to think that it's one of the best organizations in the whole country.  And \nI've found, frankly, that the Federalist Society encourages open and honest discussion from all points of view from a \nvariety of perspectives on a multitude of current issues.\n\nHave you found the same thing?\n\nSUTTON: I have, your honor.  In the cases I argued on behalf of several clients, I've seen as much criticism of \nthose cases in Federalist Society publications as I've seen anywhere.\n\nHATCH: I have never known the Federalist Society to take a position on any issue.\n\n\n\nDo you know whether they have?\n\nSUTTON: I'm not aware of that, no.\n\nHATCH: Well, I don't think I've ever seen it.  So I'm getting a little tired of this beating up on the Federalist Society \nas though they're some sort of a secret society.  It's the most open society in our country right now from a legal \nstandpoint.\n\nIn fact Federalist Society events are known for their intellectual vigor and open debate.\n\nDo you differ with that statement?\n\nSUTTON: I don't to the extent I've been to them, yes.\n\nHATCH: Leading liberal academics and government officials regularly participate in the organization's events; isn't \nthat correct?\n\nSUTTON: That is correct.\n\nHATCH: From all points of view.\n\nSUTTON: That's very correct.\n\nHATCH: From the right to the left, right?\n\nSUTTON: Yes, exactly.\n\nHATCH: Regular participants include Walter Dellinger.  Walter Dellinger was President Clinton's acting solicitor \ngeneral.  Very, very intelligent, interesting and good man.  But very liberal.\n\nSteven Reinhardt.  You've got to be pretty liberal to be to the left of Reinhardt, from the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, but one of the really brilliant people in our society.  He really believes in what he does.  Even though I \nthink many justly criticize some of his activist approaches.\n\nHow about Nadine Strossen?  She's the president of the ACLU. She's no shrinking violet.  Yet she participates in \nthe seminars, in the conferences.  Professor Lawrence Tribe of Harvard.  Now, no one would say that Lawrence \nTribe is an insidious conservative.  How about Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago?  He's regular.  They, I \nthink enjoy these give-and-take sessions.  And they should.\n\nDo these sound like a gang of right-wing participants to you?\n\nSUTTON: No.\n\nHATCH: You know, for some reason I knew what your answer was going to be.\n\nLEAHY: I even figured that out.\n\nHATCH: Even Leahy had figured that out.  That's right.  I'm so happy for that.\n\nLEAHY: I'm glad to see you so supportive of Walter Dellinger, insofar as when he was chairman we couldn't get him \nthrough the committee. That's why he was acting solicitor general.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHATCH: Well, I have to say that I do have a lot of respect for Walter.  I do.\n\nLEAHY: You should.\n\n\n\nHATCH: I even have respect for you, Senator Leahy, quite a bit. And I've earned it over the years, I'll tell you.\n\nNow, Mr. Roberts, one of my Democratic colleagues has criticized you, albeit rather regularly, for cases that you \nworked on in your official capacity as principal deputy solicitor general at the Yost (ph) Department of Justice.\n\nThe positions you took in these cases represented the position of the United States government, right?\n\nROBERTS: That's correct.\n\nHATCH: The U.S. government was your client, right?\n\nROBERTS: That's right.\n\nHATCH: You didn't necessarily choose these cases, right?\n\nROBERTS: No.\n\nHATCH: You had supervisors who worked with you?\n\nROBERTS: Yes.\n\nHATCH: Suggestions were made to you?\n\nROBERTS: Yes.\n\nHATCH: And you followed the suggestions?\n\nROBERTS: Yes.\n\nAnd quite often of course we were in a defensive position defending federal agencies that were sued in court.\n\nHATCH: Sure.  And as I.\n\nAm I correct that the government's position in these cases was often arrived at as a result of a collaborative process \nin which many different persons aired and debated different views?\n\nROBERTS: It's a very broad collaborative process.  I don't think everyone's familiar with it.  But when a case \nreaches the Supreme Court that might affect the federal government or in which a federal agency has been a party, \nyou canvass the whole scope of the federal government.  And in a typical case you'll get responses from 10 \ndifferent agencies, sometimes all over the map, sometimes, you know, consistent in the position, a number of \ndifferent divisions within the department, different offices all weighing in on what the position of the United States \nshould be.\n\nHATCH: Well, and as a lawyer in the solicitor general's office, you were dutybound to represent the official position \nof the United States, even if it conflicted with your own personal beliefs, right?\n\nROBERTS: Certainly.\n\nHATCH: That's what attorneys do.\n\nROBERTS: Not only in the public sector but I think in the private sector as well that that's the highest tradition of the \nAmerican bar.\n\nHATCH: Well, I have to again caution my Democratic colleagues about the danger in inferring that government \nlawyers' personal views from the position he or she takes as an attorney for the United States.\n\nI think of Walter Dellinger who, as we all know, served as solicitor general during the Clinton administration said it \nbest.  He said that it is, quote, \"very risky,\" unquote, to judge judicial nominees by the positions they have taken as \n\n\n\ngovernment lawyers and that such judgments may lead to a rejection of, quote, \"the most qualified of the \nnominees,\" those who, like Mr. Roberts, have been out and have had a \"major lifetime of accomplishment,\" \nunquote.  One of the leading Democrat legal thinkers in the country.\n\nNow, specifically, with regard to Mr. Roberts, Mr. Dellinger said this.  Quote, \"The kind of arguments that John \nRoberts was making in the position of deputy solicitor general were the type of argument that a professional is \nexpected to make when his client, the chief executive of which is the president of the United States, has run on \nthose positions,\" unquote.\n\nNow, Mr. Roberts, I want the persons who have made predictions about how you will rule as a judge to listen to \nsome of the things your colleagues, the persons who know you best, have said about you.\n\nShortly after your nomination in 2001, the committee received a letter from 13 of your former colleagues at the \nsolicitor general's office.  Now, I want to read a portion of this letter because I think it will help my colleagues in \nevaluating your nomination.\n\nThe letter says, quote, \"Although we are of diverse political parties and persuasions, each of us is firmly convinced \nthat Mr. Roberts would be a truly superb addition to the federal court of appeals.  Mr. Roberts was attentive and \nrespectful of all views.  And he represented the United States zealously but fairly.  He had the deepest respect for \nlegal principles and legal precedent, instincts that will serve him well as a court of appeals judge,\" unquote.\n\nIn recent days the suggestion has surfaced in press accounts that Mr. Roberts, meaning you, may be expected to \nvote along the lines intimated in briefs you filed while in the office of solicitor general.  In fact this is their quote.  Let \nme just quote it.\n\nThese are your colleagues from diverse political views, Democrats, Republican's, maybe some who aren't either.  \nThey say, quote, \"In recent days the suggestion has surfaced in press accounts that Mr. Roberts may be expected \nto vote in particular cases along the lines intimated in briefs he filed while in the office of the solicitor general.  As \nlawyers who served in that office, we emphatically dispute that assumption.\n\n\"Perhaps uniquely in our society, lawyers are called upon to advance legal arguments for clients with whom they \nmay in their private capacities disagree.  It is not unusual for an individual lawyer to disagree with a client while at \nthe same time fulfilling the ethical duty to provide zealous representation within the bounds of law.\n\n\"And government lawyers, including those who serve in the solicitor general's office, are no different. They too have \nclients, federal agencies and officers with a broad and diverse array of policies and interests.\n\n\"Moreover, the solicitor general, unlike a private lawyer, does not have the option of declining a representation and \ntelling a federal agency to find another lawyer.\"\n\nAnd they go on again, \"We hope the foregoing is of assistance to the committee and its consideration of Mr. \nRoberts' nomination.  He is a superbly qualified nominee.\" I'll submit it.  Unquote.\n\nI will submit a copy of that letter for the record along with copies of several other letters echoing support for your \nnomination.\n\nNow, the resounding theme of these letters is that you will be a fair and impartial judge whose deep respect for law \nand the principle of stare decisis, combined with your brilliance, will make you one of the greatest federal judges \never confirmed.\n\nNow, people who know you, that's the way they feel, regardless of their political beliefs or their ideological beliefs, \nthat you're a great lawyer, as are the other two on this panel.\n\nI've had Supreme Court justices say you are one of the two greatest appellate lawyers living today, to me \npersonally.  Now, they don't do that very easily.  And I think everybody who knows you knows that that's how good \nyou are.\n\n\n\nThis is not your first appointment to the courts, is it?\n\nROBERTS: No, Mr. Chairman, it's not.\n\nHATCH: When were you nominated before and by whom?\n\nROBERTS: I was nominated 11 years ago last Monday to the same court by the first President Bush.\n\nHATCH: So basically it's taken you 11 years to get to this particular position.\n\nROBERTS: Well, I like to think I haven't been just treading water in the meantime.  But it has been 11 years.\n\nHATCH: There has been an expiration of 11 years since your first appointment.  And then you've had to be -- you \nwere appointed on May 9th of 2001.\n\nROBERTS: This third round, yes.\n\nHATCH: And then this is the third time you've been reappointed this January by current President Bush.\n\nROBERTS: Correct.\n\nHATCH: Well, I'll reserve the balance of my time.\n\nBut I just wanted to get those points out because, for the life of me, I can't understand why anybody who loves the \nlaw and who respects great lawyers would not want any of the three of you to serve in our federal courts.\n\nI know one thing, I'd sure want to be able to argue cases in front of you.  I know one thing.  I know I'd be treated \nfairly.\n\nAnd you and I both know another thing.  When we tried cases, I didn't want a judge on my side.  I didn't want him \nagainst me.  I wanted the judge, regardless of who it was, to be fair down the middle, to apply the law.  If they did, I \nwas going to win that case. And I could lose a case by the judge favoring me just because the jury would get mad.  \nOr I could lose a case by a judge not favoring me just because the judge was so respected.\n\nAnd we want judges who are going to be down the middle, who are going to -- that doesn't mean you have to be \ndown the middle in ideology and everything else.  Just on the law they're going to be down the middle and do \nwhat's right and honest and legally sound.\n\nWell, I have every confidence that the three of you, each of you, will be exactly that type of a judge.  And I \ncommend you for these nominations, for your nominations.  And I look forward to seeing you confirmed.  And I hope \nwe can do that relatively soon.\n\nSenator Leahy?  I'll reserve my other five minutes.\n\nLEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nI don't know where this pesky idea of the Federalist Society came from.  Probably because one of the nominees \ntestified here under oath that he was told if he wanted to be a federal judge appointed in the Bush administration, \nhe should join the Federalist Society.  I mean, that may have stuck in people's mind, I don't know.\n\nYou know how those little things are.\n\nHATCH: I doubt anybody of any intelligent mind would worry about that.\n\nLEAHY: Well, I would hope you wouldn't suggest that President Bush's nominee who we confirmed as a federal \njudge would be lying under oath.\n\nHATCH: Of course not.\n\n\n\nLEAHY: Am I down to only four minutes, that quickly?\n\nHATCH: Oh, no.  Put this up.  That was my five minutes that was left.\n\nLEAHY: Goodness gracious.  Man, I never should have let you have that big gavel.\n\nBut the Federalist Society's membership certainly hasn't stopped people.  Paul Cassell was confirmed, a member \nconfirmed to Utah District Court.  Karen Caldwell, Edith Brown Clement, Harris Hartz, Lance Africk, Morrison Cohen \nEngland, they're all Federalist members all confirmed.  Michael McConnell to the Tenth Circuit, John Rogers to the \nSixth Circuit, both members.  And Kent Jordan and Arthur Schwab, and Larry Block -- I mean, I could go on and on.  \nIn fact, it seems a lot of them were.\n\nWith this maybe it's coincidence, the statement of one who says that they had to (inaudible) going to be maybe the \njudge or maybe it's coincidence so many have gone through.  But be it as it may, it hasn't been held against them.\n\nLEAHY: Certainly, I would not do as some of my colleagues have on the other side, vote against a nominee as they \nhave a Clinton nominee because she had dared in her private practice to represent a labor union.  That's why they \nvoted against her because of that and I having listened to your testimony, all of you, and Chairman Hatch's \ntestimony, that lawyers take their clients and represent them.\n\nAlthough, I would note just so that it doesn't seem totally one- sided, we had one vote against for defending labor \nunions.  We had another one for taking a couple pro bono cases for the ACLU and so on.\n\nHATCH: Was that Marsha Brazone (ph) who now sits on the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals.\n\nLEAHY: That's right she waited four or five years.\n\nHATCH: Well, I was chairman, I don't\u2026\n\nLEAHY: You were not the one that voted against her.\n\nHATCH: I know, neither were most everybody else.  I'm condemning both sides if they're going to do that type of \nreasoning.\n\nLEAHY: So, I have -- we won't go through a number of the ones that were never given a hearing because their \nclients weren't liked. But let's talk about stare decisis and I'm sure that every one of you would, of course, agree that \nyou would follow stare decisis.\n\nI've never known a judicial nominee to say otherwise and even including some within -- after getting on the bench or \nreverse because they did not follow stare decisis.  But it is a hornbook law that you have to.\n\nNow, (inaudible) Sutton in a Federalist Society paper in 1994, and I realize they don't take any positions on the \nFederalist Society, but you praised the analysis in Justice Clarence Thomas' incurring opinion in Holder v. Hall (ph), \na case that considers Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAnd you specifically praised Justice Thomas for providing persuasive, important regents to reconsider an overrule \nprior court precedent broadly interpreting the Voting Rights Act, and you told the Federalist Society that Justice \nThomas' approach goes a long way to developing a conservative theory for doing an un-conservative thing, \noverruling precedent.  Why wouldn't this just be conservative judicial activism, and I know you were expecting the \nquestions?  I'd like to hear your answer.\n\nSUTTON: No, I wasn't expecting the question.  Why wouldn't in Justice Thomas' position be conservative judicial \nactivism, is that question?\n\nLEAHY: Yes.\n\n\n\nSUTTON: Well, I think the point the article made was that the Section 2 cases have a very difficult set of \ninterpretations for the court in the voting rights area and it's important to remember that in that Holder v. Hall case, \nJustice Thomas' vote was concurrence, the majority.  I don't know exactly what the vote was but I think it was pretty \noverwhelming, ultimately said that you couldn't bring this type of vote dilution claim under Section 2.\n\nJustice Thomas took the view that while that was an application of several cases of the court, including a case \ncalled Allen (ph) I think from the 1960s, that the Allen case and the case after it hadn't been correctly decided and \nthat the court shouldn't have gone down this road trying to determine as a matter of political theory what size a \nvoting group should be in locality, city, number of members.\n\nThe opinion Justice Thomas relied upon was Justice Harlan's opinion in that. I don't remember if he was concurring \nor dissenting. Justice Harlan, of course, is one of the course moderates or at least he's perceived as a moderate, \nnot unlike Justice Powell.  So, I don't think the perspective Justice Thomas had on the case was, you know, out of \nthe mainstream.  He was following Justice Harlan.\n\nBut I guess more importantly, as a Court of Appeals judge, one would not have any option of doing anything of the \nkind.  I mean whatever the court does with\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Not exactly, within your circuit, within your circuit you could overrule stare decisis.\n\nSUTTON: Oh, not -- I understand what you're saying, in other words circuit precedent.\n\nLEAHY: Right, you would not have to -- you would not have to follow, I mean you're presumed that you will follow it \nbut you're not required to follow the precedents of your own circuit and circuits do change, not often, but circuits \neither reverse themselves or circuit judges dissent from positions.  It is not unheard of for a circuit to reverse itself in \na subsequent case.\n\nSUTTON: That's true, although in a panel decision, a three-judge panel doesn't have that option.\n\nLEAHY: I agree.\n\nSUTTON: So, the panel no matter what the prior precedent, no matter how much a judge disagreed with it, they \nhave to follow it, and then and only then, if the\u2026\n\nLEAHY: It goes up (inaudible).\n\nSUTTON: The losing party chooses to ask the entire court, however many members, to decide whether they should \nreview that prior precedent but, of course, that's not one judge's vote.  That's the majority vote of the entire circuit.\n\nLEAHY: That's true.\n\nSUTTON: And I guess the thing that Justice Thomas I thought was trying to do was determine what is the hardest \nthing in this area of neutral principles for not following a precedent, and, to me that was admirable.  The great risk \nwhen it comes to stare decisis is that it becomes results oriented that someone is simply deciding they personally \ndidn't like something and so they vote to overrule it.\n\nThe very point of the article or this section of the article, this was the same article I should point out that was \ncriticizing the court for a ruling that hurt disability rights, but in this part of the article I was simply making the point \nthat neutral principles for determining when stare decisis ought to apply and shouldn't apply are to be applauded, a \ngood idea.\n\nLEAHY: Well, what you said actually there about Justice Thomas was on the one hand adherence to precedent is \nan ostensibly conservative notion, one consistent with a protective alliance interests in particular and furthering \njudicial restraint in general.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, it can't be that all liberal victories become insulated by stare decisis while all conservative ones \nremain open to question, and I worry that what you're doing is suggesting a blueprint for overturning court decisions \nthat maybe some of your friends don't like on civil rights but here your strong adherence, which is a conservative \nprinciple to stare decisis, or am I reading too much into your comments?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I think perhaps a little bit, Senator.  The point I think I was making one I would assume everyone \nwould agree with.  It would not be a very coherent or fair principle of stare decisis that said we only stick with certain \ntypes of precedential rulings and not with others, and simply making the point it is a conservative doctrine to stick \nwith stare decisis.\n\nBut it wouldn't be a legitimate application of stare decisis to not apply it neutrally to all precedents that according -- \nyou know and the U.S. Supreme Court has many cases that have given instruction, not just to the justices, but to \nthe lower courts as to when one would decide.\n\nI mean you know the Buck case that we just talked about earlier forced sterilization handicaps.  I mean if ever there \nwere a case calling for an overruling it would be that case and there are principles, whether the underlying \nreasoning\u2026\n\nLEAHY: We're also not going to have too many Dred Scott or Plessy v. Ferguson or cases like that.  What we're \ngoing to find are some very specific cases following congressional action within the last five years, ten years, or a \nyear, and what I'm trying to determine your full sense of stare decisis.  Let me tell you why some of this comes.  \nYou read the book or are aware of the book Judge Noonan wrote narrowing the nation's power.\n\nSUTTON: I have read the book.\n\nLEAHY: It's a short but really powerful book.  I picked it up one day flying back here from Vermont and decided to \nread it on the plane and was still reading at two o'clock in the morning.  I felt like I was back in law school \ncramming, but I found it difficult to put down.\n\nAnd, he was talking about a number of the reasons why states in effect don't enjoy the sovereign immunity that the, \nwhat I consider a very activist Supreme Court has been giving them in the last few years.  I was persuaded by the \nconclusion the best reason a state should not enjoy immunity from suit is that such treatment is simply unjust.\n\nWhy shouldn't a state pay its just debts?  Why shouldn't it compensate victims for the harm it wrongly causes?  Or, \nwhy should states be subject to federal patent law and federal copyright law and federal prohibition or \ndiscrimination from our employment but not be accountable if it invades somebody else's patent or copyrights or \naccountable for discriminatory acts as the employer.\n\nI mean has the Supreme Court in these areas, copyright, patent law and others, have they been as some have said \na very activist court, or do you agree, are you very comfortable with the decision they've made?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I can't say I read Judge Noonan's book as quickly as you did but I\u2026\n\nLEAHY: No, no, no.  Wait, I don't want to -- I read it until two o'clock in the morning.  That doesn't mean that I would \nwant to do my third year law exam on the book, but these are some of the things that I got out of it.\n\nSUTTON: No, I did read the book.  I enjoyed the book.  I think he makes a forceful case for that position and I \nactually think that's the most difficult position the court has taken in all of these, we'll call them \"federalism cases.\"\n\nLEAHY: Are you comfortable with those -- with the direction of the Supreme Court?\n\nSUTTON: Well, the point that I was going to make is I wasn't involved.  That's the Seminole Tribe case that makes \nthat ruling that made that decision that the eleventh amendment does apply to states and that the only way \nCongress can alter that immunity is through Section 5 legislation or spending clause legislation.  I was not involved \nin arguing Seminole Tribe.  The cases I have done have been principally\u2026\n\n\n\nLEAHY: Are you comfortable with the decisions the Supreme Court has followed?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I'm comfortable that I would follow them as a Court of Appeals judge. Would I have done that as a -\n- you know would I have done that as a Court of Appeals judge had that case faced me? Would I have done that in \nany other position?  I don't know.  I've never been in the position where I had a chance to do what a good judge \nshould do and ask yourself, OK, you know what does one side have to say about this?  What precedent do they \nthink supports them?  What would another side say?\n\nI guess the one part of the decisions that, you know, it's the one part Judge Noonan doesn't deal with is his point \nthat, you know, the doctrine that the king can do no wrong is a bad doctrine.  I think everyone would agree and \nthat's exactly why most democratically elected legislatures have allowed suits against states and the federal \ngovernment.\n\nAnd, the one point I would make to be consistent with him, and he doesn't make it, is that if you're going to say the \nking can do no wrong and there's no such thing as sovereign immunity because the term doesn't appear in the U.S. \nConstitution, it seems to me appropriate that that be true with the United States government because it doesn't \napply there either and, I think that's what the court has done.\n\nNow maybe the U.S. Supreme Court is wrong in these cases but I think they have seen some symmetry in money \ndamages cases being brought against elected, Congress elected (inaudible).\n\nLEAHY: But you understand some of the concerns that many of us up here are suggesting that the states are \nsuddenly being protected from taking responsibility for discrimination, for example, they or their agencies decide to \ndo, or violating other people's copyrights they or their agencies do, that they're protected.  I mean I have to ask \nmyself weren't the civil war veterans, including the fourteenth, designed as an expansion of federal power and \nactually an intrusion into state sovereignty?\n\nSUTTON: Oh, absolutely, and that's exactly why the City of Burnie decision and these other cases allow individuals \nto bring money damages actions against states under the fourteenth amendment because of Section 5 legislation, \nso I agree entirely with that.\n\nLEAHY: But then if that's the case we have also a problem.  I realize you didn't decide the cases but here in the \nCongress where we might have weeks or months of hearings (inaudible) the ADA and RIFRA and ADA bringing in \nevidence not only in hearings here in Washington but appealed hearings around the country and isn't Congress in a \nbetter position to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its Section 5 authority after all those hearings than the \ncourt is after an hour's hearing over in the marble hall across the street?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely and the U.S. Supreme Court has said that you're in a better position to make those findings.  \nYou're better equipped to gather that kind of evidence.\n\nSUTTON: The thing that the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be tricky in this area, and I think it's another area \nJudge Noonan criticized, and reasonable minds can differ on this point, is the question of is it complete deference \nor virtually complete deference to congressional fact findings and, I think the point the U.S. Supreme Court has \nmade and on this point I don't think there is disagreement. I think all nine justices, not applying it in a given case, \nbut I think all nine justices would agree that one can't decide that a congressional fact finding is binding on the \ndetermination of the validity of Section 5 law because that would be to delegate the ultimate Marbury power to this \nbranch of government.  So what -- so I think that that principle is a difficult one.\n\nLEAHY: On that, on the general principle, I would agree with you but I believe we also have a court that is totally \nignoring the legislative record or saying that it's virtually irrelevant.  That's what I mean by a very, very activist \nSupreme Court.\n\nSUTTON: Well, the part that I, you know, I certainly sympathize if not empathize with you on is these decisions are \nrecent rulings. City of Burnie is 1997 or so and many of these laws that were reviewed were enacted before the \nCity of Burnie decision.\n\n\n\nNow, the City of Burnie relies on many existing precedents but it had not dealt with non-voting rights, non-race \ndiscrimination cases, the court had not, and so I certainly understand your position and I think that's what Judge \nNoonan was saying is that it doesn't seem fair to suddenly judge these laws based on a standard that was \ndeveloped after the law.  I think you're right to be skeptical of that.\n\nLEAHY: I look at Justice Breyer's dissent in Garrett.  Things like that I find very compelling.  But my time is up, Mr. \nChairman, and I'll wait for my next round.\n\nHATCH: Senator Schumer, I'll turn to you.\n\nU.S. SENATOR CHARLES E. SCHUMER (D-NY): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank everybody.  I \nknow it's been a long day but I think it's an important day as well, so I'm going to ask a few more questions of \nProfessor Sutton.\n\nNow, a few years back, as you well know, the court, the Supreme Court invalidated part of the Violence Against \nWomen Act holding that Congress did not adequately establish that violence against women had an impact on \ninterstate commerce, and the decision was criticized by many as an incredible incident of judicial activism.\n\nJustice Breyer, one of the four who dissented wrote: \"Since judges can not change the world, it means that within \nthe bounds of the rational Congress not the courts must remain primarily responsible for striking the appropriate \nstate/federal balance.\"\n\nThat to me sounds right.  It seems to me that's exactly what the founders intended.  For better or worse, we're \ncharged with making policy, and the judiciary's role, while just as important, is quite different and yet it appears to \nme that with increasing frequency the courts have tried to become policymaking bodies supplanting court made \njudgments for hours.\n\nThey're the un-elected branch of government.  The founding fathers set them up to interpret, not make the laws, for \na reason and it's not good for our government and it's not good for our country.\n\nNow, I want to read back to you a quote I read earlier, something you said regarding Morrison, which was the case \nin which the court invalidated part of the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nYou said: \"Unexamined deference to the VAWA fact findings would have created another problem as well.  It would \ngive to any congressional staffer with a laptop the ultimate Marbury power, to have the final say over what amounts \nto interstate commerce and thus to what represents the limits on Congress' commerce clause powers.\"\n\nI have to tell you I'm troubled by that statement, very troubled. Senator Biden and I can both tell you a little bit about \nthe record Congress created on VAWA because he was the author in the Senate and I pushed it in the House.  It's \nnot as if we had our counsel sit down at their computers with a couple of beers and make up some congressional \nfindings.\n\nIt's not as if we called our legislative directors and said hey, could you make up some stuff about how when violent \nacts are perpetrated against women it affects their ability to participate in interstate commerce.  You seem, you \nknow, almost contemptuous of the legislative process in your comments.  I think you can make a pretty compelling \ncase without actual studies and testimony simply by using logic that violence against women has a real effect on \ninterstate commerce but that's not just what we did.\n\nIn passing many of the laws the court has struck down, but in particular in passing VAWA.  Because I was involved \nminute-to-minute, you can imagine when I read something like this and see the court saying we didn't have a basis \nfor making the law how infuriating it is because they weren't there.  We were and we took testimony from citizens, \nfrom academics, from state lawmakers, from state attorneys general, and an array of other interested parties.\n\nIt took us years to formulate it, to change it, to test it, to see where it was right and where it was wrong in the \nlegislative process.  We solicited input and received a green light from states on the question of whether there was \n\n\n\na need for the national legislature to act.  The VAWA findings, as I presume you know, were voluminous. I'm not \nsure what more the five justices on the Supreme Court thought we needed to do.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask you this.  Why did you think that the findings underlying VAWA were not enough? What more \ndid Congress need to do to make the record that violence against women has an impact on interstate commerce? \nAnd, if the courts should not give unexamined deference to Congress' findings, what should the standard be?\n\nSUTTON: Thank you, Senator.  I do appreciate having a chance to talk about that case and that brief.  The first \npoint I would make, which I hope you'll respect my making it is it wasn't a brief on my behalf.  It was a brief on \nbehalf of a client and I was doing my best to represent them and I can assure you I would have been happy to \nrepresent the other side in that case and, as a Court of Appeals judge, I would of course follow the U.S. Supreme \nCourt whether it's the Morrison case as is or the case is reversed.\n\nNow, in terms of that statement, I agree with your criticism of it in part and then I disagree with it in part.  The part \nwith which I agree is the line is too rhetorical.  I don't think it actually did advance my client's cause and I regret that.  \nI do think it's a little too rhetorical for good advocacy.\n\nThe part with which I disagree in terms of it being a reasonable position for the state in that case to argue was this \nunderlying issue I was just discussing with Senator Leahy, and that's the issue of the court has said, and they said it \nagain in Morrison and they've said it forever that, of course there's a great presumption of constitutionality to federal \nstatutes, and even more to the fact finding capacity of this body when it comes to determining whether there's a \nsocial problem, whether that problem relates to interstate commerce, whether that problem relates to underlying \nconstitutional violations or discrimination, and I think the court has correctly said that throughout.\n\nI think the part that I slightly disagree with in the suggestion of your question though is that it's somehow wrong to \nsuggest that there's some limit to that deference, that the deference in other words is complete.  I think in the \nMorrison case, Justice Souter, he was the primary dissenter and Justice Breyer joined this part of his dissent, I can't \ntell you the footnote number but there is a footnote where Chief Justice Rehnquist, who wrote the majority opinion, \nand Justice Souter are discussing this deference point, and Justice Souter concedes that the U.S. Supreme Court \ndoes have a role.\n\nAll nine members are agreeing they do have a role in ensuring that the evidence that this body gathered did, in fact, \nconcern interstate commerce and so I think that principal is now within the mainstream.  I'm not aware of a single \njustice that has disagreed with it, and then I think what you're stuck with in Morrison is a terribly challenging, \nexcruciatingly difficult application of that principle.\n\nSCHUMER: Can I just -- I want to let you finish but did you disagree that the evidence we found was dispositive, \nyou may disagree with it but was directed at interstate commerce?  We didn't say count the number of trees in \nMontana and that justifies.  I mean it was all directed at interstate commerce.  We made a case about interstate \ncommerce.\n\nSUTTON: I couldn't agree more that that's what you were trying to do.  I agree.\n\nSCHUMER: Well, then continue.  You just said that there are limits but here there's no dispute that we addressed \nthe issue of interstate commerce.\n\nSUTTON: I'm -- I'm\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: So, explain the ruling to me.  Explain what you think here.  Did you disagree with how we did it?  Did \nwe not do it enough? Was it or is it really that somehow, and this would be different I think than the holding in \nMorrison, that you just didn't think this affected interstate commerce period and it didn't matter if we found that it \ndid?  Your view would supplant ours.\n\nSUTTON: When writing this brief for this client, again as an advocate, I didn't -- the issue for me wasn't agreeing or \ndisagreeing. That wasn't why I was hired to tell them.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: I want to know what you think.\n\nSUTTON: Well, that was not an exercise I went through and I have no idea, Senator, what I would have done had \nthat been a case I had been a Court of Appeals judge on.\n\nSCHUMER: But do you think we tried to address interstate commerce when we made the findings in terms of \nVAWA or not?\n\nSUTTON: Oh, of course you were. I repeat what I said earlier. You were trying to reach, you were trying to establish \na factual record that established that the terrible results of gender related crimes, gender violence related crimes \nhave impacts on interstate commerce and nothing in that brief said Congress wasn't trying to do that.\n\nWhat the brief made the point, again on behalf of a client, was that the theory of the Congress' views that it was \nrelated to interstate commerce was a theory that would apply to the regulation of all matters, family law matters, all \ncriminal law issues.  And, while someone could disagree with that, in fact I'm sure reasonable minds would \ndisagree with it, I can't imagine not making that argument as an advocate on behalf of that client.  I mean the client \nwas entitled to the best representation.\n\nSCHUMER: Sir, in all due respect, aside from advocating for the client, what you're seeming, you know, you're sort \nof you're saying all this work I did and everyone you know, it's almost like we're in 1984 here because your views on \nfederalism are not just advocating for clients.  You've become a leading -- you write articles.  The things you \nadvocate, the pro bono cases are not in keeping with what your general activities and beliefs are, most, many of \nthem.\n\nThis is -- I want to read from an article you wrote, not advocating for a client, advocating for yourself.  This is from \nthe Review of Federalism and Separation of Powers Law, and let me read it because it says the exact same thing, \nand these are your views signed by you, and I think you're hiding behind the client thing and we're not having a real \ndebate on the issue here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPlease, that's not fair because everyone knows how you feel on this and you know how you feel on this.  That \ndoesn't mean as a judge maybe you couldn't change but these are not just views you advocated for a client.  These \nare deeply held views by you, I would believe, from looking at the whole record and it would be awfully hard to \ndisprove it.\n\nHere's what you wrote.  \"The necessary stacking of one inference on top of another required to connect an \ninterstate rate to an active interstate commerce had no fathomable limit the court held.  Once accepted, only the \nmost unimaginative lawyer would lack the resources to contend that all manner of in state activities will have the \nrippling effects that ultimately affect commerce.\n\nSuch an approach would have a disfiguring effect on the constitutional balance between states and national \ngovernment, and would indeed make the tenth amendment but a truism, and would ultimately make irrelevant every \nother delegation of power to act under Article 1.  Unexamined deference to the VAWA fact findings would have \ncreated another problem as well.\"\n\nAnd, here's the regretful phrase.  \"It would give to any congressional staffer with a laptop the ultimate Marbury \npower, to have a final say over what amounts to interstate commerce.\" You may have said that in the brief, I don't \nknow, but you said it separately under your own ten, under your own articles, so you can't say well you were saying \nthat just on behalf of a client.  Those at one point, I don't know if they still are, are your views.  Are they still?\n\nSUTTON: Senator, I do think a lawyer who is representing a client does have a prerogative to write an article.  This \nactually was not an article about this case.  It was an article about several decisions saying that the court got it right \nwhen it ruled on (inaudible).\n\n\n\nObviously, the opposite was not true.  I did not have the alternative to say publicly that the court got it wrong after \narguing on behalf of the state in that particular case.  I mean my ethical duty would have precluded that.  But I want \nto go back to what I was trying to say earlier.  No one disagrees on the Supreme Court anyway\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: So wait, can I just again because there's a lot of sophistry here, do you believe that unexamined \ndeference to VAWA would give any congressional staffer with a laptop the ultimate Marbury power?  Do you, \nJeffrey Sutton?\n\nSUTTON: I have not\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Not as a representative, not as a lawyer representing someone, but as a professor, as somebody who \nhas written articles, as somebody who is well known to have a strong view on these issues?\n\nSUTTON: Well, as I said earlier, I have no idea what I would do as a judge because I have no idea what a judge\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: (inaudible).\n\nSUTTON: Well, you asked what I believed and I'm telling you.\n\nSCHUMER: I didn't ask what you'd do as a judge.  I asked what you as Professor Jeffrey Sutton not representing a \nclient, do you believe this phrase or not, this -- I mean, you know, I've written things. I've changed my mind later.\n\nSUTTON: Right.\n\nSCHUMER: So, I'm not\u2026\n\nSUTTON: Actually, I think it's very consistent with something I said earlier today.  I'm not sure if you were here at \nthe time.  Yes, I do believe in the principle of federalism in the sense that there is a principal that says on a \nseparation of powers basis.\n\nSUTTON: There are checks and balances, horizontally among the federal branch of the government, this body, the \nU.S. Supreme Court and the president and vertically between the national government and the states.  That's a \nprincipal that's embedded in the constitution and there are countless U.S. Supreme Court cases that recognize it.\n\nAnd, the statement that you have just quoted makes the point, and this is what I perceive the court is trying to do.  \nNow maybe one could disagree that this is what they did, but is making the point that as long as that court has the \nMarbury power, and perhaps people could disagree with it, but as long as they have that power they have not just \nthe power but a duty to review even the most exhaustive fact findings of this body.\n\nAnd, the reason I'm not comfortable telling you my view on whether those findings related to interstate commerce or \nnot is I just am not familiar enough to say that.  That's just not something I could tell you.\n\nSCHUMER: Would you say that again?  You're not familiar enough with what?\n\nSUTTON: With all of the issues in the case to make that point. I was hired by a client to make one side of the \nargument.  I've never had the opportunity to sit back and say objectively what would you do, Jeff, with this particular \nissue.\n\nSCHUMER: You wrote this in an article professing a viewpoint, your viewpoint.\n\nSUTTON: And I'm just telling you that stands for the principle that the national government, as broad as its powers \nare, they do have limitations, and I would say but the broader point, Senator, is had I been asked by the other side \nin that case to argue that case, I can assure you I would have done it.\n\nSCHUMER: That's not what I'm asking and please don't keep bringing that up.  We know that you're a very \nsuccessful, persuasive advocate, and we know you've advocated in different positions.  You wrote an article where \n\n\n\nyou said the exact same thing as in brief.  You first told me it's just because you were advocating for a client. Now, I \nhave an article here where you wrote it again.\n\nYou didn't say, as I argued in, or as was argued in.  You professed the belief as yours and now you're saying, \nyou're not giving me an answer whether you believed it at the time and still believe it now.\n\nSUTTON: But I do think I did answer.\n\nSCHUMER: I didn't ask you what you'd do as a judge.  I know as a judge you would have to examine both sides.  I \nunderstand that.  My knowledge isn't as great as yours in terms of jurisprudence but I know that much.\n\nSUTTON: I'm sorry.\n\nSCHUMER: But I also know that I feel very strongly that it's my obligation and your responsibility to let people know \nyour views because they will influence how you are as a judge.  I know that there are a lot of people who say, oh \nno, every judge will make the same decision, but then we would have all 9-0 decisions and every one of the circuits \nwould be the same.\n\nAnd, in terms of studies, those appointed by Democratic presidents and those appointed by Republican presidents \nwould come out the same - not the same way but in the same percentage way and we all know that's not true.\n\nAnd, if I've tried to do anything in the last year it's to break through this (inaudible) that philosophy doesn't matter.  \nAnd, by the way, if philosophy didn't matter, the White House would send us a far broader panoply of judges in \nterms of their views than they do without any question.\n\nAnd so, we should be discussing this.  We should be discussing this issue honestly not hiding behind \nrepresentation, not hiding and saying well I don't know what I think.  Most of us on this panel, I believe, know you \nknow what you think on this but you refuse to discuss it, even though you wrote an article saying it.\n\nSUTTON: Well, again, first of all Senator I respect your views on this and I've been paying attention to them the last \ncouple of years and I certainly understand the seriousness of the issue.  I guess I feel I disagree with what you're \nsaying in terms of my refusing to answer the question about this article.  I did write the article.  It was obviously a \nrecycling of the brief as proved by the fact it quotes the exact language of the brief.  I do think there is a lawyer's \nprerogative\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Quoted it as your own, not representing a client.\n\nSUTTON: Exactly and I'm making the point, a lawyer has a prerogative having argued a case to say that the court \ngot it right. That's exactly what I did and I can't tell you that that's the right decision. How could I possibly say that \nto you given how much respect I have for the role of a Court of Appeals judge and what their job is when it comes to \ndeciding what they would do with a given case?  And, I think it would be just the opposite of what that judge's role is \nto say oh, I could tell you what I'd do with that kind of a case.  I couldn't tell you that.\n\nSCHUMER: Could I ask you to do this within the week?  Could I ask you to review the Congress' findings in VAWA \nand tell us whether you agree, you personally, not representing anyone, whether you agree with the majority or \nminority's findings or someplace in between?\n\nHATCH: Well, let me just interrupt.  I also was a prime sponsor in the Senate.  It was the Biden-Hatch Bill.  Those \nmaterials are so voluminous.  No, come on let's quit asking what he is going to do as a judge or what he believes.  \nLet's talk in terms of\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Well, Mr. Chairman, in all due respect of course I want to know what he's going to do as a judge. So \ndoes everybody.\n\nHATCH: OK, well I agree with that.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: It's not some kind of mathematical formula that every judge, just depending on their intellectual power \nof\u2026\n\nHATCH: But you're seeming to want a foregone conclusion from him.\n\nSCHUMER: No, I don't.  I want\u2026\n\nHATCH: And he's not willing to give that to you.\n\nSCHUMER: I want to know his views, not what his client's views are, and not how persuasive an advocate he is.\n\nHATCH: But he's making the point that his views are irrelevant when he becomes a judge.\n\nSCHUMER: And I don't think anyone really believes that.\n\nHATCH: That may be but that's what\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Or (inaudible)\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHATCH: Now, let's understand something.\n\nSCHUMER: Right.\n\nHATCH: I'm going to clear this room.\n\nSCHUMER: Please.\n\nHATCH: Something that I've made possible for everybody if we continue to have these outbursts.  First of all, it's \nnot fair to anybody.  It's not fair to the witness.  It's not fair to the Senators up here.  We're supposed to have some \ndecorum here and I expect this proceeding to be treated with dignity.  Now, let's just remember that. I respect all of \nyou but I want no more outbursts.\n\nSCHUMER: And I'd say in all due respect it doesn't help my case when you\u2026 If I might on that, Mr. Chairman, I've \nserved as chairman of numerous committees and subcommittees as have you.\n\nHATCH: Right.\n\nLEAHY: And we must have decorum.  I know that feelings are very strong here.  I agree with the feelings of many \nwho have expressed it here, but we also have three witnesses who are answering questions under oath, Senators \nwho are working to ask them, and the only way we're going to do this is through decorum.  So, I will support the \nchairman and maintain the decorum, and especially as I said before, I appreciate the chairman taking the \nrecommendation of myself and others to move down here so that everybody could be accommodated.\n\nHATCH: Thank you, I appreciate that.\n\nSCHUMER: Mr. Chairman, my time, you've been very generous in time and I would still ask, if he decides he \nwishes to, to ask Professor Sutton to let me know his views on whether the majority was correct in finding that \nCongress in its findings didn't really justify a reach into interstate commerce in Morrison.  You don't have to do that \nnow.  I'll ask you to do it in a written question.\n\nBefore I conclude, Mr. Chairman, I have some more questions and I know it's been a long day, and I do want to \nthank you Mr. Sutton.  My questions are strong but they're not personal and they're heartfelt as your answers are \nand I respect that.\n\nSUTTON: I can believe that.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: And I guess, Mr. Chairman, I have to go to two other places.  I have more questions of Mr. Sutton and I \nhaven't even begun to ask questions of either Mr. Roberts or Judge Cook (ph). And so, I would simply ask that we \nat least come back at another point in time and be able to ask.  I think it would not be fair to us if we didn't get a \nchance to ask Mr. Roberts and Judge Cook questions at another time.\n\nHATCH: Well, unfortunately I can't do that.  In other words, this is the hearing and frankly we'll keep the record open \nfor questions, and Senator Leahy has already asked that we make sure we get a transcript of the record so that \nmore questions could be asked. But no, we're going to finish the hearing today. Now, I hope that we can \naccommodate you to come back and ask any further questions you'd like.\n\nSCHUMER: You know, Mr\u2026 I'm going to appeal the ruling of the chair.  I don't think it's fair.  These questions are \nnot frivolous.\n\nHATCH: No, they're not.\n\nSCHUMER: And I would appeal the ruling of the chair and ask for a roll call vote that we finish with Professor \nSutton today as long as it takes but we come back and ask both Mr. Roberts and Judge Cook questions.\n\nHATCH: Not fair to them.  I'm prepared to sit here as long as it takes within reason.  I mean I think there's a point \nwhere you have to call the end of the hearing.  But this is today's hearing.  These people have sat here patiently \nnow for how many hours is it, since 9:30 this morning, and we're going to finish this today.\n\nAnd I notice that Mr. Sutton's three kids, they're the best kids I've ever seen and they haven't raised a fuss here at \nall.  I just want to compliment your wife and you for the wonderful children you have.  But I want to be fair but, on \nthe other hand, Mr. Roberts has been waiting 11 years.\n\nSCHUMER: In all due respect, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: The other two have been waiting almost two years.  I think it's up to us to ask the questions here today and \nI'm providing the time to do so, and I'm also providing an additional time to ask written questions, a reasonable time, \nbut not an unreasonable time. We're going to finish this today.\n\nSCHUMER: In all due respect, we're having a third hearing on Pickering.  We're having a second hearing on \nOwens.\n\nHATCH: I don't know what I'm going to do about it.\n\nSCHUMER: The ones who we defeated, they get all the hearing time you want to change the record but we don't \nhave a full opportunity with Mr. Roberts to the second most important court in the land, with Judge Cook in terms of \na circuit, the Sixth Circuit.\n\nHATCH: But you do.\n\nSCHUMER: That we kept open for a long period of time.\n\nHATCH: I'm not prepared to leave.\n\nSCHUMER: It is not fair.  Well, it is not fair.\n\nHATCH: When can you come back, Senator, for your further questions?  I'll be happy to be here.\n\nSCHUMER: I can come back later this evening.\n\nHATCH: Great.\n\nSCHUMER: But I don't know if my colleagues can and I've never seen this kind of thing happen.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, it's going to happen.\n\nSCHUMER: We have never had three Court of Appeals judges on one panel.  We knew that Professor Sutton in \nparticular would take a great deal of questioning.\n\nHATCH: And he has.\n\nSCHUMER: And I don't think it's right.  I don't think it's fair.\n\nHATCH: Senator, if you need more time take it right now.  I'll be glad to give it to you but the point is I'm not going \nto mistreat these people either.\n\nSCHUMER: Well.\n\nHATCH: I mean, my gosh, they've been waiting for two years, Mr. Roberts 11 years.  We've made them available.  \nThey've been here since 9:30 this morning and I think it's only fair that if you have questions you ask them.\n\nSCHUMER: OK.\n\nHATCH: Now you might have a schedule that's different.  I can't help that.\n\nSCHUMER: Well.\n\nHATCH: I mean there's a lot of things I've had to forego today and some I've just had to do, but the fact of the \nmatter is, is that that's what we have those hearings for.\n\nSCHUMER: I appeal the ruling of the chair and ask for a roll call.\n\nHATCH: Well, I reject the appeal.\n\nSCHUMER: I ask for a vote.\n\nHATCH: Well, this isn't a formal committee markup.  You can bring it up tomorrow in a vote and I'll be happy to \nhave you appeal the ruling of the chair and we'll vote on it tomorrow.  I don't know what rule you're talking about.\n\nSCHUMER: I thought that, Mr. Chairman, when the chair rules this way you can appeal the ruling of the chair at a \nhearing as well as at a markup.\n\nHATCH: Not that I know of.\n\nSCHUMER: Well, could we ask counsel to rule on that?\n\nHATCH: Well.\n\nSCHUMER: Parliamentarian.\n\nHATCH: We'll check with the parliamentarian but I will defer that ruling in any event as chairman until tomorrow and \nwe'll have the vote tomorrow, and if you win, I guess I'll have to come back.  The fact of the matter is\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: So, in other words, if you want to ask questions you can stay all night but you can defer a vote of the \npeople who don't want to ask questions?\n\nHATCH: No, no Senator Schumer. There's a reasonable time that is given for hearings.  I am prepared to sit here.  I \nwill give you more time right now.  I will give you more time within a reasonable time after right now.  But this is the \ntime to ask your questions, and I would like you to do it.\n\nIf you don't want to that's your privilege. If you don't want to ask oral questions, then submit written questions and \nwe'll have them answer them within reason.  But these folks have been under the impression that this is their \n\n\n\nhearing and it is, and it's been a long, lengthy one, and I expect it's going to still be fairly lengthy.  But I'll be happy \nto give you more time right now, Senator Schumer.  I have no problem with that.\n\nSCHUMER: Mr. Chairman, this is one of the reasons that\u2026\n\nHATCH: And I've already given you 21 minutes.\n\nSCHUMER: Oh, you've been generous each time I've been here.\n\nHATCH: Well, and I'll continue to be.\n\nSCHUMER: Let me say this.  We don't even have rules in this committee yet.  We haven't passed rules of how the \ncommittee works. We're already rushing to do three Court of Appeals justices at once, and I just don't think it's the \nfair way to run this committee.\n\nHATCH: Well, I apologize to you because I do think it's a fair way and I think it has to be done and I don't think we \ncan keep delaying these people and putting it off.  They're making themselves available.  I'm giving you more time if \nyou need it.\n\nSCHUMER: Mr. Chairman, in all due respect, this is a lifetime appointment, a very important court\u2026\n\nHATCH: Well, it doesn't have to be a lifetime hearing, I'll tell you that.\n\nSCHUMER: And if nominees are not willing to wait an extra day or two to be questioned openly and fairly, I wonder \nabout that.\n\nHATCH: I'm not willing to put them through that.  We're here. Let's have the hearing and let's finish.\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Chairman.  Several of us have spoken prior to this hearing of concern of having three controversial \nCourts of Appeals judges all in the same day rather than having day-by-day or however you might want to do it.  \nYou've spoken of Mr. Roberts waiting for 11 years.  Looking at Mr. Roberts, he must have been about 20 years old \nat the time he was first nominated.\n\nBut, you also recall that Mr. Roberts was with a number of people who were nominated within the so-called Strom \nThurmond rule, which means that most nominations after a certain period of time in a presidential election year are \nnot heard.  This is an extraordinary circumstance.\n\nAnd you'll also recall, and I was here at the time, that there was no really great push by the White House or other \nRepublican leadership to make an exception for Mr. Roberts, partly because they were convinced that President \nBush was going to get reelected easily and they'd bring him up the following January.\n\nLEAHY: I see Mr. Roberts smiling.  He probably heard some of that at the time.  I'm not putting you on the spot but \njust so everybody understands that the Strom Thurmond rule which has been followed in this for the nearly 30 years \nI've been here is that the president, Republican or Democrat, except for extraordinary circumstances, we have \nmade some exceptions, does not get a nominee through after about July or so in a presidential election year.\n\nSenator Biden did put through a number for President Bush that year but they were the ones that the White House \nreally pushed very hard for.  Professor Sutton, Mr. Roberts, and Judge Cook, were first nominated while you were \nchairman of this committee and were there for a couple months before the control of the Senate and nobody \nbrought them up at that time.\n\nSo, this is not a case, I mean I just want to get all the facts on the table.  Another day or so to be able to complete \nan adequate hearing and have an adequate hearing record for the Senate does not do the nominees bad nor does \nit hurt the Senate.\n\nHATCH: Well, I've been prepared to finish the hearing today. I'm prepared to do it.  I'm prepared to give you more \ntime, Senator Schumer, and I'd be glad to do it out of order or any way you'd like to have it, but we're going to finish \n\n\n\nthe hearing tonight and go from there and, I think it's only fair to the nominees.  I think it's fair to Senators.  We have \nto adjust our schedules to be able to be here and participate.  It certainly would be fair to the chairman too who's \nhad a whole raft of things I've had to ignore all day long, some of them very, very important as well.\n\nLEAHY: Even I've had important\u2026\n\nHATCH: And even the ranking member has had to do that.  So, I apologize.  I hate to have you feel badly about it \nbut that's the way it's going to be.\n\nSenator Feingold?\n\nU.S. SENATOR RUSSELL D. FEINGOLD (D-WI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Obviously, I've been following this \ndiscussion and I just have to add before I start my round that this highlights exactly the problem that we pointed out \nat the outset of the hearing.  This isn't one day long enough to question three controversial nominees, and \nobviously we shouldn't forget that we have three District Court nominees on the agenda.\n\nHATCH: Senator, would you yield for just a second.  I feel badly about this but I've asked for a little bit of leeway by \nmy colleagues because I think it's time that we bite the bullet and do what's right with regard to at least these three \nnominees.  I've been listening to my colleagues all day.  I don't think there's been an unfair thing.  I certainly made \nmyself available. We've certainly allowed all the questions.  We're prepared to sit for longer within a reasonable \ntime.\n\nBut I do think there has to be some consideration to the people who are nominated too.  It's now been 630 days \nsince they were nominated, and in the case of Mr. Roberts, 11 years, and three times. Now, I think there comes a \ntime when we've got to put partisan politics aside, and I haven't seen a glove laid on these people all day long for all \nof the desire to question them, and I've seen tremendous answers and tremendous abilities displayed here.  And \nthere comes a time we've got to say hey look, it's the end of the hearing.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman\u2026\n\nHATCH: I think today is the day and I've made that clear from the beginning.  I've asked for some help from the \nminority.  I've asked for some leeway here and I hope that you'll give it.  If you don't, we're going to end this today.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman, I regret that\u2026 Mr. Chairman\u2026\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman, I would like to raise a question.  I thought it might have been my time next.  \nSenator Schumer had 20 minutes.  I kept my time within my limit. Others on the other side have gone over.  I think \nyou've bent over backwards beyond belief to be fair.  If Senator Feingold is ready to go now I'll wait, but I just think \nyou've been as fair as can possibly be, and if you want to let the other side have their say right now, I'm willing to \nyield.\n\nHATCH: Well, our side has been willing to defer so that the Democrat side can ask the questions that they want to, \nand I want to be fair.  Everybody knows that I am and frankly that's why we have a hearing.  Usually these hearings \ngo for about two hours.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, Mr. Chairman\u2026\n\nHATCH: We've been here since 9:30.  It's now 5:30 almost.  Go ahead, Senator.  I'm sorry to interrupt.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I regret the fact that these three nominees have to sit all day through this but, you know, \nfrankly the problem is, and I've been on this committee only for eight years.  That doesn't compare to you, Mr. \nChairman, but I've never seen this done. I've never seen - and the idea that the hearings on controversial Court of \nAppeals judges are only two hours, that is not the case. That is now what I've witnessed here.\n\nThe serious hearings about very important appointments like this take much longer.  They usually take all day, and \nfrankly Mr. Sutton should have been the one for all day today, and I don't think people have been dilatory.  These \n\n\n\nquestions are reasonable and I'll just say it one more time that, you know, I do have tremendous respect for you. \nThis procedure today really does trouble me.\n\nHATCH: If the Senator would yield.  I remember a time and I have been on this committee, this is my 27th year, I \nremember a time when Senator Biden had three and I don't remember any griping about it because we want to fill \nthese benches.  These are emergency positions, and frankly I'm willing to be here, and I think it's incumbent upon \nour colleagues to be here and ask their questions.  And like I say, my side is deferring so that you can, and\u2026\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman\u2026\n\nHATCH: Now, look let me say one other thing.  I really respect you.  You've always been honest.  You've always \nbeen straightforward. You're very intelligent.  You're a great lawyer and I respect your feelings but respect mine too.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do.\n\nHATCH: I'm just trying to do my job as the chairman.  I'm trying to fill these courts and I haven't seen anything \nwrong here today. These three nominees have been excellent.  But in any event you have to make up your own \nmind but there has to be a time when you bring these things to conclusion.\n\nToday is the day we bring this hearing to conclusion and everybody knew that before we started, and if people just \nwant to ask questions of Mr. Sutton, although we've had questions of all three, then that's your privilege, but my \ngosh, I'm providing means whereby you can ask questions of others.  Please start his clock over because I've used \nhis time.\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Chairman, could I make a suggestion before you start the clock?'\n\nHATCH: Yes.\n\nLEAHY: Usually you and I have been able to find a rational way out of such impasses.  Could I suggest that we, \nand the members who are here, could we recess for about five minutes and we talk privately?  You lose nothing by \nthat nor do we.\n\nHATCH: All we lose is time, right.\n\nLEAHY: And, it's been a long day.  It's going to be a long evening.  Why don't we just talk privately out of the \nhearing of the room?  I mean you're the chairman.  It's whatever you want, but I would suggest we do that.  You and \nI have almost always been able to work things out.\n\nHATCH: I think that's a reasonable request.  We'll recess for five minutes and then we'll resume, but we're going to \nfinish this today.\n\n(RECESS)\n\nHATCH: OK, we'll turn to Senator Feingold.\n\nFEINGOLD: Mr. Chairman, again I very much enjoy working with you.\n\nHATCH: Likewise.\n\nFEINGOLD: But the record does need to reflect my concern, the concern of many members that this process today \nreally was not a fair process, although you are generally very fair in your leadership of this committee.  I just want \nthe record to reflect that many of us believe that these nominees are controversial and to be sure that there's not a \nprecedent for the future based on the claim that Senator Biden had done this in the past.\n\nThe fact is when Senator Biden had three Court of Appeals nominees at the same hearing, they were as a courtesy \nto the previous Bush administration and they were non-controversial.  So, let the record reflect that this should not \n\n\n\nbe a precedent for future attempts to have three significant, controversial, Court of Appeals nominations put forward \nat the same time.\n\nHATCH: Will the Senator yield?\n\nFEINGOLD: I think it's a very bad process and precedent for this committee.\n\nHATCH: Will the Senator yield on that point? I agree that it is extraordinary to have three Circuit Court nominees.  \nIt's been done before.  Senator Biden did it and I think it's not a precedent we should avoid, but it has caused a \ngreat deal of concern among my colleagues and I will certainly try to be more considerate in the future but I would \nlike to finish this tonight if we can, and I believe we can, in fact we're going to.\n\nAnd, I appreciate my fair colleague.  You've always been fair. You've always been decent to me and I think you're \nbeing decent again, and we respectfully disagree on this, but I will try to take your feelings very deeply into \nconsideration in the future.\n\nFEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll go to Mr. Sutton again. In response to my earlier question about the \nSwank case, you told me that you hadn't really made a direct argument that the migratory bird rule violated the \nConstitution.\n\nSUTTON: No, I don't think I did.  I said we made a constitutional avoidance argument and then raised the \nconstitutional issues that would be implicated if the court couldn't deal with this on statutory construction grounds.\n\nFEINGOLD: Right, you said you'd only made an argument on what you called constitutional avoidance, and we \nactually looked up the amicus brief here filed on behalf of the State of Alabama.  The entire second half of the brief, \nsix pages out of a total of ten pages of argument, is an argument with the following heading: The regulation \nexceeds Congress' commerce clause powers.\n\nIn other words, you made a constitutional argument, not simply a statutory interpretation argument, based on the \nDoctrine of Constitutional Avoidance, is that correct?\n\nSUTTON: It is correct, Senator, but maybe my earlier testimony was misapprehended or maybe I misspoke.  I'm \nsure the odds are better that I misspoke.  One can't make a constitutional avoidance argument without making a \nconstitutional argument.  I mean in other words it's not - if one said to a court that you want to construe a statute in \nthis way to avoid a constitutional issue, I can't imagine a lawyer not then arguing the constitutional issue (inaudible).\n\nFEINGOLD: I don't think that's the point that I'm trying to raise.  I appreciate that.  I do understand that yours was \nthe only amicus brief that took this position, so I want to get directly to the constitutional issue.\n\nI wanted to give you an opportunity to supplement your answer to my earlier question, and so let me add the \nfollowing direct question before you respond.  Do you personally believe the assertion in the State of Alabama's \namicus brief that the migratory bird rule exceeds Congress' commerce clause power?  Do you personally believe it \ndoes?\n\nSUTTON: I have no idea.  You know I obviously was not involved in the underlying litigation that generated the \nSwank case that ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court.  I wasn't involved in it in the lower court, and I simply \nhad a client who was interested in making that argument and I helped them make that argument.  I was never - I \ncan't imagine working for a client and assuming my job was to tell them first what the right answer was, and then \nacting as their lawyer.\n\nThe way I saw my job, and still see my job as a lawyer, is if a client asks me to do something, find all reasonable \narguments that can be made to support their position.  I've done that.  You should know this is not the only \nenvironmental case.  I've helped environmental cases on the other side of the issues.\n\nThere's a case that came out of Ohio, the Sierra Club case, which dealt with logging and timberlands, and while I \ndidn't argue the case for the lawyer, I wasn't even a lawyer in the case, I did help the lawyer who argued on behalf \n\n\n\nof the Sierra Club in that case in getting ready for the U.S. Supreme Court argument and participated in the moot \ncourt with him.\n\nSo, this is another situation where I've been on both sides of these issues as a lawyer, and it wasn't a question of \npersonal views. I didn't decide in the Sierra Club case this is something I'm going to do because I have personal \nviews.  This is something I'm going to do to help someone arguing a case and likewise with the Swank case.\n\nFEINGOLD: All right, well let me move on to a different area then.  You filed an amicus brief on behalf of Los \nAngeles County in the California State Association of Counties in the Buchanan, Border and Keerhall Mink v. West \nVirginia Department of Health and Human Resources (ph).  Do you recall that case?\n\nSUTTON: I do.\n\nFEINGOLD: As you will recall, the Buchanan facility sued the state alleging a violation of the Fair Housing \nAmendments Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, after being forced to close for not meeting a self \npreservation requirement of its residents as defined in state law.\n\nIn response to the suit but before the court ruled, the state legislature illuminated the self preservation requirement.  \nThat gave Buchanan all the relief it sought.  The District Court dismissed the case as moot, but then ruled that \nBuchanan could not be considered a prevailing party in the case, and therefore could not recover its attorneys' fees.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit, contrary to the rulings of every other circuit that addressed the issue affirmed.  The Supreme \nCourt ruled 5- 4 that under the various attorneys' fee statutes, plaintiffs may recover attorneys' fees from defendants \nonly if they have been awarded relief by a court, not if they prevailed through a voluntary change in the defendant's \nbehavior or a private settlement.\n\nSo, this is a narrow interpretation of the definition of prevailing party, which I think has potentially disastrous \nimplications for people whose civil rights have been violated but who can not afford to hire a lawyer.  In calculating \nwhether to take the case, an attorney for a plaintiff will have to consider not only the chances of losing, but the \nchances of winning too easily.\n\nEven if a plaintiff secures a complete victory by getting a defendant to admit to wrongdoing or prompting a change \nin the statute, the attorney who labored for years to bring about such a victory would not be paid at all.\n\nIn the amicus brief you filed in Buchanan, you argued in your words that as a \"matter of mundane litigation realities\" \na narrow definition of prevailing party would prevent parties from \"commencing time consuming satellite litigation \nover fee awards.\"\n\nI want you to know I agree that litigation over fees is something to be minimized, but I would argue that a much \nmore important interest to be furthered is the ability of aggrieved parties to find attorneys who will take their cases.  \nThe court's interpretation of prevailing party potentially prevents people from seeking protection guaranteed to them \nunder existing civil rights laws, and the mundane litigation realities might actually point in the other direction.\n\nA decision could, in fact, force attorneys to drag out lawsuits to keep going, to make sure that they get a judicial \norder rather than accepting a non-judicial settlement that give their clients everything they seek.\n\nSo, let me ask you, do you believe that a person who has a legitimate claim of civil rights violations should be able \nto seek redress in court?\n\nSUTTON: Of course.\n\nFEINGOLD: Do you believe that people's legitimate civil rights claims should have the ability to secure adequate \ncounsel to pursue those claims?\n\nSUTTON: Of course.\n\n\n\nFEINGOLD: Isn't that why Congress enacted statutes giving successful plaintiffs the rights to collect attorneys' \nfees?\n\nSUTTON: I think that is -- I think it's 42 USC 1998, I think that is the purpose of it.  I agree with you.\n\nFEINGOLD: Then how will a person with a legitimate claim be able to get adequate counsel in a case that could \ntake months or even years to resolve when defendants can avoid the possibility of paying attorneys' fees by simply \noffering the plaintiff everything they want before trial?\n\nIn other words, explain to me how the Buchanan decision, which you argued for in your amicus brief, can be \nsquared with a desire to encourage the enforcement of the civil rights laws and other statutes in which Congress \nhas made a judgment that attorneys' fees should be available?\n\nSUTTON: Yes. Well, first of all, you know, I think this is an important issue and I'd like to think the brief I wrote on \nbehalf of the client Los Angeles County is a longstanding Jones Day client. They obviously get sued a lot so that's \nwhy we wrote the brief on their behalf.\n\nAnd, you know, as a board member of the Equal Justice Foundation, who's, you know, 90 percent of their revenue \ncomes from attorneys' fees, I can tell you that I am sensitive to this issue and hope, I think the legislation you've \nproposed to correct the Buchanan decision is correct, is successful, because it will certainly help EJF when it \ncomes to raising funds.\n\nThe issue in that case was a statutory one of whether the term prevailing, prevailing was the key word, and the \ndifficulty which led the Fourth Circuit to go one way and the other Courts of Appeals to rule the other way was \nwhether someone had prevailed, when in fact there wasn't a court judgment indicating this but simply a change in \nconduct.\n\nAnd, I fully appreciate your point, which is my lord, if that's the rule then a litigant, a recalcitrant state or city \nengaging in civil rights violations can simply stop their conduct after litigating for many years, change their rule, and \nnot only have the case dismissed but not owe any attorney fee awards.  Precisely because I was -- I appreciated \nthe very point you've raised at the end of the brief that we offered for Los Angeles County, we dealt with this issue.\n\nFEINGOLD: Then why in your Buchanan brief you asserted that \"precedent confirms\" your interpretation of the \nattorneys' fees statute, yet you failed to bring to the attention of the court the decisions of nine Court of Appeals that \ncontradicted your position?\n\nSUTTON: Well\u2026\n\nFEINGOLD: Didn't you have an obligation to make the court aware of these decisions, especially in light of the fact \nthat you indicated that you believe that the law should allow a litigant to be able to settle a case at an appropriate \ntime and still get attorneys' fees?\n\nSUTTON: It's very rare in U.S. Supreme Court briefs that I have relied on Court of Appeals decisions in general, so \nthat I would say that's just typical of me and cuts across cases and issues.  But the point I wanted to address, which \nyou raised, and I think it's a critical one is what about the recalcitrant city or state that suddenly stops their conduct?  \nAre they now scott free from liability, attorney fee liability?  And, I think your concern is a valid one.\n\nAnd, we indicated in the brief, we raised this very point. In fact, I think it's in the last couple pages of the brief, and \nsaid that's not necessarily true.  We made the point of concession for a county, which is sued all the time, that if \nthere's a case -- gosh it's a Justice Ginsburg decision.  It may be Laidlaw.  We cite it in the back of our brief.\n\nIt makes the point that just because a litigant, a city or state, stops its conduct that doesn't necessarily moot the \ncase because of the possibility they may do it again, or as you're suggesting the possibility they're just trying to hide \nfrom attorney fees.\n\n\n\nSo, I'd like to think -- I obviously had a client's perspective to represent.  I did my best to represent it but I felt like we \nwere actually trying to address that very important consideration in the brief and I do think it was within the \nmainstream to argue the point on behalf of them as a client.  And, as you well know, it can be -- this ambiguity can \nquickly be clarified by legislation.\n\nFEINGOLD: I thank you, Mr. Sutton.  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Do you need more time, Senator Feingold? Okay, thank you.  Senator Leahy.\n\nLEAHY: Professor Sutton, I would suggest, I would urge you to go back and re-read Judge Noonan's book.  I have \nno question that with your mental ability you probably can recite most of it verbatim.\n\nBut I think that again I can't tell you how much many of us are concerned that we have a very activist Supreme \nCourt that determined that the Congress is basically irrelevant and our feelings are basically irrelevant, and you're \ngoing to have a number of cases, they're going to come to you as a first impression if you're confirmed to this \nposition.  Well, obviously I can't tell you how one would rule, but I would like you to at least consider that.\n\nSUTTON: Could I respond to that?\n\nLEAHY: Of course, of course.\n\nSUTTON: I can assure you over the last two years, I have thought a lot about the very perspective all of you have.  \nThis is obviously not a Democratic/Republican issue.  This is an institutional issue and, you know, when one is \ncriticized, as I have been for advocating those cases, you know I really have thought a lot about the other \nperspective, and I do think there are very recent criticisms of those decision but I do think they're difficult decisions.\n\nThey always are when the court is asked to referee boundary disputes between branches of government.  And so, I \ncan assure that if I were fortunate enough to be confirmed, I really would consider the perspective this body has \nwhen it comes to passing laws in the first instance, when it comes to gathering evidence establishing whether \nthere's a policy issue to be addressed, or when it comes to determining whether there are underlying constitutional \nissues that need to be remedied.\n\nLEAHY: Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I just started my time.  I have other questions but Senator Durbin has been in \nand out of the Intelligence Committee.  I'd rather -- I'm going to be here anyway and I'm just wondering if Senator \nDurbin\u2026\n\nHATCH: We'll be happy to (inaudible).  Senator Durbin, go ahead.\n\nLEAHY: I guess I'm going to\u2026\n\nHATCH: Go ahead.\n\nU.S. SENATOR RICHARD J. DURBIN (D-IL): Justice Cook, let me -- I don't want you to feel that you've been \nneglected here and that Professor Sutton has been hogging all the time.\n\nCOOK: I said oh yes, I was feeling that.\n\nDURBIN: Yes, I know you were (inaudible).  But I understand you're the most frequent dissenter on the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio.  You have well over 300 dissents in your eight years on the court.\n\nI'm told you once joked that the female justices on your court have three names, Alice Robie Resnick, Evelyn \nLundberg Stratton, and Deborah Cook dissenting.  Should I have a concern about your judicial temperament, an \ninability to reach consensus if you have that many dissents?\n\nAnd I ask the question not in a frivolous fashion because the Sixth Circuit is a fairly polarized court and if anything \nwe'd like to see the Sixth Circuit help the people within its circuit to reach more consensus opinions and not \npolarized. Should I be worrying about your judicial temperament?\n\n\n\nCOOK: I should think not, Senator.  Dissenting is really, as I said before in answer to some other question, it really \nis a learning process.  Many times I am somehow designated to write the dissent for other members of the court \nand, therefore, my numbers look rather high.\n\nBut dissents are offered as -- for the benefit of other side who offer the first opinion.  It's a method to reach \nconsensus sometimes and in our court it's actually a matter of logistics.  The members of the court lives in various \nparts of the state so consensus is the first objective, and unfortunately it's not always reached, but certainly that's \nthe first goal. But I don't really think you can take anything from the fact that I write dissents, other than I am \nattempting to do a precise reading of the law.\n\nDURBIN: You may think the Democratic Senator would take comfort in the fact that often when you've dissented \nthe Republican majority in your own court though has been quite critical of your view of law. In Bunger v. Lawson, \nthe majority called your interpretation of the law nonsensical.  They said it leaves an untenable position.  It's unfair \nto employees.  They said your opinion would be \"an absurd interpretation that seems borrowed from the pages of \n'Catch 22.'\"\n\nIn, Russell v. Industrial Commission of Ohio, they stated your dissent lacked statutory support for its position, that \nyou were unable to cite even the slightest dictum from any case to support your view and your argument, which has \nnot been raised by the commission, the bureau, the claimant's employer, any of this (inaudible) is entirely without \nmerit.\n\nIn Ohio Academy v. Sheward (ph) the majority held that tort reform law is unconstitutional because it severely \nlimited an injured party's ability to recover from wrongdoers no matter the type of injury.\n\nAnd then, they responded to a dissent to join stating that \"the dissenting judges mischaracterized our findings, \nmisconstrued prior decisions of this court, selectively extrapolated portions of the legislation at issue while ignoring \nits overall tenor and content, disassociate themselves from a decision in which one of them concurred, suggested \nwe create a new theory of standing, minimizing the magnitude and scope of the legislation, and the importance of \nseparation of powers, accused us of language unbecoming a judicial opinion, questioned our faith in our courts of \nrecord, all in an obvious effort to distort our opinion into a form susceptible to (inaudible) criticism and protect this \nlegislation (inaudible), meaningful and inclusive judicial review.\"\n\nI don't know about Ohio, but in Vermont that would go beyond understated New England criticism. It's pretty strong \ncriticism and I read this because I worry one, as I said will polarize Sixth Circuit, whether you would be not one to \nhelp bring people together but one to further polarize it, that you overwhelmingly favor employers in complaints \nbrought by workers.  In fact, I haven't found a case where you dissented in favor of an injured employee in a claim \nbrought against his or her employer.\n\nSo, I raise this, Justice Cook.  These are all things you've heard.\n\nLEAHY: I mean, you read the opinions.  Please help us here. Why such strong words by the majority, mainly \nRepublicans, for your dissents?\n\nCOOK: The court is nominally 5-2 Republican but as you'll note from some of the newspaper stories there are a \nnumber of Republicans on the court who are labeled as everyone is labeled.  They are labeled as liberal and I'm so-\ncalled conservative.  But the -- so, I'm not sure we can draw too much from the conservative (inaudible).\n\nLEAHY: Is this a liberal vendetta against you?\n\nCOOK: No, not at all.  I think it was -- you know I'm sorry for the tone. It does appear to be a tone of a little beyond \nwhat we expect but it was a reasonable difference in Sheward (ph).  That's the case where you find that language.  \nI'm not -- I think it might be stirred somewhat by the fact that this case was very unusual.  In fact it was exceedingly \nunprecedented and really an untenable procedural posture by which the case came to us.\n\nIt wasn't an individual bringing a case to right a wrong or to achieve a remedy. In fact it was an organization, the \nOhio Academy of Trial Lawyers, so that's where the standing issue came in.  That's not typically what we see.  And \n\n\n\nbeyond that, the case was brought as an effort to get a writ, to ask the court to issue a writ to tell the judges in the \nstate to not enforce this newly enacted legislation on tort reform.\n\nAnd my dissent, frankly, was only on the issues of standing and the procedural posture that simply wasn't tenable, \nand nevertheless the court did issue a writ even though the standard for issuing a writ couldn't possibly have been \nmet in this case.  But so, I'm\u2026\n\nLEAHY: But they were pretty\u2026\n\nCOOK: I can't really defend the language in the majority.\n\nLEAHY: But they were pretty strong in more than one case.  I mean they were pretty strong in their criticism of your \ndissent and when you've had well over 300 dissents in eight years, you know, I assume you could pick and choose \nwhere they were critical, but in the areas that I've read, the criticism seems to go way beyond the collegiality one \nnormally sees in a court, and the numbers of your dissent, of course, go way beyond anybody else in the court.\n\nIt is one thing to joke that your name is Deborah Cook dissenting but again in a polarized Sixth Circuit it creates a \nproblem to me. I'm concerned that as an appellate judge you've repeatedly voted to overturn a jury's determination \nthat the employees before them were victims of discrimination.\n\nNow, I've tried an awful lot of jury cases.  I know all the effort that goes into getting a jury verdict and I know the \ncourts are very reluctant to overturn a jury verdict.  They've only got a cold record.  They haven't seen the \nwitnesses. They haven't heard them.\n\nBut I think your dissent in Leonard v. St. Govain (ph) that's troubling.  Four women sued their employer for gender \ndiscrimination. They received a jury verdict.  It was overturned by the appellate court and in a majority the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio ruled that the appellate court erred in overturning the jury verdict, none of the proper legal standards, \nthey could not uphold the appellate court's ruling unless reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion, the \nemployer was not liable.\n\nCOOK: I think that's the case\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Right.\n\nCOOK: If I may, Senator.\n\nLEAHY: Sure.\n\nCOOK: I believe that's the case where the Court of Appeals initially ruled that the verdict should be overturned in \ninsufficiency and, in fact, wrote a 97-page very detailed opinion, and when the case reached our court it actually \nwas a very short decision that said there was some evidence, and it seemed to me, and I voiced this in my dissent \nthat the tort had really not applied any analytical rigor, nor applied the standard set forth in Civil Rule 50 for directed \nverdict and that was the basis for that dissent.\n\nAnd, I don't -- I think collegiality is very important on the court.  I have had a very good reputation for improving the \ncollegiality of the Court of Appeals where I formerly served.\n\nLEAHY: But collegiality aside, Justice Cook, it seems that time and time again if somebody has sued an employer \nand they've gotten a jury verdict, you seem very comfortable in overturning that jury verdict.  Now, I've seen \nrunaway juries where the appellate court should overturn it, but it's rare.  It's extraordinarily rare.  You seem to find \nthem a lot but I think in most states that's pretty rare that a jury that was a finder of fact gets overturned.\n\nCOOK: Yes, I don't know if we went through all the cases.  I don't know that we'd find that it's done a lot.  I know a \ncase that's been cited is the Burns (ph) case but that was a majority opinion that overturned that verdict in an \nemployment case.\n\n\n\nLEAHY: The Reeves (ph) case, the Burns case, the St. Govain case.\n\nCOOK: I can tell you, Senator, I've been on the receiving end of that and I know it's no fun.  I actually made some \nlaw in Ohio on discrimination representing a woman in an age discrimination case, Jean Barker (ph), and it's the \nJean Barker case that is cited as authority in the Burns decision.  As I say, I didn't write that decision but Jean \nBarker -- we had a verdict at the trial level and it was overturned by the Supreme Court.  So, it's precedent that \npops up in some of these cases.\n\nSo, I certainly don't take it lightly and verdicts are not to be overturned unless there is, in some of these cases, \ninsufficiency of the evidence.  We all know the standards where a verdict can be overturned and it's not done \nwithout the right facts or the absence of facts that warrant reversing a decision.\n\nBut in a lot of these cases, I think you'll find that if I were the dissenter, I wasn't writing just for myself and moreover \nquite often you'll find that it's the Court of Appeals, a unanimous Court of Appeals that felt likewise.  So, I'm not sure \nI can easily be said to have missed the boat inasmuch as sometimes at least three other judges and perhaps as \nmany as five agreed, six agreed.\n\nLEAHY: Justice Cook, my time is up but we'll come back to this. I did not want you feeling neglected.\n\nCOOK: I appreciate that.\n\nLEAHY: And feel that Professor Sutton was hogging all the questions.\n\nHATCH: How considerate of you, Senator.\n\nLEAHY: I try.\n\nHATCH: Senator DeWine for just a few minutes, Senator.\n\nDEWINE: Thank you.  Justice Cook, Senator Leahy has indicated that you seem to always rule in favor of the \nemployer.  I've got at least 23 cases here where you've ruled in favor of the employee in employment cases, Ahern \nv. Tactical Construction, Browder v. Narvis Construction (ph), Voy v. Chippewa Local School District (ph), Connolly \nv. Brown (ph), Douglas v. Administration.  I'll go on and on. I would submit these for the record, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Without objection we'll put those in the record.\n\nDEWINE: Justice Cook, I want to discuss with you for a moment Senator Leahy's comments about you being \nlabeled a dissenter, and you certainly have dissented in a number of cases.\n\nLet's first start with the cases that -- five cases that were appealed from the Ohio Supreme Court to the United \nStates Supreme Court.  One of the cases was simply a unanimous Ohio Supreme Court decision which was, in \nfact, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.  But in the other four cases, you disagreed with the majority of your \ncolleagues.\n\nCOOK: That's correct.\n\nDEWINE: You dissented.  You dissented.  Your colleagues were on the other side.  In each one of those cases, the \nUnited States Supreme Court said you, Justice Cook, were right and your colleagues were wrong, is that correct?\n\nCOOK: Yes, it is.\n\nDEWINE: So, being a dissenter in that case may not have been right but at least it's what the United States \nSupreme Court thought was right.\n\nCOOK: That's right.  That was good enough for me.\n\n\n\nDEWINE: So, being a dissenter is not always the worst thing in the world. In the State of Ohio, Mr. Chairman and \nmembers of the committee, we do have right or wrong, right or wrong we do have what at least the Ohio \nnewspapers, and as I said earlier this morning, it seems like it's been a long, long time ago.  I guess it was a long \ntime ago.\n\nWhat the Ohio newspapers have labeled to be a very activist Ohio Supreme Court, and whether you think that's a \ngood idea or not a good idea that's not what we're debating today.  But the Ohio newspapers, which run the gamut \nin the political spectrum, and I can say this as someone whose run for political office in Ohio for a long, long, time, \nwe have everything from the liberal to the conservative in the state of Ohio as far as the newspapers.\n\nBut each newspaper, major newspaper in the state of Ohio has labeled the Ohio Supreme Court as being a very, \nvery activist Supreme Court.  I will not take the time of the committee at this point to read the different editorials that \nmake this point, but I am going to hand out to the different members of the committee, and also ask the chairman to \nmake a part of the record\u2026\n\nHATCH: Without objection.\n\nDEWINE: ...this document which basically talks -- these are different quotes from the different editorials which talks \nabout how active the Supreme Court is, and I would tell the members of the committee that it is on a bipartisan \nbasis that it is active.  This activist, very sweeping activist opinions, and I'm just going to read a couple of the -- it \nwill take just a moment to read a couple of the comments from the court -- excuse me, from the newspapers.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court, this is from the \"Toledo Blade.\" The Ohio Supreme Court simply is not well regarded \naround the country and it's the meddling tendencies of this four-judge super legislature that deserves most of the \nblame.  The people of Ohio elected legislators are governed to make laws and govern but their intent has been \nthwarted by this activist court.\n\nHATCH (?): Excuse me, Senator I didn't hear what he's quoting from.\n\nDEWINE: This is the \"Toledo Blade\" editorial.\n\nHATCH: OK, thank you.\n\nDEWINE: The point is that I think you will find, again, whatever way you come down on these issues that the \ndisputes on the court and the disagreement that Senator Leahy was quoting from in these cases pretty much \ncomes down to where Justice Cook was dissenting based on her strict interpretation of the law versus the court's \nmore activist interpretation of the law, and I will reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.  I'll reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n\nHATCH: Thank you.  Senator Biden has not had his first round, so if it's all right with everybody (inaudible).\n\nU.S. SENATOR JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. (D-DE): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I apologize to the committee and the \nwitnesses.  This has been a pretty busy day and I've been spending my whole day dealing with issues relating to \nIraq, and I have a lot of questions.  I hope we're going to have a chance to have this panel over because I, for one, \nhave not a lot.  I have about a half hour's, an hour's worth of questions that I am because of the schedule today not \nable to do and (inaudible).\n\nHATCH: We're happy to give you the time now, Senator Biden (inaudible).\n\nBIDEN: Let me -- I won't take that time now because in large part I can't.  I have another commitment relating to the \nForeign Relations Committee I have to do at 6:18.  But let me start off by just asking one or two questions in the few \nminutes here.\n\nProfessor Sutton, I'm a little concerned with the nature and the way in which the Supreme Court necessarily has cut \nback significantly the number of cases it reviews.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: There are about 80 cases a year and that most of the significant cases, whether we're talking about the \ndecisions relating to Roe v. Wade or any other case, there is enough ambiguity and significantly less review that the \nCircuit Court of Appeals has, in every circuit, has a significant impact beyond what they had 20 years ago in making \nlaw.\n\nAnd so, I have a number of questions for you, Professor, relating to your notion of the role of the court and your \nassertion, I'm told and correct me if I'm wrong, that you've indicated, and I quote that \"federalism is a zero sum \nsituation in which either the state or the federal lawmaking prerogative must fall.\"\n\nThat is a constitutional view that I have an overwhelming disagreement with, and I suffer from the fact that I spend a \nlot of time teaching the Separation of Power Doctrine and I think it's not inconsistent with where the majority of the \nSupreme Court has gone, but I think it's -- I think it's fundamentally flawed constitutional methodology.\n\nAnd, that's not to say that it is not intellectually defensible. It's to say that I have fundamental disagreement with it \nand, I want to be straight up with you.\n\nI know this is not for the Supreme Court but based on what I've read, assuming it's consistent with what you would \nrespond to, if you were a nominee for the Supreme Court, I would not, even though you're intellectually and morally \nand in every way capable of sitting on the court, I would do all of my power to keep you off the court because it \nappears as though we have such a fundamentally divergent view of the Tenth Amendment, the Eleventh \nAmendment, and the role of federalism that I just want to be up front with you about that.\n\nAnd so, for me, I will not get an opportunity to go into any great detail tonight obviously but I have some questions I \nwould like you to respond to. And, let me begin by suggesting that, and I do not ask this out of parochial interest \nalthough I have great pride in being the person who drafted the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nBut, I'd like to understand your reasoning beyond the fact that you were an advocate here if there is a reason \nbeyond your advocacy representing a client.  And you filed a brief in the Supreme Court on behalf of the State of \nAlabama arguing against the constitutionality of the federal civil remedy of victim sexual assault and violence.\n\nNow, this is not a question of whether or not you were confirmed or not confirmed by the court, whether your view \nprevailed or not. It's a question of my trying to figure out how you approach these issues.\n\nAmong other things, your brief in Morrison stated that gender- based violence does not substantially affect \ninterstate commerce. Now, prior to the Violence Against Women Act, I literally held nine hearings and received \ntestimony for over 100 witnesses, at the end of which those long and thorough explorations, the Congress \nconcluded, not just me, that gender-based violent crimes in fear of these -- I must leave in one minute, wonderful.\n\nI'm going to have to submit this question to you in writing, but the bottom line is what I'm trying to get a sense of is \nhow you approach what you consider to be the prerogatives of the Congress, Section 5 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, the significant change in the way in which this court, which I think is a bright court but is the most \nactivist court in the history of the United States of America.\n\nNo court has overruled as many national pieces of legislation, including the New Deal Era as this court has, and I \nwant you to know to be blunt with you, I come from sort of the Souter of it in the sense in the Florida prepaid cases \nand their progeny where Souter said, \"The fact of such a substantial effect is not the issue of the courts in the first \ninstance, but for the Congress' institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours.\n\nGoing on, Souter says, \"I'm left wondering where does the Court's decision leave Congress' former plenary power \nto remove serious obstructions to interstate commerce by whatever source?  It is reminiscent of the Lockner Era \nwhen they said, by the way, you have those labor standards having to do with mining.  Mining is not interstate \ncommerce.\n\nThen they came along and said production is not interstate commerce.  Then they said manufacturing is not \ninterstate commerce, until midway in the New Deal with the end of the Lockner Era they said whoa, whoa, whoa, \nwait a minute, wait a minute.\"\n\n\n\nWhat I'm really trying to get at, and I'll submit these questions in writing, is at what point does the court decide to \nbecome the federal traffic cop?  At what point does the court's authority to intervene in what I believe \nconstitutionally has been left to the Congress under the Constitution to make judgments about?  And, you seem to \nhave an incredibly restrictive view of the Congress' prerogatives.\n\nThis is not Lopez, where the court did not have sufficient findings, where the court did not find sufficient findings.  \nEven this court said there is no question that there was an extensive record, but we as they did in Alton (ph) \nRailroad in years earlier said, but we don't think that's sufficient, and I wondered who the hell the court is to make \nthat judgment that we don't think the remedy you chose is effective.\n\nThat's a very rapid attempt to summarize my concerns, so you have a context in which to understand the questions, \nwhy I'm asking the questions straightforwardly?\n\nSUTTON: No.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate your being straightforward.  There's no doubt the criticism you just \nlevied against the Morrison decision is the strongest criticism and is clearly the most difficult part of the case for the \ncourt in exactly where the 5/4 line was, and that line was how much deference to give to these findings.\n\nAnd, you know, you were kind enough to mention I was involved in that case on behalf of a client.  I was working as \nan advocate and I was doing my best by them, and I, you know, what I would have done in that case God only \nknows.  The one thing I would say though about your concern about the Court of Appeals judges, I agree with you. I \nwish the U.S. Supreme Court would take more cases.  It made my U.S. Supreme Court practice very difficult to \nsustain.  They take so few cases.\n\nBut, I'm not aware of too many, in fact none, Court of Appeals decisions that struck a federal law, in other words \nyour handiwork, that weren't eventually, and usually quite promptly reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBIDEN: I think that's true.  Most have been, but there are cases, and I'm compiling this.  I think we'll be able to show \nthere are roughly, there are over 200 cases in the Circuit Court of Appeals has found enough leeway in the existing \nlaw where they have changed basic law without any review by the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court \nnever took the cases.\n\nAnd, I've had my staff in the process of preparing for some time now, which is quite frankly unrelated to you or any \none of you, is beginning to make me review my standard for review of nominees.  I have a very different standard \nfor 30 years of reviewing Supreme Court nominees because they're not bound by stare decisis, than I do reviewing \ndistrict and circuit court judges.\n\nBut I'm moving to the view that there should be in effect, to steal a phrase from the court, an intermediate standard \nfor Circuit Court of Appeal judges because they have become so much more significant in being the final arbiters.  \nThey are not legally, the Supreme Court is, but because of the review process, they have become the final arbiters \nin areas where I used to be able to say I know the court will review this.\n\nIf you are bound by stare decisis, you will, and I trust your judicial temperament that you mean that, then in fact I'll \ntake a chance on you even though I fundamentally disagree with your constitutional methodology because you'll \nabide by the decisions.  But there are enough discrepancies or differences or holes in the reasoning.\n\nI mean look at all the cases that have flown, and this is not my major concern but look at all the cases that have \nbeen the progeny of Roe v. Wade.  They're very, very, very complicated, whether it's (inaudible) or whether it's the \nissue of parental notification, all these issues.\n\nAnd, in the past, I never doubted that the court would review those. But now what's happening is the court's in a \nposition where it does not review a significant portion of the Circuit Court of Appeals decisions that change state \nlaw or uphold state law that are never reviewed and that's the only generic point I wish to make with you.\n\nAnd, one of the questions is going to be you as an advocate, I assume it's your answer but I'd appreciate an honest \nanswer if it's not, you argued in your brief that even the Congress did not show that sexual violence, violence \n\n\n\nagainst women had no impact in their state Congress.  Whether or not we get into the question of what constitutes \ncommerce, that it had no impact by the old standard of what constituted commerce as I read your brief.\n\nSUTTON: Well, maybe I'm not understanding the question but the point I think we were trying to make was in all of \nthe commerce clause cases, high watermark cases, Worker v. Filburn (ph), Jones & Laughlin, Lopez even, there's \nbeen a consensus that the court does have a role in determining whether something does\u2026\n\nBIDEN: Is interstate commerce.\n\nSUTTON: \u2026 impact interstate commerce and I thought that was meant to be the main theme of the brief that the \ncourt did have a role here whether it decides to uphold (inaudible) or not.\n\nBIDEN: But did not you argue that it does have a role in making a judgment whether it impacts.  But in order for you \nto reach the conclusion that it did not impact interstate commerce, you had to fundamentally disregard the 100 \nhours of hearings that the Congress held and concluded that it did, correct?\n\nSUTTON: I can certainly understand someone taking that view but I would say it is directed\u2026\n\nBIDEN: Is there any other view to take?\n\nSUTTON: ...at my client.  The client is the one that took that position and I did everything I could to advocate that \nposition, and I do\u2026\n\nBIDEN: Do you believe that?  Do you believe that?  I'm not suggesting it was inappropriate for you to -- for example, \nif you were teaching it, would you teach that the Congress, the facts presented in the case in the congressional \nrecord did not warrant, did not warrant the court's concurrence because as my good friend Justice Scalia says \neverybody knows they never read this stuff and they never write this stuff those Senators.  It's done by staff.  So, \ndismissively it's taken out of the record.  I mean is that a view you share?\n\nSUTTON: No, it is not a view I share.  I guess the point I would make is that there was a voluminous record, no \ndoubt about it in the battle and of course there was just one provision of that law at issue.\n\nBIDEN: I know that.\n\nSUTTON: (inaudible) implicated, much less attacked, and I think the issue in the case is such a difficult one is \nwhether there are sufficient amount of findings that no matter how much they are, no matter how much better \nequipped this body is to make these findings than the court is, whether there's still a role and the responsibility of \nthe court to examine them to determine whether they do constitute under the Constitution interstate commerce.\n\nWhat would I have done?  I have no idea as a Court of Appeals judge.  I just, I'm sorry I can't tell you that.  I'm not \nlooking at the issues that way.\n\nBIDEN: No, I'm not asking you what you would have done but I do want to explore these issues with you and I have \nquestions as well for the other nominees.  Like I said, I hope we have more time.\n\nI understand my name was invoked when someone raised the issue of whether or not we had three not unqualified \nbut controversial nominees all in one hear, and Biden did it.  The three that Biden put together had a vote of I think \n98-0, so they were not controversial.  I thank you all.  I apologize for having to leave.\n\nHATCH: We have to stand corrected.\n\nBIDEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: OK, Senator Kennedy.\n\nU.S. SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY (D-MA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our witnesses.  It's been a \nlong day for all of you and we appreciate your patience as well.  I regret that I was unable to be here earlier today.\n\n\n\nThis afternoon I attended a memorial for a former Congressman Wayne Owens, who was a Congressman from the \nState of Utah, and I had thought that perhaps we could have had a brief recess where several of us who know \nWayne Owens and had a lot of respect for him.  He actually worked for me, worked for my brother.  Bob had a \nchance to go there.\n\nSo, unlike most of the other hearings where members are able to stay and go through it, we come in here not sure \nwhether some of these areas have been covered in the past or not.  But nonetheless, I will move ahead and we'll \ndo the best we can.  I must say I just again want to register with the chairman at the opening of the session if this is \nthe way the committee is going to be conducted.\n\nI'm not sure that this accelerates the good will of the committee or the action of the committee in the long term or \neven in the short term, but that's an issue for another time.\n\nKENNEDY: Justice Cook, I want to come back to this issue in terms of your dissents, and who you've been finding \nfor.  I picked up a little bit of the comments that my friend Senator DeWine raised in response to some of Leahy's \nquestions but I'd like to come back to this issue with you if I could please, and that is there is at least -- there is at \nleast an argument that is made that your decisions come down in protecting the more powerful against the weak, \nthat you've worked hard to make it more difficult, for example, for those that are injured in the workplace to get \nrightful compensation.\n\nYou've made it more difficult for victims of discrimination to get justice.  You've made it easier for large corporations \nto avoid paying for the harms that their defective products have caused.\n\nI know these are not new to you but I want to hear from you.  In fact, some have said that your views have \nmarginalized you, even on a conservative court, that you authored at least 313 dissents, many of them loan \ndissents.  This number is extraordinary, is in fact more than any other justice on your court.  What's more, even with \nall of these dissents, you have never dissented from any decision of the court that was favorable to the employer.\n\nYou stand up for the big business all the time.  You've never stood up for the rights of the individual.  To the \ncontrary, you've descended 23 times in cases in which the court ruled in favor of the employee.  That's 79 percent \nof the time.  You've only voted for an employee six times, and in five of those cases, the court was unanimous.  In \nthe other case the court voted 6-1 in favor of the employee.\n\nAll of this is why your rating by the Ohio Chamber of Commerce is not surprising.  They say you rank first in voting \nfor the employer in employment cases.  You also rank first in voting with the defendant in product liability cases.  \nYou even scored a perfect 100 percent in insurance cases on issues affecting the environment voting with the \ncorporate defendant 100 percent of the time.\n\nNow, all of us are aware about these percentages and I want to give you an opportunity to respond to those and to \nthe other observations that I made about your holdings.  It seems that you're in dissent so often because you are \nconsistently and knowingly pro- business, anti-workers, anti-civil rights.\n\nAnd I want to hear from you what conclusions you think we ought to draw from those percentages and from that \nrecord about how balanced that you could be and how either workers or those people again who are left behind \nthose that care about the environment, other issues that are in conflict between employer and employee, how they \ncould look to you in your court and feel they're going to get a fair shake.\n\nCOOK: Thanks, Senator.  I'll address that.  First of all, I think to say, as you acknowledge, these percentages are \nnothing I can ever check or know how they arrive at those so I sure don't vouch for those sort of things.  But if you \nwill, you know, I tried to just gather cases.\n\nI think Senator DeWine put out a listing of the cases that show that frankly I'm not a reliable vote for anyone, that \nmy decision- making, and I hope you'll find this if you actually read the cases and read the dissents, you'll find I \nhope that it's a matter more of my precise reading of the law, looking for the actual text of the statute, and when the \n\n\n\ncases, the results of the cases go against an employee or, you know, in the general civil rights kind of ideas, I \nfrankly don't -- I don't think I deserve any blame for the legislation that I am asked to construe or interpret.\n\nAnd so, as in many of the cases there's a Doe case which involved allowing insurance for negligent hiring in \nmolestation cases. In Hanes v. City of Franklin (ph) there was an edge drop off a road and though the majority of \nthe case thought that the city was immune and not liable for damages in that case, I dissented and said indeed the \ncity was because the city created a nuisance.\n\nIn Richey Produce (ph) I upheld a minority business set aside. In Makoff v. Fairview General Hospital (ph) it was a \ntragic case of medical malpractice where an individual came in with a fracture of the leg.  In the setting of that leg, \nthe circulation was cut off which ultimately resulted in amputation.  I upheld the verdict of $2.4 million.\n\nIn Buckeye Hope case, I dissented from the court's decision that a referendum could deny minority housing in a city \nin Ohio. Ultimately, the court reconsidered that case and my dissent then became part of the majority.  In Vallish v. \nCopley Board of Education (ph), I upheld a verdict for a teacher or a parent who came on school property.  Again, \nthe majority found that that individual, that the school was immune under our sovereign immunity law and I ruled \nthe other way.\n\nIn Rice v. (inaudible), there's a case about whether or not punitive damages can be awarded in discrimination \ncases, and in that case I interpreted the language of the statute.  The word \"damages\" I found was not limited by \ncontext or any modifiers and therefore allowed, ruled that that word included the whole panoply of pecuniary \nremedies.  In Wallace v. Ohio Department, Gibson v. Meadow Gold (ph), I have -- I don't want to bore the \ncommittee but I have more Senator.\n\nKENNEDY: Well, I, the reason I raise this.  You mentioned some and I'll review those cases.  I was thinking of \nsome of those the, I guess the Sponger v. Lawson (ph), and in that case called -- the court -- as I understand it, \ncalled Cook's interpretation of the law nonsensical, said that it leads to an untenable position, unfair to employees, \nadopting the lower court's interpretation.\n\nOr taking the position adopted by Justice Cook in her dissent would be as the majority clearly stated an absurd \ninterpretation that seems to borrow from the pages of \"Catch 22.\"\n\nCOOK: And actually, Senator, in that case, it was interpreting the statute in the usual mode but what the majority \nreally was concerned about was that the law in Ohio is pretty plainly expressed that someone who is injured in the \ncourse of employment, they can -- the compensability can be narrower than the immunity.  Employers are immune \nfrom suit and therefore there are occasions where someone can be injured but their injuries not compensable and \nthat's exactly how the law is written and that's my job to read it precisely.\n\nKENNEDY: In the Russell v. Industrial Commission, the court stated that your dissent lacks statutory support for its \nposition and has been unable to cite even the slightest dictum from any case to support its review.\n\nCOOK: Like so many dissents (inaudible).\n\nKENNEDY: I didn't have an opportunity to give these cases to you before, so I\u2026\n\nCOOK: I know that, sir.\n\nKENNEDY: I'll be glad to let you give whatever response or the time to do it because it's\u2026\n\nCOOK: In that case there was, number one a statutory, a new enactment, so a statutory change in the language.  \nMy dissent was joined by the chief justice, and so I think it's well reasoned.  I think it's based on the statutory text \n(inaudible).\n\nKENNEDY: Well now in the Russell case, as I understand it, you argued that the workman's compensation benefits \nshould terminate without a hearing as soon as the non-attending physician says the benefit should stop.  You \nargued that in spite of the statutory language, that could not be, that couldn't be more clear.\n\n\n\nIt says that benefits, this is what the statutory language says. \"Payments shall be for a duration based upon the \nmedical reports of the attending physician.  If the employer disputes the attending physician's report, payments may \nbe terminated only upon application and hearing by a district hearing officer.\"\n\nCOOK: That's right.\n\nKENNEDY: And you interpret that statute entirely differently. You argue that the compensation base should be \nterminated without a hearing as soon as the non-attending physician said the benefits should stop.\n\nCOOK: Actually\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: Now if as I understand it the employer disputes the attending physician's payment may be terminated \nonly, as I said, upon the hearing officer.  The majority stated your dissent lacked statutory support, unable to cite \neven the dictum for the case.\n\nCOOK: Right and we really disagreed in that case as people in good faith can always disagree about the meaning \nof words.  But, in that case, the majority and the dissent disagreed about which statute to read.  So, I was \nconstruing, my dissent construed an analogous statute and a parallel statute that had to be read in conjunction with \nthe one that the majority was relying upon.\n\nKENNEDY: I'm not an expert on the Ohio law, but it seems that in the citation it's fairly clear that payment shall be \nfor a duration based on the medical reports of the attending physician.\n\nCOOK: That's right.\n\nKENNEDY: If the employer disputes the physician, payments may be terminated only upon application and hearing \nby a district hearing officer.\n\nCOOK: (inaudible).\n\nKENNEDY: And you made the judgment that it could be terminated without a hearing.\n\nCOOK: Yes.  The issue\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: And you have another statute.\n\nCOOK: Yes.  The issue really surrounded\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: Could you reference that?  I won't -- the other statute?\n\nCOOK: Yes, I will.\n\nKENNEDY: This is the concern about in light of the persistent dissents and your consistent siding with the large \ncorporations against the individuals and departures from the clear language of the law, how are we going to be \nassured that you won't overreach in order to reach a conservative result?\n\nNow, let me give you another example.  As you know, one of the real best weapons that we have in the struggle to \nimprove the lives of those who are left behind in our society is education, and when we educate our children well, \nwe give them an opportunity to take part of the American dream.\n\nYou, however, have taken the Ohio Constitution's provisions guaranteeing the thorough and efficient public \neducation and voted to basically interpret it out of existence.  This is the (inaudible) v. Ohio case.  You were \nconfronted with overwhelming evidence that state funding of public schools was woefully inadequate.  In fact, much \nof the evidence in that case showed that children were attending schools that were in dangerous repair with poor \nsanitation and few, if any, resources for education.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the court followed Ohio Supreme Court precedent and said where a school district is starved for \nfunds or lacks teachers, buildings, or equipment, the right to an education is violated.  It found that the woefully \nunder funding of such important state funds should say education violated the Ohio Constitution.  You dissented.\n\nYou would have denied the right of the children of Ohio the right to a thorough and efficient state education.  In \nfact, your dissent was harshly criticized, particularly said that if your position prevailed it would have turned 200 \nyears of the constitutional jurisprudence on its head.\n\nI understand in your personal life you acknowledge that education is important but we're talking about this particular \ncase.  How do you explain your decision on this issue that is so important and is an issue that is common to my \nstate and states across the country and in which there is such a challenge in order to try to provide some quality of \nfunding for children?  And Ohio has such a very strong statute.  I find it very difficult to understand your dissent.\n\nCOOK: My dissent was first of all grounded on no member of the court and there were three members of the -- or \ntwo other members of the court who joined me in dissent about the constitutional bases that the majority was using \nto order a co-equal branch of government to enact new funding statutes.\n\nSo, actually I never did in any way vote to reduce educational spending or in any way voted to say that the sorry \nstate of some schools in Ohio was OK.  Instead, I had a limited role as was assigned.\n\nThe court has an assigned limited role and I exercised my role appropriately, I think, in saying that the phrase that \nthe court was hanging its hat on did not justify its ordering a co-equal branch to enact new funding laws because \nthe Department of Education had certified that every county in the state had met the minimum standards for \nproviding an education.\n\nCOOK: So my view was beyond the minimums, it was the General Assembly's role to decide what level of funding \nshould be allocated to schools versus every other required funding -- every other aspect of state government that \nrequired funding was a policy decision to be made by the legislative branch.\n\nBut I must say that that case has a fairly sorry history.  It lasted some six years and the court never, though it had \nsome I think very well intentioned -- it was a well intentioned effort but it actually -- the court never was able to \ncontinue to order the General Assembly to do more and do more and frankly it's finally just the case faded away.\n\nKENNEDY: Well, that's the sad conclusion that's happened in some states.  States have different, in their \nconstitutions, different errs.  Massachusetts, John Adams drafted our constitution in Massachusetts and made it \nvery specific with regards actually to -- on the responsibility of the state in education.  It is interesting that every \nstate constitution has a guarantee on education.  They're interpreted in different ways.\n\nBut let me come back to the Ohio, the Ohio Constitution requires a thorough and efficient education.  These words \nhave meaning.  They can be interpreted and forced by a court willing to take its responsibilities seriously.  In fact, a \nnumber of the states have found that similar causes in their constitutions enforceable.\n\nYour unwillingness to interpret and enforce this clause of the constitution I find disturbing.  I understand you believe \nthe clause is too vague for traditional enforcement.  In your dissent you analyzed -- compared it to another provision \nof the Ohio Constitution that says that all citizens possess inalienable rights to life, liberty, property happiness and \nsafety.\n\nBut even that clause has much the same language of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution \nclauses, which have been analyzed and enforced for many years.  And, I'm just wondering how much assurance \nthat we can have here that you're going to interpret these statutes in ways that were intended and that reasonable \npeople would feel that they should be intended?\n\nCOOK: That would be my goal, Senator.  That would be my effort.\n\nKENNEDY: If I could, Mr. Chairman, I have one additional period.\n\n\n\nHATCH: That will be fine, Senator Kennedy.  We'll give you the additional time.\n\nKENNEDY: Thank you.  Much of the last two years have been spent recovering from corporate malfeasance that \nhas hurt our economy, our national, I'm talking about our country.  It undermined the public's trust in big business.  \nThe laws play an important role in restoring the confidence of the American people of preventing this abuse in the \nfuture.\n\nUnfortunately, in looking over your record, and I want to give you a chance to respond, one could conclude that you \nhave consistently voted to shield corporation from the legal consequences of their actions.\n\nIn the Davis v. Wal-Mart, Mrs. Davis alleged that Wal-Mart instructed its employees to lie to her after her husband \nwas killed while working for Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart allegedly told its employees to lie about the way in which Mr. Davis \nhad been killed in order to encourage Mrs. Davis to settle out of court.  The majority understandably found this sort \nof deception reprehensible and allowed Mrs. Davis to sue Wal-Mart.\n\nYou would have prevented her from doing that, thereby allowing Wal-Mart to reap from the benefit of the lies and \nencouraging other corporations to do the same thing.\n\nCOOK: My decision in that case does not suggest that I too don't find that behavior reprehensible.  My dissent \nactually was based on a fundamental principle of jurisprudence and that is res judicata, and it was based on really \nwell settled law that the fact that Mrs. Davis sued Wal-Mart, got a judgment for negligence and then years later \ncame back with a spoliation case I found -- my view was that it was res judicata and in favor of finality of judgments.  \nAs we all know that's why that principle is there and why it's accorded importance by judges.\n\nKENNEDY: But the majority didn't find that.\n\nCOOK: No, they did not.\n\nKENNEDY: They reached a different conclusion.\n\nCOOK: Yes, that's right.\n\nKENNEDY: In Norgard v. Brush Wellman (ph), the defendant corporation withheld information concerning how \nmuch it was exposing its employees to beryllium, including withholding the fact that it knew its air sampling were \nflawed and that it had ventilation problems.\n\nAnd, it gave the plaintiffs in this case a skin disorder so severe he had ulcers.  He suffered from protracted periods \nof dizziness, coughing, had difficulty breathing.  The company just told him not to worry and continued to withhold \nthe information about the problems with beryllium.\n\nThe majority found that the employee's time to file a suit started running from the time he found out about the \ninformation his employer had been withholding, but you would have allowed the corporation again to reap the \nbenefits by barring this suit.\n\nCOOK: And actually\u2026\n\nKENNEDY: You know how can -- what can we draw from that?\n\nCOOK: I hope that the only thing that you'll draw from that is that I look at the law on statute of limitations and the \nparticular -- my decision was simply a statute of limitations decision.  What -- as a lawyer.\n\nKENNEDY: That's the\u2026\n\nCOOK: May I finish?  As a lawyer, Senator, and so many people on the committee are, this individual had \nknowledge of his injury and the expected cause but didn't file suit until some five years later when the statute of \nlimitations in Ohio is two years.\n\n\n\nSo, what I just viewed and perhaps I was the one who was mistaken, but I viewed the majority decision as \ncontorting the law of statute of limitations beyond the scope of its justification there.\n\nKENNEDY: Well, you're right the majority differed with you.  I mean the corporation withheld information \nconcerning how much it was exposing the employees and that it -- and so, since the defendant didn't know about \nthis effectively by the time they found out and brought the case you ruled that they really didn't have -- the statute \nhad run on it and they were denied any opportunity.\n\nThis is enormously important.  We have a lot of workers, miners. We have a lot of occupational health and safety \nissues involving lung damage, and increasingly so with regards to the dangers of toxic substances that are being \nused in industry all of the time on this. It's a very serious, serious kind of matter I know for great numbers of \nworkers.\n\nCOOK: I think so too, Senator.\n\nKENNEDY: I'm concerned that if the employer is not -- is denying them the information about the dangers of this \nand then they only find out about it later, to have their opportunity to get some kind of remedy of this is being denied \nto them, I mean I have difficulty understanding how you reach the conclusion that the statute ran.\n\nCOOK: Actually, the plaintiff admits that he knew that he was and that he knew it probably was the beryllium from \nthe plant.  I mean he was inhaling gross amounts of this, and of course it is a horrible scenario, but it wasn't my \npersonal view about whether this individual deserved to recover.  It was simply an application of the well settled law \nthat it's not all the elements of a claim, which is what the majority held here.\n\nUntil this individual knew all the elements of their claim, they couldn't bring the case. But indeed this gentleman \nunfortunately both knew that he had an injury and he knew the likely cause.  It was later when he saw a web site \nsome five years later that he chose to bring the action, and I -- my considered judgment and I think reasoned \njudgment was that that was beyond the discovery rule and the particular statute of limitations here.\n\nOn the other hand, I can tell you of another case on the discovery rule involving NCR where I wrote the majority \nopinion that extended the discovery rule in that case and it was I think the first time in the country.  So, there are \noccasions -- there are always occasions where cases are decided differently based on the facts presented, and if \nyou're a jurist who attends to the law and tries to be diligent and conscientious about that, I think that you'll find the \ndecisions -- I can't do anything about which person wins and loses because I must be impartial.\n\nKENNEDY: Well, I agree that that has to be the desired standard. The majority, of course, found that the \nemployees' time to file suit started running from the time he found out the information his company had been \nwithholding and that the company doctors were misleading the worker.\n\nSo, you were in the dissent in making the judgment and the matter is that there's a pattern.  I mentioned several -- \nmy time is just expiring.  I mentioned several of these cases.  There are many others and, you know, when it comes \nout to the bottom line, it has virtually 100 percent on the one side.\n\nI agree that, you know, those aren't -- figures aren't always necessarily absolutely accurate but what we have is a \npretty significant pattern on here where in these cases involving workers in the cases that I've mentioned here, \nothers that your dissent always seemed to be at the expense of individual workers, in these cases workers' rights, \nand it's troubling.  My time is up.\n\nI want to thank you and I want to say to you, Ms. Cook, that if you want to provide other kinds of, you know, cases \nthat show a different side I'd welcome them.  I always try if I'm going to ask a nominee about cases, indicate what \nthey're going to be before hand.  I didn't have the chance just because of the way this was sort of working on this.  \nSo, if there are other cases that sustain, support yours, I'm more than glad to take a look at them.\n\nCOOK: Thank you.\n\nKENNEDY: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Thank you, Senator Kennedy.  Here's what we're going to do. Senator Schumer wants to ask some \nquestions and he will be here at eight o'clock, so we're going to -- I apologize to you that this is taking so long but I \ndo want to get this completed today because of -- for a variety of reasons but especially for you.  And, I want you to \nbe treated fairly and this committee I think is attempting to do that.\n\nSo what we're going to do is we're going to discontinue this part of the hearing until eight o'clock and that will give \nyou a chance. By the way, I've ordered some food.  If you can stick around I'd like to chat with you for a minute.  \nAnd, what we'd like to do at this point is to proceed to the three district court nominees and see if we can resolve \nthem at this point and then we'll resolve you after eight o'clock.\n\nKENNEDY: Can I just, Mr. Chairman, just again how we proceed is not up to all of you.  You've been gallant \nwitnesses today.  Mr. Roberts, I have not had a chance to question you.  We have other, I guess, Senator Schumer \nand others. I will submit questions to you.\n\nI appreciate your patience, all of our nominees, their patience with us.  It's been a long day for you and these are \ncomplicated and very important issues and I thank them.\n\nHATCH: Thank you, Senator Kennedy, for your kind remarks and (inaudible).\n\n(UNKNOWN): I just wanted to say I think you have been generous. I notice you did something very unusual in \nhaving 15 minute rounds. I'm not sure we've ever done that before.\n\nLEAHY: We've had a lot.\n\nHATCH: It's gone more than 15 minutes.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Senator Kennedy, I just noticed he was 13 minutes past his 15, which is all right.  You've been \ngenerous on that and I would just say this, that when President Clinton's nominees were coming by and there was a \nhearing set, if I had other committees or other responsibilities, I knew I had to either be there or not.  I didn't come in \nand expect, you know, the committee to adjust itself totally to my schedule.  But you've been generous and fair I \nbelieve and I wanted to say that for the record.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you Senator.  Let's take five minutes.\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Excuse me.  I'm sorry Senator Leahy.\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Chairman, you and I discussed this procedure and I think it is a wise way to do it.  I'm going to put it in.  \nWe have some other letters.  I know Mr. Sutton will be happy to know they're regarding him and we'll put those in \nthe record.\n\nHATCH: Without objection, we'll put those in the record.\n\nLEAHY: I would also note, Mr. Chairman, that you have been very fair on the clock.  I would also, I think that the \nSenator from Alabama and others would agree that President Bush's nominees during the time I was chairman if \nany one of them had any questions at any time on either side of the aisle they got whatever time they wanted, more \ntime to introduce or anything else, and several times we arranged the schedule so that all the state Senators could \nintroduce President Bush's nominees.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I think there's a lot of truth and sometimes we just had to resort to written questions because they \nwork too.\n\nHATCH: There were many times we did written questions because of the time constraints.  We've tried to be fair \nhere and I think we have been and you folks have been more than stalwart in being with us this long.  You're going \nto have to be here a little longer.\n\n\n\nHATCH: I apologize to you but this is an important hearing and my colleagues have felt like all three of you are \nquote controversial unquote.  So I don't agree with that assessment, but some feel that way and they have a right \nto feel that way if they want to.  So what we're going to do is we'll recess for just five minutes.  I want everybody \nback in five minutes and we'll start with the three district court nominees and we want you to here promptly at 8.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Court of appeals nominees can take off if they want, right?\n\nHATCH: Yeah, until 8 o'clock, but I'd like to see the three of you just for a minute (inaudible). Thank you.  With that \nwe're recessed for five minutes.\n\n(RECESS)\n\nHATCH: OK, we're going to reconvene.  If I can have you stand and hold up your right hands.  Do you solemnly \nswear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?\n\n(UNKNOWN): I do.\n\nHATCH: Thank you.  I'd like to welcome to the committee our three district nominees, Judge John Adams who has \nbeen nominated for the northern district of Ohio, Robert Junell (ph), who has been nominated for the western \ndistrict of Texas and Judge James Otero, who's been nominated for the central district of California.  It's been a \nlong day so far and you've been very, very patient and I'm very appreciative of you so in the interest of time, I'm \ngoing to enter my statement in the record and I'm going to enter my statement in the record and as soon as Senator \nLeahy gets here, we'll have him give any statement he cares to give.  But until then, maybe I can start with \nquestions.  Well, first of all, let me say it a little more courteously than that.  Why don't we start -- let's say, we had, \nwe had (inaudible) and we'll go with Judge Adams and Judge Otero and then Mr. Junell. If you'd care to make a \nstatement and introduce anybody who is here from your family.  They're probably all gone by now and perhaps \nbefore we begin maybe I'd like to turn to Senator DeWine to introduce Judge Adams.\n\nDEWINE: Thank you very much.  I deferred this morning Mr. Chairman introducing Judge Adams and it is my \npleasure to introduce really another fine Ohio nominee appearing before the committee today, Judge John Adams.  \nJudge Adams, we welcome you to the committee and we thank all of our nominees for their patience.  I know it's \nbeen a very, very long day.  Judge Adams from Akron has been nominated to be U.S. district judge for the northern \ndistrict of Ohio.  He currently serves as a judge on the court of common pleas in Summit County.  I'm pleased to \nwelcome Judge Adams' former law partner Philip Kaufman (ph) to the committee as well.\n\nJudge Adams is a 1978 graduate of Bowling Green State University where he earned a bachelor of science degree \nin education.  In 1983 he received his law degree from the University of Akron School of Law. While a student at \nAkron, Judge Adams clerked for Judge Spicer (ph) with the Summit County court of common pleas.  Following this \nposition, Judge Adams spent five years in private practice, during this time also served as assistant Summit County \nprosecutor. In 1989, Judge Adams returned to private practice as an associate and then a partner at the firm of \nKaufman and Kaufman (ph) in Akron.  Since 1999, Judge Adams has served as a judge on the court of common \npleas for Summit County.  In this position, Judge Adams has demonstrated that he's an intelligent, hard working \nand dedicated jurist.\n\nHe's well respected, both inside the courtroom and out and exhibits an excellent judicial temperament.  He's shown \nthat he has what it takes to be an excellent district court judge.  In endorsing his reelection effort just this last \nNovember, the \"Akron Beacon Journal\" stated that Judge Adams and I quote, has the potential to be a \ndistinguished Federal judge, building on the record of fairness and thoughtfulness that has marked his three years \non the county bench.  I agree completely, Mr. Chairman, with that sentiment.\n\nWhile Judge Adams' professional accomplishments are impressive by any measure, I would also like to take this \nopportunity to highlight his involvement in the Akron community.  Judge Adams has been a lifelong member of the \nNAACP.  He's also been active in the Summit County Mental Health Association and the Summit County Civil \nJustice Commission.\n\n\n\nIn summary, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on the committee to join me in support of these fine nominee -- of \nthis fine nominee (inaudible) from the state of Ohio.  I thank the chairman.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you Senator DeWine and that's high praise Judge Adams.  We'll turn to Senator Cornyn for his \ncomments for Mr. Junell.\n\nCORNYN: Mr. Chairman, I just want to add my brief comments to those made by Senator Hutchison this morning in \nintroducing Mr. Rob Junell, the nominee for the United States district court for the western district of Texas.  She \ntalked, Senator Hutchison talked primarily about Mr. Junell's legislative accomplishments and his personal \nbackground.  But just for the committee's information I first met Mr. Junell about 20 years ago when I was a young \nlawyer and he and I happened to be on the opposite side of a lawsuit.\n\nYou learn a lot about the character and the competence of your adversary in those circumstances and I wanted the \ncommittee to know and the record reflect the high regard in which I personally hold Mr. Junell as a lawyer, as a \nperson and a person who has devoted many years of his life to public service already who I know will do an \noutstanding job on the Federal bench and also his wife Beverly who's here with him today.  It seems like Mr. Junell \nyou were introduced a long time ago but just for a refresher and to add my comments and congratulations to you.  \nAnd thank you Mr. Chairman for that opportunity.\n\nHATCH: Thank you Senator.  Now we'll begin with Mr. Adams, then Mr. Otero and then Judge Adams, Judge Otero \nand then Mr. Junell.  And if you have any statements to make, we'd be happy to take them and if you would \nintroduce anyone who is accompanying you here.\n\nADAMS: Senator, first of all, I'd like to thank the committee for allowing us this hearing, this late day.  I know it's \nbeen a long day for you.  We greatly appreciate it.  I greatly appreciate the courtesy in being permitted to be heard \ntoday.  I want to acknowledge my former law partner who is here today Mr. Philip Kaufman, as Senator DeWine as \nacknowledged him.  Additionally, would like to acknowledge my father who could not be here today due to his age \nand somewhat age and somewhat unwillingness to travel here today and acknowledge the memory of my mother \nwho passed away some time ago and could not be here.  I'm sure she would be quite proud (inaudible) thank you \nSenator.\n\nHATCH: Thank you Judge, appreciate it. Judge Otero.\n\nOTERO: Thank you Senator.  I just want to thank the committee for having me here.  I'm very honored.  I'd like to \nthank Senator Leahy and Senator Feinstein for the gracious statements made earlier today and also to Senator \nBoxer for her written statement provided to the committee.  I'd like to thank my family, who's back there for being \nhere and also my parents who could not be here today because of health concerns.\n\nHATCH: Introduce your family to us.\n\nOTERO: We have my wife Jill is here.\n\nHATCH: Jill.\n\nOTERO: And my daughter Lauren (ph) and my son Evan.\n\nHATCH: Evan, happy to have you with us as well.\n\nOTERO: Thank you.\n\nHATCH: Thank you sir.  Mr. Junell.\n\nJUNELL: Thank you Mr. Chairman.  It is indeed an honor to be here today.  I want to thank both you and Senator \nLeahy for allowing us to be here for this hearing and I want to thank Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn, the \ntwo senators from Texas that said such nice things.  My wife Beverly is here with a crutch from knee surgery.  She \nhurt the other one, Senator at Snowbird about 10 years ago.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Oh my goodness (inaudible)\n\nJUNELL: \u2026  in your state and this time it was in New Mexico so she's recently had surgery.  My\u2026\n\n(UNKNOWN): Should have skied in Vermont.\n\nHATCH: No, no that's worse there, just plain ice there.  We've had powder snow.\n\nJUNELL: My son Ryan, who is in California, could not be with us. My daughter Keith (ph) is in the Peace Corps in \nBolivia and my son Clay is a student at Angelo State University in San Angelo.\n\nHATCH: Well, we're honored to have all of you with us and we again apologize for this taking so long, but it's the \nnature of this place that every once in a while it does take a little bit of time, so please forgive us.  I think we'll begin \nwith Senator Leahy.  He has been so patient all day.  I'm going to turn to him first and then whatever questions he \ndoesn't ask, maybe the rest of us can.\n\nLEAHY: Well, thank you Mr. Chairman.  I would try to brief with each, however the level of controversy is a lot \ndifferent here. Judge Adams, you've been actively involved in partisan politics on behalf of your fellow Republicans.  \nYou've served as elected official.  You've contributed to Republican campaigns.  You've volunteered campaigns. \nYou've run for city council, all of which is perfectly appropriate, but when you go to the Federal bench, you have no \nproblem with the fact that partisan activity then is -- it's gone, is that correct?\n\nADAMS: Absolutely Senator and I think as a common pleas court judge, my record will establish that that's certainly \nbeen the case while on the bench.\n\nLEAHY: And can you assure us that if somebody walked into your court if you're confirmed, that they would not \nhave to worry about whether they were the right political party, the wrong political party. They would just have to \nworry that Judge Adams reads the law correctly.\n\nADAMS: Absolutely Senator.  You can rest assured in that regard.\n\nLEAHY: You, in private practice you specialized estate planning and trusts and probate law.  You had a special \nemphasis on providing service to senior citizens and people with mental and physical disabilities.  I commend you \nfor that.  What do you bring from that, the work you did with people with disabilities? What do you bring from that as \nyou go into a Federal bench?\n\nADAMS: Well, I think I bring a couple things that I've learned from my representation of seniors and folks with \ndisabilities.  I've learned how important it is to listen.  I think as a judge one of the most important things that we \noverlook is how important it is to take time to listen to the litigants, to the parties, their attorneys. Sometimes I think \nwe as judges overstate our own importance and I think I've learned a great deal in representing seniors.  In my life I \nhave always enjoyed listening to their life experiences and I think I've learned a lot from them and gleaned a lot \nfrom them and from their life experiences and it's given me balance in my life, in my views from the bench.\n\nLEAHY: Thank you.  And I think you're right.  It's very easy for a judge who sits there -- you know, it's all rise and \nall that kind of thing that I think the judges are best when they hear the all rise they almost have to stop themselves \nto see who it is they're doing that for and not take it for granted and the judge that keep themselves fairly grounded \nin their community end up being the best judges.  I mean there are a lot of things you have to give up as a judge.  I \nlove politics and I'm sure you do too, giving up some of those things.  You have to be careful of your associations, \nlike any member of the bar, a lot of your friends are going to be lawyers.  You have to be -- pick and choose there.  \nBut you're not really in a monastery.  I mean you're still a human being and the most important thing is that the \npeople who are in front of the bench are also human beings and so I appreciate that.\n\nJudge Otero, you've served as judge for the last 14 years and correct me if I'm wrong in this, first in the Los Angeles \nmunicipal court and then on the Los Angeles superior court.\n\nOTERO: (inaudible)\n\n\n\nLEAHY: I spent -- years ago in the superior court when I was a prosecutor and one of my fellow board members, \nthe national DAs was the district attorney of Los Angeles and (inaudible) go into some of those courts and realize \nthat Los Angeles is larger than my jurisdiction in Vermont or what was my jurisdiction.  I do get out there now and \nthen.  I have a son, a former Marine and his wife who live in Los Angeles in the Los Pelos (ph) area and I don't think \nthere's just about any kind of case anybody's ever going to see that hasn't been in the Los Angeles superior court at \none time or another.\n\nOTERO: That's correct.  We may be the largest court system in the United States if not the world.\n\nLEAHY: I think it's an extraordinary court system. I know a lot of the people I see who come here from other \ncountries to study our judicial system, that's one of the places they want to go to and you've probably seen a lot of \nforeign representatives come to your court to see it.\n\nOTERO: From China recently and from Japan also.\n\nLEAHY: One thing that we talk about, the impartiality of our Federal judiciary, one thing I think might interest you.  \nWhen the Soviet Union broke up, a group of Soviet or now Russian lawmakers came here to meet with me, with \nSenator Hatch, others and I remember one question one of them asked, almost incredulously.  He said we've heard \nthat in the United States there have been times when the government has been sued and the government actually \nlost.  I mean didn't you quickly replace the judge? And we had to explain to him, no, we have a certain \nindependence here and yes, the government does lose on occasions and I think this was probably as big an eye \nopener as ever. But what I've always encouraged these people to go out to Los Angeles and watch your court \nsystem.\n\nNow a number of issues of the death penalty have come up. Justice O'Connor said there were serious questions \nabout whether the death penalty is fairly administered in the U.S. She added the system may well be allowing some \ninnocent defendants to be executed.  Now you've presided over a capital murder case.  One case you presided \nover, People vs. Chante (ph) Beasley (ph) (inaudible) jury returned a guilty verdict against the three defendants, \nrecommended death.  You had the sentencing hearing.  You sentenced two of the defendants to death.  You \nrejected the jury's recommendation of death for the third defendant.  You sentenced him to life without possibility of \nparole.\n\nAnd I'm not asking you what was your reasoning in that case, but you've obviously had to look at the question of the \ndeath penalty.  Do you think there are changes that are warranted in the way the death penalty is administered?  \nNone of us are questioning that it's constitutional.  The Supreme Court's held so.  But are there changes that should \nbe made in capital cases or are they are all in your experience, always fairly handled?\n\nOTERO: I would hesitate to comment about the particular case that was just before the California supreme court.\n\nLEAHY: I don't want you to comment about that one, but I mentioned it only because you've obviously focused your \nattention here.\n\nOTERO: I think as judges we have to be very concerned about the rights of defendants, especially in capital cases.  \nI think the entire issue is probably better handled by the legislature.  As judges it's our duty to follow the law and \ninterpret the law to the best of our abilities. In California, we have a system that allows the trial judge to conduct an \nindependent review of the aggravated and mitigating factors to sit as a 13th juror on the penalty phase and I think \nthat's a very good system.\n\nLEAHY: Do you feel that it's an absolute that in a -- especially in a capital case, that a judge should make sure that \nthere is adequate counsel, I mean real counsel for the defense?\n\nOTERO: Well, absolutely, absolutely Senator.\n\nLEAHY: We can assume the state law (INAUDIBLE) in a capital case, but and that if there is evidence available, \nincriminating or exculpatory, that is be available to both sides.\n\n\n\nOTERO: Absolutely.  One of the fundamentals of our system is to make sure that all evidence is turned over to both \nsides.\n\nLEAHY: The reason I say that, there have been some states and some jurisdictions that has not happened or \nwhere the least competent counsel has been appointed and a small flat fee in a capital case and that's where we \nhave problems.  You have probably found, as certainly has been my experience, I think Senator Hatch's experience \nand Senator DeWine's in trying cases, you actually have a far easier time of it if you have good counsel on both \nsides.\n\nOTERO: Good lawyers make for a better trial judge, absolutely.\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Junell, we were chatting earlier and I repeated the call I received from Congressman Stenholm who \nassured me in his estimation you would be a fair judge no matter who was before you.  I want to ask for a moment \nabout your work as a state legislator, a claim (ph) a whistleblower named George Green (ph).  In August of '89, he \nwas employed at the Texas Department of Human Services.  He reported what he thought was corruption among \nhis superiors and others.  The state of Texas responded by investigating him and firing him.  Then they indicted him \nand the indictment was the charge eventually dropped.  He sued under the Texas whistleblower statute.  A jury \nawarded him $13.6 million.  In February '94, the Texas supreme court affirmed that judgment saying the state did \nnot have immunity because of the Texas whistleblower law.  Under state law, to collect the jury award, Mr. Green \nwas required to get his claim approved by the state legislature.  He tried to do that.  You were chairman of the \nTexas House appropriations committee.  You refused to approve the full amount which had grown to around $19 \nmillion with interest and offered him 25 percent or 25 cents on the dollar.  You were quoted as saying that the state \nof Texas doesn't owe him this money under the law of sovereign immunity.  We don't have to pay. The Texas \nlegislature eventually gave him a substantial portion of that.\n\nI raise this because this committee has heard from people like Sharon Watkins (ph) who opted to expose many of \nthe misdeeds of Enron (INAUDIBLE) FBI Special Agent Colette (ph) Riley brought public attention to some of the \nshortcomings in the Department of Justice prior to 9/11.  Senator Grassley and I have worked on this, been very \nmuch of a bipartisan thing on whistleblowers.  A lot of people will risk everything to point out waste or corruption and \nso on.\n\nSo one, why did you want to deny Mr. Green his full award.  Do you think it deterred other whistleblowers?\n\nOTERO: No Senator and I appreciate you asking that question.  No it didn't.  Texas law at that time for the state of \nTexas ran over somebody in a truck out on the highway.  The amount of damages that could be recovered for \nsomeone who has perished or who was made a quadriplegic is $250,000.  In the case of the whistleblower act \nwhich was passed before I came to the legislature, there was not a cap on the damages, but it did require a review \nby the legislature, somewhat like this process of presidential appointees being reviewed with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate and of this committee.\n\nLEAHY: Well, we're written into the Constitution, the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOTERO: We're written into the statute in the same manner. We're written into statute that all awards of that nature, \nif there was not a permission to sue prior to the time the suit was brought, had to come to the legislature to apply for \nmoney.  We held hearings on Mr. Green's case.  I don't want to -- spent a lot of time reading trial testimony and \nreviewing all of his case, ultimately participated in the amount and Senator I don't remember the amount that it was \nultimately settled for.  It was in the millions of dollars though. The legislature either that session or the next session \nrevised the statute to put the cap the same that we have on our tort claim act as well.\n\nLEAHY: So now you can only return a quarter of a million?\n\nOTERO: Yes sir.  But I can tell you that we have active, not only at the state level, but at the county level and at the \ncity level and any political subdivision is covered by that and it has not deterred anyone to my knowledge.  I've \nnever heard that anyone's been deterred of reporting wrongdoing in government.\n\n\n\nLEAHY: You have a -- there you got a specific statute to review. A trial judge can review the question of damages, \nthe juror awards. Is that something a trial judge should eagerly jump in to do or should he be reluctant to overturn or \nchange a jury verdict?\n\nOTERO: I think they should be very reluctant to overturn a jury verdict.\n\nLEAHY: I do too.  If I have other questions I will submit them for the record.  You've been patient.  Your family has \nbeen patient. Senator Hatch has the patience of Job sometimes.\n\nHATCH: Sometimes, that's for sure. And today is one of them, that's all I can say.  And you've had patience and \nwe've been very grateful to have here (ph).  I know all three of you, how good you are.  I know your reputations.  I \nhave no real desire to put you through any more questions.  All I can say is that just one little thought and Mr. \nJunell, I understand that you're quite well read and that you have excellent taste in books.  I'd just like to know the \nlast book that you've read.\n\nJUNELL: You know, one of my favorite books Mr. Chairman is \"The Square Peg.\"\n\n(UNKNOWN): Oh my God.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Hold that man over.\n\nHATCH: I think everybody should read that, including Senator Leahy.\n\nLEAHY: I'm halfway through it.\n\nJUNELL: I understand they're going to make a movie by the way.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Oh yeah, I imagine.\n\nJUNELL: Tom Cruise is looking to play\u2026\n\nHATCH: I see, I should be so lucky, but thank you.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I would have been able to finish the book today if you hadn't kept us here so long. That's one of my \ngreatest disappointments.\n\nHATCH: I have a feeling I'm going to support you Mr. Junell. I'm going to support all three of you.  We're grateful \nthat you're willing to take these jobs.  We know that it's really a sacrifice for people like yourselves that take these \njobs.  But yet they're extremely important for our society.  Without these Federal district court judges, our society \nwouldn't exist nearly as well as it does.\n\nLet me just say that, one thing that I caution you on as an attorney who tried a lot in Federal courts, there seems to \nbe a little syndrome that happens sometimes when Federal district judges and circuit judges, well frankly all the way \nto the top.  Once they're on the court for just a little while, they seem to begin to think they have elements of deity \nand we just want to make sure that you three don't get that attitude.  Just remember -- and don't try cases for the \nother attorneys. When a young attorney's there and he or she might not understand the evidence as well, you can \nhelp them.  But don't try their cases for them.  And be patient and don't let being a Federal judge go to your head.  \nThat's one bit of caution that I'd tell you. And I've seen it happen in some many cases, even with really dear friends \nof mine that -- where they just.  And part of it is because you have to make decisions all the time and you have to \nsometimes draw a line and sometimes you get so that you get used to that.  But I think it's very important that you \nhelp everybody concerned and do justice in the courts and I have a great feeling that all three of you will.  So with \nthat\u2026\n\n(UNKNOWN): May I note for the record, deification never happens at the 100 members of the U.S. Senate, you'll \nunderstand.\n\n\n\nHATCH: That's right.  What we're going to do is we will probably put you on the next markup Thursday after this \none and hopefully, anybody on the committee has a right to put people over or put any item on the markup agenda \nover for a week.  It's an automatic right on the committee and it's a very important rule.  But hopefully no one will \nput you over for a week.  But with that, if they do put you over for a week in about two weeks, we hopefully will \nhave you out of committee.  Then we have to get you on the floor and we'll work on that as well.\n\nSo we'll do our very best to push this process along and to -- and I intend to do that and when there's a Democrat \npresent as well. I tried to do it and I think we did do it to a large degree with President Clinton.  It wasn't perfect but \nwe did move a lot of judges for him.  He became second only to Reagan, the all time champion and only five less \nthan Reagan.  But nevertheless, I wish we could have done better and both Senator Leahy and I are committed to \ntrying to change this atmosphere to where we can -- however is president, will be given tremendous consideration \non his or her selection of judges.\n\nSo with that, we're grateful for your patience.  Because of it, you really haven't had to spend any awful lot of time \nwith us and that's a great blessing.  Think about it.  With that we'll recess.\n\nLEAHY: And I have heard of absolutely no objection on our side of the aisle to these three so I suspect you're going \nto be able to keep to that schedule without people putting them over.\n\nHATCH: We're going to try and then we'll try and get you up on the floor immediately thereafter.  I just want to thank \nSenator DeWine for his leadership on this committee and he hasn't asked any questions anymore than the rest of \nus and frankly, he plays a great role on this committee and Mr. Adams, you're lucky to have him as your senator, as \nwell as Senator Voinovich.\n\nWith that, we're going to recess until 8 o'clock.  I do have pizza back here for everybody who's concerned so please \ndrop in and have some if you can, OK.  With that we'll recess until 8 o'clock.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Thank you.\n\n(RECESS)\n\nHATCH: OK, it's 8 o'clock.  We're ready to go again and hopefully we won't be too long but it's just whatever time it \ntakes. I want to be fair to the other side and I know this an ordeal for the three of you to be here this long.  You've \nbeen here almost 12 hours, so 10 1/2 hours and we'll hopefully finish within the near future. We'll do our best.\n\nSenator Leahy, do you have any more questions you want to ask?\n\nLEAHY: Chairman, I understand Senator Durbin was here just a moment ago and I just don't want to start into his \ntime.\n\nHATCH: OK, all right.\n\nLEAHY: Dick, why don't you come on up here?\n\nHATCH: We'll turn to Senator Durbin now for any questions he might have.\n\nDURBIN: Thank you very much.  I'd like to ask this question of the three of you.  It's an observation which was \nmade several years ago relative to the issue of racial profiling.  I know if I ask you what your position is on racial \nprofiling what you'd say, what we'd all say.  We're opposed to it.  It's not just.  It's not fair.  We certainly don't want it \nin America.  But I came across some statistics which trouble me and I have asked virtually every nominee at all \nsorts of levels, Department of Justice and Judiciary for a reaction and what they think we should do about the \nfollowing.\n\nI want to make sure I get these numbers right as I give them to you.  I'm just trying to remember them off the top of \nmy head.  But we have a situation in America today where 12 percent of our population are African-Americans.  The \nDrug Enforcement Administration believes that 11 percent of the drug users in America are African-American. But \n\n\n\n35 percent of those arrested for drug violations are African- American, 53 percent of those convicted in state courts \nfor drug felonies are African-American and 58 percent of those currently incarcerated in state prison for drug felony \nare African-Americans. I'd like your reaction to that.  You are asking for a major position in the administration of \njustice and if we are honest about our opposition to racial profiling, what do these numbers mean in terms of our \nsystem of justice and in general terms and in specific terms, the whole question of minimum mandatory sentencing \nand Justice Cook, you've been on the Supreme Court in Ohio.  I'd like to hear your reaction.\n\nCOOK: I've not heard those statistics but that's -- I suppose like anyone that's disturbing and what it tells me is that \nwhat I already knew primarily is that we have to be vigilant in reviewing cases for the typical issues that would go \nwith profiling, be the probable cause and the suppression issues and to see if there's anything in the work that we're \ndoing that would contribute to those statistics if indeed that folks by their race are being targeted for law \nenforcement without justification.  I think that's the only role that I play in that problem with the Supreme Court, but \ncertainly, even just as a citizen I think anybody would be upset to hear those numbers and to be concerned if there \nis something that we could be doing and as I say, I only know that I can be looking carefully at my cases which I \nactually hope that I already do.  But that is, I guess I find those numbers a lot higher than I would have thought.\n\nDURBIN: Mr. Roberts.\n\nROBERTS: I think that sort of statistical disparity ought to spark further inquiry.  I mean it sort of points out we have \na potential problem here and I think you want to find out what's behind the numbers because any statistical \ngrouping that shows that kind of disparity would suggest that there may be a problem not treating people as \nindividuals and that's sort of at the core of our constitutional liberties, that we don't group people according to \ncharacteristics and say well, you share this characteristic and so you must be like this, this and this.  We treat \npeople as individuals, no matter how compelling the statistical evidence may be, shows that whatever group it is \nand 99 whatever percent here is, that's not what due process means.  That's not what liberty means.  That's not \nwhat the various protections of the Bill of Rights mean, that you're part of a group that more often than not is \nsubject to this or does this and therefore we're going to treat you as a member of the group rather than an \nindividual.  So it's -- that type of disparity I think is one that ought to concern people and spark interest and cause \npeople to look and see what's behind the numbers and why that's the case.\n\nDURBIN: Professor Sutton, would you like to comment?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I agree with all of those comments.  They are disturbing statistics and they do deserve inquiry to \nfind out what's behind them and I just think it's a very important subject for inquiry.  From my own personal \nexperience, my uncle is Lebanese and lives in this country and his kids of course are part Lebanese and the issue \nof racial profiling is not lost on them.  I know it does relate directly to the issue you raised but it does relate to the \nunderlying point of potentially making assessments about someone based solely on their background and their \nappearance and that deserves a lot of inquiry.\n\nDURBIN: I mentioned minimum mandatory sentences and there's a lot to be said and Senator Sessions for \nexample has some views on it. We have -- may differ a little bit.  But I wonder, I'll just tell you my experience.  In \ngoing to a women, a Federal women's prison in Pekin (ph), Illinois and looking at the prison population.  It is an eye \nopener.  You will find in that prison women who are generally in their 40s and 50s sitting around knitting afghans, \nserving 12-to-20-year mandatory sentences because they were ratted out by boyfriends who were trying to find \nsome way to reduce their own culpability for drug crimes.  And when you talk to judges about this, they say, why do \nyou do this to us?  Why do you put us in this position where the prosecutor, doing their job, ends up with charging a \ncrime that puts a person in prison at the expense of taxpayers for an incredible period of time.  That person being \nno threat, really no threat to society. Professor Sutton, what do you think of minimum mandatory sentencing?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I think that for quite a few reasons states among others are reconsidering them because of the \nproblem of overflows in prisons and state budgets that are preventing the very thing that you're suggesting is \nhappening, of some form of mandatory minimum, whether it's Federal or state law and the prison population that as \nyou suggest may involve a lot of people that don't belong in prison anymore.  I think from the perspective of a judge, \nit's not as easy to solve that problem as one might like.  I do think there's a lot that the legislature, whether it's the \n\n\n\nnational legislature, Congress or state legislatures.  But I do agree with you that it's hard to imagine anything worse \nthan someone in prison who really doesn't belong there, could be serving society well, contributing to society and \nyet still in prison.  That's quite sad.\n\nDURBIN: Mr. Roberts.\n\nROBERTS: I guess my first comment would be, it strikes me as a general matter a quintessential legislative policy \njudgment, what the sentence for a crime is going to be and whether a judge is going to have discretion in \nsentencing or whether there's going to be a mandatory minimum.  I know there are constitutional issues at the \nmargin and those have been addressed in some cases.  But it's a policy judgment.  I guess my own reading in the \narea has led me to think that it's one of those areas where the consequences of the policy judgments are not \nalways apparent.\n\nFor example, I do know that in many areas it has had an enormous impact on prosecutorial decisions.  It gives \ngreat leverage and you find one constant, a lot of people are pleading to different offensive and so when you look at \nsomeone's record and you say, well, you've never done this before.  It turns out he in fact has been arrested for it \nprobably four times, but he's not prosecuted because it's easy for the prosecutor to leverage the mandatory \nminimum to a different plea. And the situation you discussed as well where you have codefendants. I just think the \npolicy consequences are often pretty far downstream and as Mr. Sutton mentioned, we're beginning to see some of \nthose play out and some people, some legislatures are revisiting the question.\n\nDURBIN: Justice Cook, instead of asking you that question, I'm going to run out of time and I'd like to direct one \nquestion to you as I did to Professor Sutton that really goes to the heart of many of the objections to your \nnomination.  When I was a practicing attorney as fresh out of law school and our little firm in a downstate town in \nIllinois represented a railroad and we had a Federal judge in our home town who was a railroad dream come true.  \nWe would go into his courtroom.  He would suck on lemon drops, stare at the ceiling and rule on us in our favor on \neverything.  This was perfect and we made sure that we removed everything to Federal court and we did a great job \nrepresenting our railroad.\n\nSo there's some judges who come to this with certain feelings and certain inclinations which become very obvious \nin the way they do their business every single day.  When I take a look at Professor Sutton and the disability \ncommunity coming out today, I take a look at the letters that we've received and you've seen them, from women's \ngroups and employee-sponsored groups who in looking at the totality of your record, think they have detected a \ndisturbing trend, that when it comes to cases that compensate people injured or cases involving employee \ndiscrimination, that more often than not, you will be staring at the ceiling and ruling against them.\n\nNow my friend Senator DeWine has pointed out the exceptions to that rule, but clearly there are a lot of cases we \nhave gathered here which prove the case. I'd like to give you a chance and you've probably had that chance before, \nbut at this moment, to express your defense of your record as the dissenting justice on the Ohio supreme court.\n\nCOOK: My defense Senator is that I -- it's a simple defense and it's an honest one.  I take each case and look at the \nfactors that I need to review and I said, obviously I look at the record.  I look at the briefs, study them.  I look at the \nlaw and particularly the text and using logic and rules and custom, I come to the conclusion that the law dictates.  I \nrule as the law is and I think sometimes that is viewed as I'm ruling how I would like to rule or how I would like the \nlaw to be and it's just not the case.  I follow the statutes in Ohio and in honesty anybody who thoroughly reviews the \nrecord would find that the statutes in Ohio in the general assembly in Ohio is a conservative legislature and I follow \nthe law that they set forth and I don't know about any patterns.  I know that I've read those web sites and I just \nthink, because I think, I can tell you chapter and verse about each and every one of those cases and it's some \nprinciple of law that dictated where I went, not any antipathy for any party nor any favoring. And I hope that a \nthorough review of the record would actually show you that that's the case.\n\nDURBIN: Thank you very much.  Thank you Mr. Chairman.\n\nHATCH: Thank you Senator Durbin.  Senator Leahy.\n\n\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Roberts, we had last year, we had White House counsel Fred Fielding (ph) testify here and \n(INAUDIBLE) hoped that the administration nominate any liberals to the court. I suspect that you would not have to \nstay awake nights worrying about that. That's why when you worked at in President Reagan's White House on \njudicial selection, did you ever ask potential nominees about his or her views on any issue such as political or \nideological views?\n\nROBERTS: No, Senator, not at all.  If I remember, I'm trying to remember specific questions.  One thing we tried to \ndo was pose hypotheticals, the purpose of which was to put a situation where the legal answer was A, but what this \ncandidate might think we would regard as the politically more appealing result was B.  And if that candidate said B, \nthat's how, that would raise concerns with us because we'd think somebody wouldn't follow the law, but would \ninstead follow politics.\n\nSometimes we would tend to -- at least I did, when I would sit down with the folks, focus on particular things in their \nresume.  If they'd written an article or a book, we'd say tell us about that. What's that about, really just to see how \ntheir way of reasoning went. But I at least never asked about particular cases or issues that might come before the \ncourt.\n\nLEAHY: Did you have any candidates give you the political versus the legal answer?\n\nROBERTS: Some, yes.\n\nLEAHY: Did they make it through?\n\nROBERTS: No, I don't know of a single case where they did and you know, it wasn't -- a number of people would \ndo -- I obviously was fairly junior and I don't know that my views were regarded as determinative, but we would \nmeet and discuss it and we would say, this is what he did and he said he'd do this and that would raise concerns \nbecause at least at that, in that situation, we weren't looking for people who were going to follow politics.  We were \nlooking for judges who were going to follow the rule of law.\n\nLEAHY: If the political result might be something that the Reagan White House might have liked.\n\nROBERTS: Well, that's what we tried to come up with in the hypothetical so that they would think\u2026\n\nLEAHY: It's a good way\u2026\n\nROBERTS: They want me to say this and\u2026\n\nLEAHY: It's an impressive way of doing it.\n\nROBERTS: Well, I don't know how effective it was, but it was I think effective in weeding some people out.\n\nLEAHY: That's very interesting.  When you returned to private practice, you took on the United Mine Workers vs. \nBagwell (ph) case. That's where if I recall right, the union had contempt fines for over 60 million, 64 million, \nsomething like that for strike activities. You were on the side opposed to them and -- opposed to the union. I've \nbeen told that your fellow D.C.  circuit court nominee, your former colleague in the solicitor general's office, Miguel \nEstrada, sought out the opportunity for the Justice Department to intervene on the same side as yours as I recall \nand correct me if I'm wrong in these facts.  The supreme court rule against your side and said that fines of that \nmagnitude could not constitutionally be imposed by a judge without a jury trial.  Was that sort of the crux of their\u2026\n\nROBERTS: My recollection of that case, I recall cases I won a lot more clearly than cases that I lost, but if\u2026\n\nLEAHY: We all (inaudible)\n\nROBERTS: If I'm remembering it correctly, I think the fundamental issue was whether the contempt citations in that \ncase were properly characterized as civil contempt or it should be regarded as criminal contempt, which would carry \n\n\n\nwith it the additional protections and the court -- I think we were arguing for civil and the court ruled in favor of \ncriminal.\n\nLEAHY: Is that 64 million was, they'd better get a jury in there to\u2026\n\nROBERTS: Well, it was, it was the type of civil contempt sanction judges often impose which was, it's going to be \n1,000 or whatever\u2026\n\nLEAHY: X number of dollars per day.\n\nROBERTS: (inaudible) a day until you come into compliance and it added up and I was defending I believe at that \ntime, I don't remember exactly what the office was, but whoever it was that was enforcing the contempt for the court \nand\u2026\n\nLEAHY: (inaudible)\n\nROBERTS: a good a job as we could and\u2026\n\nLEAHY: You were on the Bagwell side.\n\nROBERTS: I was trying to remember what his office was.  I think he was appointed to enforce the contempt citation \nthat the court issued.\n\nLEAHY: What was Mr. Estrada's involvement?\n\nROBERTS: He if I recall, he was in the solicitor general's office at the time and the question -- they were \nparticipating as an amicus I think in the case, along with the deputy solicitor general Paul Bender (ph).  I remember \nMr. Bender argued the -- for the Federal government.\n\nLEAHY: And do you feel he was active in getting the government to get involved on your side of the case?\n\nROBERTS: Well, I don't remember any meetings.  I certainly would have.  I don't actually remember.  I would have \ncontacted the Justice Department and said this is something you should be in our -- for the legal principle, you \nshould be arguing on our side.  But I don't remember any particular involvement by Mr. Estrada.\n\nLEAHY: You've told NPR you support an originalist (ph) approach to constitutional interpretation, saying the reason \nthat that's the way it was in 1789 is not a bad one when you're talking about construing the Constitution.  Of course \nthe Constitution in 1789 did not have the Bill of Rights.  We would not -- to get it ratified, you couldn't get it ratified, \nthe states wouldn't have ratified it without that.  It allow African-Americans to be enslaved back then.  We had the \ncivil war amendments like the 14th, which limited state power to make or enforce laws to deny equal protection to \npeople.  So the originalist's concept can't be an exact one, can it?\n\nROBERTS: No. And I don't remember exactly what the issue was, what they were discussing at that point.  And I\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Why don't you (ph) just tell me what your philosophy is on that.\n\nROBERTS: Well, I think I'd have to say that I don't have an overarching uniform philosophy.  To take a very simple \nexample to make the point, I think we are all literal texturalists when it comes to a provision in the Constitution that \nsays it takes a 2/3 vote to do something.  You don't look at what was the intent behind that and you know, given \nthat intent, one half ought to be enough.  On the other hand, there are certain areas where literalism along those \nlines obviously doesn't work.  If you're dealing with the 4th amendment, is something an unreasonable search and \nseizure.  The text is only going to get you so far and in those situations\u2026\n\nLEAHY: There aren't too many wiretaps in 1789.\n\nROBERTS: Exactly and even basic concepts like commerce didn't have to deal with air travel and things of that \nsort. That doesn't mean they're not covered by the commerce clause.  Our Constitution is flexible enough to \n\n\n\naccommodate technological changes of that sort. And I think in some areas, for example, the Supreme Court's \njurisprudence on the jury trial right.\n\nI argued a case in favor of the jury trial right in the Supreme Court and I learned more history than I thought I'd ever \nsee again after being a history major in college, because what the Supreme Court has said is you look at what \nhappened at common law at the point in time when the 7th amendment was adopted and if it was on the equity \nside, you don't get the jury.  If it was on the law side you do.  So you read a lot of old history.  That doesn't mean \nthat that same approach is going to make sense when you're dealing with other provisions of the Constitution.  So I \nthink I'd have to say that I don't have an overarching guiding way of reading the Constitution.  I think different \napproaches are appropriate in different types of constitutional provisions.\n\nLEAHY: Mr. Chairman, I -- you know I'm very concerned having three nominees of this nature that as controversial \nhowever defined all at once.  We saw what happened with the three district court judges.  It took us about 20 \nminutes to hear them where there was controversy.  By having the three on a day where there's other things going \non for all of us, I think has created a problem. Obviously we're going to want time to get the transcript and to submit \nwritten questions.  I assume you have no objection to that.\n\nHATCH: Well\u2026\n\nLEAHY: How are they going to get the transcript over night?\n\nHATCH: Do you think you will?  We'll have the transcript -- if we can have the transcript by 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'd \nfeel good about it.\n\nLEAHY: And again, a week to\u2026\n\nHATCH: Well not if you can do it, but I don't want you to kill yourself.  Four o'clock is fine and then see that would \nbe Thursday and we certainly, we'd have Friday, Monday\u2026\n\nLEAHY: Tuesday.\n\nHATCH: I think if we can have\u2026\n\nLEAHY: I think because it's already extremely important (inaudible) we ought to have time at least to get the \nquestions out.\n\nHATCH: Well, I think\u2026\n\nLEAHY: I'm going to urge our side not to be dilatory in any way. I don't think anybody will but we\u2026\n\nHATCH: Well, if we can have the transcript by tomorrow at 4, then that would give the rest of the day, then Friday, \nthen Monday and if we can have the questions in by Tuesday at 5 o'clock, then I'd hope you could get some answer \nright back, because I would like to put you on the next Thursday after tomorrow markup.  Now it's very likely that \nsomebody on the committee would put all three of you over (inaudible) to give even additional time to our \ncolleagues, but that's what I have in mind and I hope -- I think it's fair and I hope it will work well for you.  And we've \nbeen chatting about the reasonable time here and what -- we'll work on that basis.\n\nLEAHY: And Mr. Sutton, earlier today you said that if you were confirmed as a judge, you'd probably see the world \nthrough other peoples' eyes.  Try and imagine what it would be like to be on the other side of the case that came \nbefore you.  So think, imagine you're Pat Garrett (ph) or J.  Daniel Kimel (ph) from (inaudible) west side mother, any \ndisabled person, senior citizen, women or low-income child. They're coming in knowing that you've been involved in \ncourt decisions which denied (inaudible) individual remedies for their claims.  Can they walk or their counterparts \nwalk into a court but not Professor Jeffrey Sutton argue the case as a litigant, but Judge Jeffrey Sutton sitting on a \nthree-judge panel or en banc and they look at you and say, are they going to say, I'm dead or are they going to say, \nI got a chance.\n\n\n\nSUTTON: Well, I can promise you that if I were fortunate to be confirmed, I would do everything I could to become \nthe kind of judge that I want to become and that's a judge that is not thought of as a Republican appointee, a \nDemocratic appointee, someone who works for a state government, someone who worked private practice on this \nor that side of the case.  That's the whole objective.  That's exactly why one would want to seek the honor of this \nparticular position.\n\nI would hope if someone chose to look at some of my representation, that they perhaps didn't care for, that they \nwould look at the rest of my representations and I think if they looked at all of them, by the time they walked into my \ncourtroom, even if I were lucky enough to be confirmed the very first day, I think if they looked at all of those, looked \nat all the briefs I've worked on, looked at all of my associations, my role in the Equal Justice Foundation, I'm quite \nconfident that they would be comfortable and I can assure you that this is exactly the task I would want to take on.\n\nAs an appellate advocate, it is true you've got a client to represent and you're obligated to further their interest in \nevery way you can, but even while you're beholding to them, and to seeking relief for that particular side of the \ncase, one cannot be an effective advocate if one is a true believer.  Those are the worst advocates.\n\nThe best advocates and I'm not saying I'm one.  I've just tried to be like the best advocates, are the advocates that \nin arguing a case to the court, can show that they do appreciate both sides of the case, do appreciate the way nine \ndifferent justices might look at an issue.  While I'm sure I've failed at times, I've really worked hard in the cases I've \ndone at the U.S. Supreme Court and in other courts to do that very thing so I actually think in some ways appellate \nadvocacy has been helpful training for this very type of job and learning how to see the world through other peoples' \nperspectives.\n\nLEAHY: Well if somebody is coming in there seeking compensation under a law the Congress has passed that \nallows compensation, their rights are violated, assuming all the things, jury agrees and so on. Are they going to \nhave to worry based on as you said, positions you've advocated for and so on, that they're going to have somebody \nwho's going to have a view the Congress didn't have that authority in the first place?\n\nSUTTON: Absolutely not and you know, maybe one day if I'm lucky enough to get to the court of appeals, I'll prove \nit and we'll see a dissenting opinion from something I've written and the dissenting opinion cites an article or a brief \nI've advocated.  I hope I'll be able to prove that one day.\n\nLEAHY: Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I understand that Mr. Schumer is coming down the hall.\n\nHATCH: We'll be glad to wait until he gets here.\n\nLEAHY: And I'll submit my other questions for the record and I appreciate not only the witnesses' time but their \nfamilies' patience throughout this and that little jolt of nutritional pizza provided by the chairman.  If there's ever a \ntime we needed something to clog our arteries it was tonight.\n\nHATCH: That wasn't what I\u2026\n\nLEAHY: But I noticed you ate an equal amount and so I knew it was safe.\n\nSESSIONS? : Mr. Chairman, we'll have to get Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy on our bill to reform the minimum \nmandatory sentences for crack cocaine and provide some better balance that we've worked on that would reduce in \na number of ways the severity of the penalties and balance some other equities in that manner and I hope that \npretty soon we'll bring it up (inaudible) and if we can get some co-sponsors. If not, we'll have a vote on it I hope.\n\nLEAHY: I have no question that there's the disparity between crack and powder cocaine. It's unjustified.  I might be \nthinking of moving inside a different direction than where the senator from Alabama is.  I would note and Professor \nSutton noted this, should pick up \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The New York Times\" or even your local papers \nand you see article after article of how state after state facing real budgetary problems where it was easy to be \ntough on crime and just have mandatory minimums, suddenly have prisons they can't afford, a prison population \nthey cannot afford and I voted for some of these mandatory minimums and I think now in retrospect we hampered \nthe judges too much but perhaps the states too much and the -- when you get somebody that goes in there at a \n\n\n\nhigh school age and they get out 15 years later, and I'll go get gainfully employed.  You know that's not going to \nhappen.  And I think\u2026\n\nSESSIONS: At the time it did something about it and expressed concern, we've got good legislation I think that's\u2026\n\nLEAHY: I think what you do is raise the floor, more than lower the floor.\n\nSESSIONS: We have a concern that the powder cocaine yuppies are not getting enough sentence so they have a \nmodest increase in powder and a significant decrease in crack sentences as some equities that deal with the \ngirlfriend situation that Senator Durbin mentioned and all in all, it received very good reviews and quite consistently \nwhat the sentencing commission has asked us to do so if I think, Senator Hatch and I have stepped up to the plate.  \nPeople have been talking about it.  It's a problem.  Federal sentences as you mentioned, Mr. Roberts, are set by \nthis Congress and there's no need for the senators up here to blame you about Federal sentences.  We mandate \nthem and if they're not precisely correct, we ought to alter them and amend them and fix them and I think it's time to \nget moving on it.  And every year that goes by.\n\nLEAHY: I think we -- I definitely agree and I'll look at your legislation.\n\nSESSIONS: I think you'll like it.\n\nLEAHY: We should also look at some point and this is going to be something where it will work only if Democrats \nand Republicans work together, at some point we got to look at a basic overhaul.  We have Federalized far too \nmany crimes.  We ought to trust our local state police\u2026\n\nSESSIONS: ...Federalize violence against women.  You want to Federalize taking guns on state school grounds, \nprosecute our witnesses who (inaudible) legal briefs that question some of that.\n\nLEAHY: We Federalize, we Federalize carjacking.  We Federalize so many things we don't really need to.  We have \n-- actually you'd like the gun laws we have in Vermont.  Anybody unless you have a felony background can not \ncarry a loaded concealed weapon in Vermont with no permit required.  Very high incidence of gun ownership. \nAnybody, you don't need to register it or anything else.  You need no permit to own or carry a weapon, concealed or \notherwise.  We also have the lowest crime rate in the country.  Maybe it's because they figure that everybody's \narmed.\n\nHATCH: I think that has something to do with it.  Don't you just love this?  I mean this philosophical\u2026\n\nLEAHY: We also have, we also have and there's something else we have.  We have the lowest, the second lowest \ndeath rate from drunk drivers in Vermont.  The lowest is in Utah, but then they don't drink and\u2026\n\nHATCH: Once again, one of our quirks.\n\nLEAHY: I'll take some credit for that for having established the toughest drunk driving program in the state when I \nwas a prosecutor. OK, we filibustered long enough Schumer.  It's good for you to get back here.\n\nHATCH: We're happy to have\u2026\n\nLEAHY: We're glad to have you here at 8 o'clock just as you said.\n\nHATCH: We're happy to have Senator Schumer here.  Before I turn the microphone over to him, let me just put into \nthe record a letter from Russell G.  Redenbaugh (ph) who himself is blind and he's a member of the United States \nCommission on Civil Rights, re the nomination of Jeff Sutton.\n\nNow this is today's date.  Dear Senator Hatch, as a three-term member of the United States Civil Rights \nCommission and the commission's first and only representative of disabled Americans, I am writing to express my \nstrong support for the nomination of Judge Sutton to serve on the United States court of appeals for the sixth circuit.  \nI am familiar with Mr. Sutton's accomplishments and many of the landmark cases he has argued in the highest \n\n\n\ncourts.  I agree with some outcomes.  I disagree with others.  But it is clear to me that those of us who are disabled \nin America and those of us who seek to protect equal opportunity and equal access for all Americans, will be well \nserved by having in the Federal judiciary someone who is so intellectually active on the issues that concern \ndisabled Americans.\n\nI am also impressed by Jeff Sutton's personal background which shows heartfelt sympathy for ordinary people and \nthe disabled in particular.  The interests of the disabled are not easily pursued by partisan tactics and loud noise.  \nThe issues are complex.  We are not benefited by the mere continuation of past policies or the fighting of old \nbattles.  I am well satisfied that Jeff Sutton will make a fine judge and that he will bring to the job of judge the fine \nmind he has applied as an advocate and the compassionate heart that is so evidenced.  Sincerely, Russell G.  \nRedenbaugh.\n\nJust thought I'd put that in the record and we'll turn now to my dear friend and colleague from New York, Senator \nSchumer.\n\nSCHUMER: Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I very much appreciate all the committee being here for a long time and I \napologize for being later than the 8 o'clock that I expected to be here. Hopefully, we won't have to have meetings \nlike this on into the night in the future and that's a hope, a sincere hope that we can work together on those issues \nto prevent this from happening again.\n\nSESSIONS: With all due respect, if the Senator had been here this morning and had his questions, we would be \nin\u2026\n\n(UNKNOWN): That's not true.\n\nLEAHY: He was here this morning.\n\nSESSIONS: We've been here all day.\n\nHATCH: Enough is enough.  We're going to with Senator Schumer right now.  Senator Schumer.\n\nSCHUMER: You weren't here to hear my brilliant questioning this morning.\n\nSESSION: I heard one round.\n\nHATCH: Senator Schumer\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: And then you forgot.\n\nHATCH: Senator Schumer, Senator Schumer, the time is yours.\n\nSCHUMER: Thank you.  So one of the things, just more questioning of Professor Sutton, that I appreciate here is \nthat you haven't done what some of our witnesses have done in the case of hear no evil, see no evil, do no evil.  \nYou haven't said, you haven't shied away from being critical of all Supreme Court jurisprudence.  We've had other \nnominees who have refused to criticize any Supreme Court case ever.  I asked Mr. Estrada name a past case but \nhe kept saying, he kept saying well, he might come before them in the future.  He doesn't want to, so name a past \ncase he was critical of and he didn't want to even do that.  So you're not -- I think you've won some points from \nsome of my colleagues I've talked to by not being so sphinx-like.\n\nBut you did mention for instance, earlier in our dialogue, that you disagreed with the (inaudible) Joel (ph) case \nwhere you were critical of the Supreme Court's decision not to take cert.  Could you point to one other Supreme \nCourt case you're critical of?\n\nSUTTON: (inaudible) Joel just to be clear, I wasn't critical of the not to take cert, critical of the outcome in the case \nand specifically the decision not to allow handicapped individuals to obtain an education in a setting where they \ncould be with other members of their religious sect.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: How about another case you're critical of?\n\nSUTTON: Well, earlier in the day, it came up that there was a discussion about the ADA and specifically the \nquestion was raised by Senator Feinstein about whether, what my reaction was to the horrendous and egregious \nhistory of forced sterilization of those with mental disabilities.  And I made the point that there was a rather \nembarrassing U.S. Supreme Court case by the name of Buck (ph) remarkably written by Justice Holmes, \nremarkably, because he was otherwise a fairly distinguished jurist and I made the point that in the Garrett (ph) brief \nthat has received some criticism and I understand your perspective and other members of the committee's \nperspective on the position my client in that case.  But even in that particular case, where the Buck case remarkably \nstill on the books, of the state of Alabama agreed to take the position in the courts to say well, we don't think that's \ncorrectly decided. And you know, it's a sad, sad chapter.  Happily, it would be very difficult to overrule Buck now \nbecause every\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: (inaudible) You were representing Alabama.\n\nSUTTON: Exactly.  And all those laws are\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: (inaudible) could be a decided case did you disagree with, that you weren't representing anybody, that \nyou as a\u2026\n\nSUTTON: Well, I didn't represent anybody in Buck.  Buck's a 1927 decision.\n\nSCHUMER: I see.\n\nSUTTON: It's an infamous decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. It's been criticized in every quarter that's ever\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: And you represented Alabama later on when they challenged Buck or no?\n\nSUTTON: No, I'm making, I didn't do a good job explaining that. I was making the point that in the Garrett brief, \nwhich is the case about the ADA\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Oh, I see.\n\nSUTTON: We acknowledged this -- it's called the eugenics movement and that it was very unfortunate, sad chapter \nin American history.  Happily it's a closed chapter in American history and if it weren't closed the ADA would require \nit.\n\nSCHUMER: How about any others?\n\nSUTTON: I can't think of any others offhand.  I didn't come\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Koramatsu (ph)?\n\nSUTTON: Well, I mean anyone who's read Koramatsu would obviously be very uncomfortable with the results.  I've \nmade another point in the very brief I'm talking about.\n\nSCHUMER: I'm just trying to get an idea of your thinking when you're not representing a client and I don't want to \nget you into the issue of prospective cases so I'm just asking some cases that you disagreed with.  I mean I'm sure \nyou disagreed with Plessy v. Ferguson, right?\n\nSUTTON: Right.  The point I wanted to make though and it's actually the same point we made in the Garrett brief, \nthat you know, while it's easy today to look back on a case like Buck, look back on a case like Koramatsu and say \nboy, you know, how could that have happened?  Time has a way of making yesterday's progressive look like \ntoday's Neanderthal.  I mean there's just no doubt that that's true. The thing I'm a little reluctant to do is to second \nguess courts in saying boy, had I been the judge on that particular case back in that period of time, I would never \nhave fallen into that trap.  I think that's Monday morning quarterbacking and unfair.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: Well, that's a different issue. It's a different issue to say at the time I would have ruled differently than \ntimes have changed and things have changed and I would now disagree with that holding, right?\n\nSUTTON: That's true, although I must say, you know, unfortunately as a court of appeals judge, I can't imagine it \ncoming up with these particular cases.  But a court of appeals judge is obligated to follow U.S. Supreme Court \nprecedence for better or worse and that's -- and I of course would do that for better or worse.\n\nSCHUMER: But you would dis -- OK, any others you'd want to mention?\n\nSUTTON: No.\n\nSCHUMER: Is it that you can't think of any or you don't want to mention it? Well, I'm going to submit that question in \nwriting, OK. I'm going to ask you just so you can think about it for a while, of cases that you already decided \nSupreme Court cases that you might disagree with and I'll assume if you don't submit any, that you agree with \nevery one of them that's been decided already.\n\nSUTTON: That's a big task, but thank you for the opportunity to put it in writing.\n\nSCHUMER: Well, just give a few, that's all.  I'm not asking you to go through every Supreme Court case.  I am \nasking that we try to stop this sort of sphinx-like behavior we've had with witnesses who don't say anything about \nanything.  I'm not saying you've done that. You've done more than some.  I think that's a good question to ask.\n\nSUTTON: I understand.\n\nSCHUMER: (inaudible) getting their thinking.  OK, next question is, I want to talk a little bit about Sandoval (ph) \nbecause this one I think had really far reaching opinions, far reaching effect and I believe that you, more than most \nlawyers, have been quite successful in persuading the Supreme Court to adopt your ideas.  Five justices on the \ncourt have basically bought into the states' rights jurisprudence that you've been one of the leading advocates of \nand creators of really.  The ripple effect of that jurisprudence in my judgment has been very powerful.\n\nAnd perhaps the most striking example is Sandoval, where the court was dealing with Title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 which prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in Federally funded programs.  The \nSandoval decision reversed an understanding of law that had been in place for nearly three decades and it limited \nprivate citizens' power to enforce rights protected by Federal laws.\n\nThe ruling makes it nearly impossible to challenge a range of state practices with an unjustified disparate impact \nsuch as for instance, disproportionate toxic dumping in minority neighborhoods or the use of educationally \nunjustified testing of tracking procedures that harm minority students, the failure to apply appropriate language \nservices in health facilities.\n\nBut I believe your arguments in Sandoval went even further than the court went.  You argued that neither private \ncitizens, nor Federal, nor the Federal government has the power to enforce disparate impact regulations.  If the \ncourt had adopted your position in my judgment, it would have gutted the laws and regulations that protect millions \nof Americans.  You would rendered enforcement of these laws entirely effective.  That's why I said earlier this \nafternoon that you could do a thousand pro bono cases and it wouldn't undo the damage in my judgment that \nSandoval has done to individual rights and to the ability of this country to be as colorblind as we possibly can.\n\nSCHUMER: So I'm for one grateful that the court refused to go as far as you argued that they ought to go, but I \nworry about what would happen if you were wearing the judicial robes and had the power to make your ideas law, \ninto law, and I worry about frankly, what Professor Jeffrey Sutton's America would look like if you had the power \nconferred by a lifetime seat on the Federal bench.\n\nI worry that in that America, poor parents couldn't go to court to ensure that their children get basic medical care.  I \nworry that disabled children couldn't go before a judge and ask that she or he enforce the rights of equal \neducational opportunities.  I worry that in that America senior citizens wouldn't have the right to go to court and \nseek protection from employment discrimination.  Women would have no power to go to court to find gender \n\n\n\ndiscrimination.  I fear that in the America that you see from your reasoning and your jurisprudence, states have \nrights, but people really don't, because your argument in Sandoval went really far, again, way beyond what even \nmost would concede is a rather conservative court, conservative majority went with.\n\nSo I'd just like to know how you allay my concerns about that.  I mean the courts have been a place that individuals \nseek justice and I think one of the great things about our jurisprudence over 200 years is they've enabled more and \nmore individuals to seek that type of justice when it's either state governments or some other entity stopping them \nfrom gaining that justice.\n\nWe have a philosophy that seems to be governing here that government regulation is bad.  And if the government \nisn't going to protect people, then you at least want to see individuals be able to protect themselves through the \nrights that have been granted through our judicial process over centuries.  So how would you allay my concerns \nabout that, individuals particularly at a time when government is doing less to protect them, don't have the basic \nability as a result of your arguments if it were to become law, your arguments in Sandoval to seek justice, seek, well \nin this case, to seek freedom from discrimination?\n\nSUTTON: I know we would discuss this a little earlier and I appreciate your perspective on this and I think I'm \ngaining a greater appreciation as time goes on and I think it's obviously a very important perspective on this.  I \nwould like to say something.  I hope this doesn't irritate you, but I would like to point out that again this is not a case \nI've written about.  This was a case where I was an advocate and I really do feel strongly.  I mean maybe I'm \nmisguided in this, but do feel strongly that I had an obligation to make all reasonable arguments that I thought would \nadvance my client's cause. I don't think the Sandoval decision or brief in any way indicates what I would do as a \ncourt of appeals judge and\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Did your clients in that case urge you to take the argument that individuals, to take that extra step in \nthe argument that said individuals couldn't sue or did you suggest it to your clients? I mean where does the -- \nSandoval was a state case basically.  You went further.\n\nSUTTON: This may show that I'm not as sensitive as I should be, but I actually thought I was advocating the \nmoderate position.  Let me explain what I mean by that. You said that we challenged the validity of the regs in that \nwe said that the Federal government could not enforce the disparate impact regulations against states that it \nviolated the rights of individuals within that state.  There was a big debate about whether to challenge the regs.  \nWe could have challenged the regs.  As the opinion for the court indicates, we did not challenge the validity of the \nregs.\n\nI think the reason someone might say that we did, I mean the opinion of the court makes it quite clear.  They say \nthe validity of the regs is not in front of us because the state has not challenged it.  So even though we could have \nchallenged them, gone that extra step, we did not challenge them.  But you might say, OK, so what was -- why is \nthere anything in the brief at all about the regs?\n\nWell, the part of Sandoval that was difficult was the fact that Section 601, that's part of -- that's Title VI, Section 601 \nwas a provision that the U.S. Supreme Court in Bakke (ph), you remember the affirmative action case, where \nJustice Powell, Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall and I'm not sure about this, but I think it was also Justice \nBlackmun and Justice White, but I know it was Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall and Justice Powell, concluded \nthat Section 601 did not allow for claims for disparate impact but only for claims for intentional discrimination.\n\nYou might, as you're hearing me say that, well, that seems a little counterintuitive, why in the world were Justice \nMarshall and Justice Brennan saying 601 didn't reach disparate impact discrimination? It seems like an awfully \ngood idea and something in other cases they might have supported. Well, I don't know why they didn't do that \nobviously.  One can speculate and the speculation makes a little sense to me and that's that -- and this gets to the \nwhole complexity of disparate impact litigation.  An interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, Section 601, that allowed \nthat kind of disparate impact claim, could have doomed the Bakke affirmative action position that Justice Powell, \nJustice Brennan, Justice Marshall carved out, because of various obvious points that affirmative action could have \ndisparate impacts on other people based on race.  Who knows why they did that, but the fact of the matter is, those\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: I'm not following you.  What I was focusing on is that the brief went beyond what the Federal \ngovernment can do and talked about individual citizens rights to deal with disparate impact, not the disparate \nimpact itself, not the argument the regulations -- I don't know why\u2026\n\nSUTTON: If your question had said that we challenged the validity of the regulation and we didn't challenge the \nvalidity of the regulations and the Federal government can enforce them against individuals, in terms of the brief \narguing that private individuals could not sue for disparate impact under\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: You've just argued that they could not sue for disparate impact or did you argue that they couldn't sue \nfor a broader range of issues under Title VI?  I don't know the answer to it.  I'm just asking.\n\nSUTTON: Well, the only thing in the case was the regulations because under the -- this part of the brief I don't \nrecall, but I'd be surprised if we didn't concede this point, our client didn't concede this point, that the point was, \nthere's a case called Canon (ph) which deals with Title IX and Canon says that there is an implied right of action for \nclaims -- there is an implied right of action for claims for intentional discrimination.  So we would have conceded \nthat point.\n\nI think what you might be -- the reason you might be asking this question and I -- someone could disagree with this, \nis the notion that there's a case called Penhearst (ph) and a case called South Dakota v. Dole which say before \nspending clause legislation or other legislation is going to create cause of action against states, you need a clear \nstatement and that the argument in Sandoval, someone might have construed to mean even Canon wasn't rightly \ndecided.  And that's a pretty good objection.  That's of course exactly what the Supreme Court said.  That's exactly \nwhat the Federal government argued in opposition and it didn't prevail.\n\nSCHUMER: What you're saying here is in Sandoval, your arguments were simply related to the disparate impact \nregulations, not a general view that individuals didn't have the right to sue.\n\nSUTTON: No, yes, no, it was all -- the disparate impact regulations were all that were at issue.  I'm sorry if I didn't \nget to that more quickly.\n\nSCHUMER: Let me -- OK.  I just wanted to go back to City of Bernie (ph) again.  I don't even know where it is.  \nWhere is the city of Bernie?\n\nSUTTON: It's in Texas.\n\nSCHUMER: Texas.  What I asked you there is and we didn't get a clear answer.  Did you -- I just want to get an \nanswer, the underlying question, all right, which is, did you, the attorney general or the governor decide what \nposition to take in that case? I mean you were trying to think back, but maybe you've had a chance to think about it.\n\nSUTTON: Well, when you say position, the decision whether to file an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in the \nCity of Bernie?\n\nSCHUMER: And the arguments that were made.\n\nSUTTON: Well, I guess in the first part of it, clearly it's the attorney general in Ohio (inaudible) appointed position, \none reports to the attorney general.  The attorney general's an elected office holder in Ohio and very\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: So did they contact you and say we want to argue this case or did you contact them initially to file the \nbrief?\n\nSUTTON: Well, the point I was making was the attorney general or people in her corrections staff had already \ndecided to challenge\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: I didn't ask you that.  I asked you did they contact you initially?  Did they reach out to you or did you \ncall them up and say, hey, this would be a good idea and I want to help you with this?\n\n\n\nSUTTON: In terms of our involvement in the City of Bernie itself, I understand.  I think my recollection's correct.  I \nthink the state of Ohio filed an amicus brief on behalf of states, both at the cert stage, which is to say, encouraging \nthe court to take the case. I think the city had lost at the fifth circuit if my memory's correct and then filed a brief at \nthe merit stage.  So the important point would have been the cert stage because once you file an amicus brief for \nstates at the cert stage, generally you'll follow\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Your involvement didn't come in until the highest level, right?\n\nSUTTON: Exactly.\n\nSCHUMER: And I'm just asking you, I'm not asking you how Ohio came up with its position.  I'm asking did you -- \ninitially there had to be some hook up between Professor Sutton and the state of Ohio at this level.\n\nSUTTON: Right.\n\nSCHUMER: Did you contact them and say, I'd like to be involved in this, I'm an expert or did they contact you?\n\nSUTTON: I honestly don't remember.  If I were to guess what would have happened, because I\n\nSCHUMER: You remember or you don't remember.\n\nSUTTON: Well, I don't, but if I could take an educated guess, because I think it's mostly likely the case.  The \neducated guess is that what would have happened is, as I said before, the corrections lawyers were challenging \n(inaudible) the lower courts.  The corrections lawyers like all lawyers in the AG office work together on consumer \naffairs, environmental, they coordinate work and they tell each other what they're doing.  And my suspicion is that \nwhat happened is that the corrections officials in our office would have known about the City of Bernie litigation.  \nWhy, because they were challenging the same law in their cases and again, educated guess is they came to me \nsaying, Jeff, this is something we ought to try to get involved in.\n\nSCHUMER: How many of the cases were you argued on the significant cases I mentioned four or five before.  Are \nthere any where you reached out to the client and said, I'd like to make this argument? I'd like to get involved as \nopposed to them asking you?\n\nSUTTON: Right, well, the one that I know I reached out in, is the Dale Becker (ph) case and Dale Becker was the \nprisoner rights case where an inmate in Ohio filed a pro se cert petition.  The reason I know I reached out for that \none is because when the U.S. Supreme Court granted cert petition, when the U.S. Supreme Court granted a cert \npetition for a pro se inmate, for obvious reasons that inmate is not going to be able to argue the case in the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n\nSCHUMER: You have to give me the whole -- so in that one you reached out.\n\nSUTTON: I did.\n\nSCHUMER: I'm going to ask you to respond in writing.  Did you reach out and make the initial contact in Sand -- \nyou don't have to answer me now.  I'll do it in writing.  But I'd like in Sandoval, Garrett, Kimel (ph) and I asked about \nCity of Bernie already.\n\nSUTTON: OK.\n\nSCHUMER: Because in each of these cases your argument is you were just following what the client wanted.  Well, \nit would be a little different if you reached out to them and said hey, this is a good argument. Let's make it.  That \nwould be before representing the client.\n\nLet me give you one other follow up question.  I want to follow up here on something Senator Durbin asked.  You \nsaid you decided to take the Garrett because you wanted to argue before the Supreme Court. That was in \n\n\n\nreference to what Senator Durbin had asked you.  Is there any case you would refuse to take because the potential \nclient's desired outcome was too wrong or too offensive to you?\n\nSUTTON: Well, that's a difficult question.  I mean I would say the Garrett case.  I want to make sure I'm correct on \nthat.  I mean I was trying to develop a U.S. Supreme Court practice and it's obviously an honor to be asked to argue \na case in the U.S. Supreme Court and it's just an easy opportunity to accept and that's certainly what I did.  And I \nwas happy to be litigating there.\n\nHATCH: Will the Senator yield on that?  I have a letter from Bill Pryor (ph) attorney general of the state of Alabama.  \nDear Chairman Hatch.  I'm writing the correct the record concerning Jeffrey Sutton, a nominee to the court of \nappeals for the sixth circuit.  I understand that it has been reported that Mr. Sutton aggressively pursued the \nopportunity to work on Garrett v. Alabama, a case in which the state of Alabama defended itself against a lawsuit \nbrought under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nI am the person who hired Mr. Sutton to represent Alabama before the Supreme Court of the United States and I \ndid so solely on the basis that I hold his legal abilities in the highest esteem.  Mr. Sutton never solicited this \nrepresentation.  I sought his representation for the state of Alabama.  I hope this clears up any confusion in this \nmatter.  I thought that would be something that would help here at this point for both Senator Schumer and you.\n\nSCHUMER: Did somebody reach out to him since Senator Durbin asked the question?\n\nHATCH: Excuse me.  I'm not sure what you're saying.  He said that\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: No, that letter is pretty timely in terms of Senator Durbin's question.  Did we get that letter this \nafternoon?\n\nHATCH: No, it's dated January 23rd.\n\nSCHUMER: Thanks.  Mr. Chairman, I have some more questions for Mr. Sutton.  The hour is late.  I'm going to \nsubmit them in writing\u2026\n\nHATCH: Appreciate it.\n\nSCHUMER: \u2026 because I won't have any other chance to question either Judge Cook or Judge, Mr. Roberts.  I'd \nlike to ask each of them one question tonight.\n\nHATCH: Sure.  Now we've reserved this time for you and we're grateful that you came back to do this.\n\nSCHUMER: Well, thank you.  I'll do it again if you'd like me to be more grateful to you.\n\nHATCH: I think once is enough.  You're just so accommodating.\n\nUNKNOWN: There's only so much gratitude to go around.\n\nSCHUMER: OK, this is for Mr. Roberts and I'm sure sorry, it's a long day for you and I'm sorry that you've had to sit \nhere through all of this.  I know Senator Hatch has argued we're inconveniencing you and I apologize for that.  I do \nthink -- I mean I've made my point clear, that I wish we had had better time, more time, not at 9 o'clock to question \nyou and I don't think asking people to come back for such an important appointment is anything undue. Judges ask \nyou to come back and argue cases all the time and that's less significant than this and every lawyer has sat around \nand waited in the court for the calendar to clear.\n\nSo, but here we are and I've made my argument and not succeeded so let's -- let me ask each of these questions, \none question to each of you.  You've come very highly recommended.  You're obviously one of the great legal \nminds in a city full of great legal minds and for me, with your situation, just as with Professor Sutton, excellence is \nnot the issue.  But I do want to ask you something about these state rights issues we've been discussing all day.  \n\n\n\nAnd as with Professor Sutton, I'm not going to ask you questions based on briefs you wrote for your clients.  I want \nto ask you about some of the things you've said in your personal capacity.\n\nI want to read to you an excerpt from an interview you did with Nina Totenberg, I guess well known to this \ncommittee before I got on it, discussing several states' rights cases from the 1999 Supreme Court term.  I think we \nhave a fair excerpt from that interview but I'll give you a full chance to explain your thoughts if it's out of context at \nall.  But here is what was said.\n\nQuote, Mr. Roberts, well, I think the three decisions taken as a group are a big deal.  You'll probably (inaudible) \nyou know it better than I do, that's for sure.  It's a healthy reminder that we're a country that was formed by states \nand that we still live under a Federal system.  It's the United States of America and what these cases say is just \nbecause Congress has the power to tell individuals and companies that this is what you're going to do and if you \ndon't do it, people can sue you, that doesn't mean they can treat the states the same way.  But the states, as co-\nequal sovereigns, have their own sovereign powers and that includes, as everyone at the time of the constitutional \nconvention understood sovereign immunity.\n\nYou went on to say regarding the Congress' exercise of the spending clause power, well, quote, these are all \nquotes, well, so much of what we, what our restrictions are based on, the spending power.  You know, even for \nprivate citizens, if you accept Federal money, you're covered by Title IX and Title VI and the basic principle is, if you \npay the piper, you get to call the tune. And I think the Federal government could say, if we're giving you money and \nit's related to the area in which we're trying to get you to waive sovereign immunity, we can require you to consent \nto suit as a condition of getting those funds.\n\nThe example you gave is a good one.  This is you still speaking. If they get Federal funds for your probation \ndepartment, they can say, we're not going to give you those unless you waive sovereign immunity. And that's quite \ncommon.  The Federal government for example has sovereign immunity as well.  It has waived it.  Then Nina \nTotenberg says and supposing the Federal government said, if you accept any Federal money, states, you have to \nabide by the Federal provisions that we enact for everybody.\n\nMr. Roberts, I think that would go too far.  The jargon is that the waiver has to be germane to what funds, to what \nthe funds are for. You may remember a while back the Federal government said, if we give you highway funds, \nyou've got to raise your drinking age to 21, because we think that, we think having these teenagers, teenage \ndrinkers causes accidents.  The court held that that was germane to that purpose, but there has to be a connection.  \nIt can't just be if you take a penny of Federal funds, you've got to waive your sovereign immunity across the board.  \nIt's the end of the quote.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out here is where all of this appears in the constitution.  For the life of me, I can't figure it \nout.  I keep going back to this document and looking for the words like sovereign immunity and congruent and \nproportional and germane to the purpose and I don't see any of it.  We keep hearing that the justices who are \nadvocating these things are strict constructionists, but as far as I can tell, they mostly strictly construe the law in \nfavor of states and big businesses against the interests of average people.\n\nCan you help me understand this?  It appears from this interview you agree with the court's jurisprudence in this \narea, the court's majority, the majority of recent jurisprudence here.  Do you and if so, why when the plain language \nof the constitution is either silent or to the contrary?\n\nROBERTS: If I'm remembering the radio show, I think it was sort of a wrap up of the Supreme Court's term and I \nthink she may have had other people on as well.  They're talking about what's significant and I thought that the \nSupreme Court's immunity cases involving the states were indeed significant. That was I think the question before \nyou got to the part you were quoting, is this a big deal?  And I thought it was and I said that and then part of the \nrejoinder was, well, can't we use the spending power to get around this?  In other words if we're serious about it, \nlet's use the spending power.\n\n\n\nAnd what I was articulating there was what I understood the stage of the law to be, which is, as a general matter, \nthe answer is yes. South Dakota v. Dole, the highway funds case.  But again, I'm stating what I understood the law \nto be that there is this so called germaneness requirement.  That's what the Supreme Court's\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Where did it come from?  Where in the constitution did it come from?  Let us say the Federal \ngovernment made a more sweeping law and said, if you accept any Federal money, not just highway money, you \nhave to have a 21-year old drinking age.  Now that may be very broad power of the Federal government, but I'd like \nto know where in the constitution I solicit or derive, it says that the Federal government can't do that.\n\nROBERTS: I don't know what the Supreme Court precedence hold. My familiarity with the requirement really was \nwith the South Dakota case where they articulated it and they explained over for example, over the dissent of \nJustice Brennan and Justice O'Connor, that this requirement was met.  I haven't gone back and read the trial case.  \nI don't know the answer, what the analysis was.  I was just articulating what I understood the law to be for the \npurposes of the interview.\n\nSCHUMER: But do you have any further thoughts on -- to me it's an important question.  You know the laws much \nbetter than I do, but it would seem to me when you're making such a -- you're making a dramatic change.  We've \nhad basically relates to expanded Federal government power versus reducing Federal government power and \nthat's been the trend in this court and there's got to be a basis for it.\n\nROBERTS: Well, Senator, I was listening as you were (inaudible) with some trepidation when someone says, this is \nwhat you said. You're waiting for -- not only the nongrammatical part but the part that sounds ludicrous and I have \nto say\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: ...when I'm used to nongrammatical parts.\n\nROBERTS: I have to say, I didn't hear anything I would say, gosh, you know, I wish I hadn't said that.  I think it is \nthe case that we do have a Federal system that states have powers and responsibilities and the Federal \ngovernment does as well.  Certainly under the supremacy clause the legislation that you enact is the supreme law \nof the land, consistent with the constitution.\n\nI appreciate the concern about the sovereign immunity cases. You're quite right.  There is no sovereign immunity \nclause in the constitution.  On the other hand, the court's cases have been fairly consistent that the Federal \ngovernment enjoys sovereign immunity. This body has done much over the years to waive that, Federal tort claims \nact, a variety of things.  But that basic recognition of Federal sovereign immunity has always held firm.  And I think it \nis hard for to explain to state government, why do they have it and we don't.  And if we had it at the time of the \nfounding, when did we give it up? And the Supreme Court has given some answers.  Well, part of it you gave up in \nthe 14th amendment in Section 5.  But I do appreciate that it is a difficult area, because you're not dealing with the \ntextual provision in the constitution.\n\nSCHUMER: Any other, either of the other two witnesses want to comment on that? Not on Mr. Robert grammar, but \nrather just on the general question I asked.  Where (inaudible)\n\nSUTTON? : I don't know why I'm reengaging.\n\nSCHUMER: I don't know why either.\n\nSUTTON: I'm a fool.  But the one point I just wanted to make. There's no spending clause either for what it's worth.  \nThis comes from Article I, Section 8 and it says Congress can provide for the general welfare and the court \nsensibly, atexturally (ph) but sensibly has said, hey, if it's Congress' money, they can tell the states how they want it \nspent and if they want to attach conditions, they can. So\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Well, where does this one come from?\n\nSUTTON: That's my point. There isn't a spending clause.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER: (inaudible) but you said it sprung from the clause to protect for the general welfare, right?\n\nSUTTON: Exactly. No, I'm just saying there isn't a spending clause so there's not a textual basis for it, just making \nthe point that the Supreme Court decision sensibly has said, if Congress raises money to provide for the general \nwelfare, they can attach conditions to how it's spent.\n\nSCHUMER: Only certain conditions.\n\nSUTTON: Well, that's what South Dakota\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Jeffrey Roberts was talking about in his interview.  He was saying there has to be garmaneness. There \nhas to be proportionality.\n\nSUTTON: I don't think he was saying proportionality.  I think germaneness.\n\nSCHUMER: He didn't say proportionality.  I stand corrected.  He was saying, let me try to correct the grammar here, \nalthough I don't know where you would make such egregious mistakes.  But anyway\u2026\n\nUNKNOWN: I would just note for the record that Professor Sutton did not serve in the military.  Otherwise he'd no \nbetter than to volunteer at this point.\n\nSUTTON: I deserve that.\n\nSCHUMER: It was brave.  Do you have anything you'd like to say, Judge Cook on this?\n\nCOOK: I don't.\n\nSCHUMER: Just let me say that I was trying to be Dean Martin to your Jerry Lewis on that one.  Let me ask you a \nquestion.  OK.\n\nSESSIONS: Senator Schumer on that subject, Blackstone Commentaries says that no suit or action can be brought \nagainst the king even in civil matters because no court can have jurisdiction over him.  Then it goes on, for the \nsame reason, no action lies under a republican form of government against the state or nation unless the legislature \nhave authorized it, a principle recognized in the jurisprudence of the United States and of individual states.  So that \nwas the classic\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Sovereign immunity.\n\nSESSION: Attorney general.  I mean I've relied on every attorney general who relies on it.  It's not explicitly stated in \nthe constitution directly but there is a sense in which if the state can be sued or the Federal government can be \nsued, it can be destroyed. So you have to\n\nSCHUMER: I understand but that's where we pass from strict constructionism to judicial activism in a certain way \nand\u2026\n\nSESSION: I don't think the constitution ever covered everything and this was existing principle at the time.\n\nSCHUMER: Look, I've made that argument for a long time as you know. Let me go to Justice Cook.\n\nHATCH: One last question\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Justice Cook, it's a very long one (inaudible) OK, Justice Cook, it's my understanding that you \npreviously discussed a decision in Davis v. Wal-Mart with Senator Kennedy.  I'd like to return to the case.  I'm \ntroubled by your dissent.  In that case, a widow, whose husband had been killed on the job, settled a lawsuit against \nthe employer.  She then attempted to file a second lawsuit after learning that the employer had instructed \nemployees to lie about how her husband had been killed.  The employer apparently did this in order to wrangle a \nsettlement out of her.  Your colleagues found that this evidence was not only enough to permit the suit to go \n\n\n\nforward, but that it actually might support punitive damages.  Punitive damages are usually reserved for cases \nwhere the wrong doing is blatant.  It seems kind of blatant here.\n\nIt's my understanding that you explained to Senator Kennedy that your dissent in this case was based on your view \nthat (inaudible) prevented the widow from filing the suit.  Is that correct?\n\nCOOK: Only because she had previously litigated this matter. She filed a negligence -- yes, so she had a \nnegligence action that was concluded.\n\nSCHUMER: Right.\n\nCOOK: And that this claim was sufficiently related and could have been brought\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: So you're relying on (inaudible)\n\nCOOK: That's right.\n\nSCHUMER: Once an issue is decided, it's final and to reach the conclusion that the widow couldn't refile her suit, \nonce, even after she learned after the company's quite horrible deception. Another fundamental principle however \nof our legal system is that juries find facts based on the evidence presented.  And judges and appellate courts give \na great deal of deference to those jury determinations, it's my understanding, that to overturn a jury verdict an \nappellate court must find that the jury's decision was quote, against the manifest weight of the evidence.  And that's \nas we all know, rather high standard.\n\nIn Burns v. LCI Communications, a jury found that employees had suffered age discrimination and the evidence at \ntrial included statements by the employer that quote, wanted to bring in young, aggressive staff members and \nchange out the old folks, unquote and that he did not want, that he did not, quote, want old marathoners in my sales \norganization.  I want young sprinters.  This man was not in charge of the Senate.\n\nDespite this evidence which was enough to convince a jury of age discrimination, you voted to overturn the jury's \nverdict for the employees.  It appears that you substituted your views for those of the jury who actually heard the \ntestimony and saw the evidence of discrimination.  I find it troubling that legal principles constrained you in this case \nwhere you're vindicating an employer.  How do you explain the deference to legal principles in the one case, Davis \nv. Wal-Mart, you denied the widow's right to her day in court, but you're willingness to disregard other important \nlegal principles when a jury has found evidence of discrimination?\n\nCOOK: In the\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: You can just pull the mike a little closer.\n\nCOOK: I'm sorry.  In the Burns case that you -- the verdict was overturned by the court of appeals unanimously and \nthen five of the seven members of the Ohio supreme court agreed that the plaintiff had not shown that she had \nbeen discriminated against.  So we were -- they agreed that there was a disagreement among us but at least all five \nmembers agreed that she had not shown discrimination and the facts you're mentioning, the sprinters, etcetera.  I \nhave not a great recollection of it, but I think the point was that those comments were made years before so the \neffort, the plaintiff's effort which garnered a verdict did not use evidence of, that was not related to her and so I \nmean a good majority of the supreme court agreed that actually discrimination had not been shown even though \nwhen you cite it, it all sounds pretty awful.  But the three judges of the court of appeals and five of the supreme \ncourt agreed.\n\nSCHUMER: In Burns?\n\nCOOK: Yes.\n\nSCHUMER: OK, just explain the first case, your ruling in\u2026\n\n\n\nCOOK: Wal-Mart?\n\nSCHUMER: Wal-Mart, yes.\n\nCOOK: I'm getting tired.  In Wal-Mart I think we just talked about it was a (inaudible) was the basis for my dissent \nand that's a dissent in Wal-Mart.  And it was the second matter after the negligence claim, the widow had the \ninformation.  She said that she then learned later that the employer\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: Say that again, it was after the second, she didn't get the information until\u2026\n\nCOOK: She didn't -- no, the record actually showed that she had that information but and then didn't bring it.  I \nmean had it within time to bring it as part of the original negligence claim and failed to do so.\n\nSCHUMER: I see.\n\nCOOK: And so we determined that it was waived.\n\nSCHUMER: (inaudible) Don't remember, OK.  Well, I don't quite -- you know it better than me again but I think the \nsecond case, the Burns case, at least from what my cursory knowledge is a little different.  So I'm going to just ask \nMr. Chairman in the interest of time, that I be -- submit some questions about these two issues and maybe some \nothers to Judge Cook in writing.\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you Senator.  I would senators to submit as many questions as they -- submit their questions \nnow.  We won't have the transcript by tomorrow at 4 and any additional questions, have them submitted by 5 \no'clock on Tuesday and then I would like your answers back by Wednesday evening because I intend to put you on \nthe markup for the Thursday from tomorrow.\n\nSCHUMER: Chairman, we have a -- I mean I have a bunch\u2026\n\nHATCH: We've already agreed on this.\n\nSCHUMER: A week to\u2026\n\nHATCH: Well, it amounts to a week, really.  I mean we're -- and nobody's going to press you on this.  If we have to \nput them over a week we will do so.  But that's what we're going to do and I just have to say, you've been very \npatient today and this has been a tough day for you.  I apologize that it's taken so long.  You've been here really for \n12 hours.  And really the equivalent of two days and you've been patient with us and we appreciate it and hopefully \nwe can move ahead with your nominations and do so in an expeditious, yet fair to all sides fashion.\n\nAnd I just caution you, when you get these questions, answer them as quickly as you can, but I'm hopeful that you'll \nhave all these questions answered by next Wednesday.  Now Senator Leahy.\n\nLEAHY: First I want to reiterate I appreciate your moving down here to accommodate, especially the disabled \npeople earlier and I appreciate you accepting our recommendation for that.  I also not that you've been very fair with \nthe clock on giving senators on both sides whatever about time (ph) they needed.  I would hope -- I understand the \npressures the chairman was under from his side of the aisle on this but I would hope that this would not be \nnecessary to have -- I don't mind having hearings every day if you want.  But not to have three nominees where \nthere will be extensive questions on like this at the same time.\n\nAgain, we show what happened to the three district court judges. There were not extensive questions.  We passed \nthat in 45 minutes or so.  Again I appreciate having been there.  I appreciate the pressures the chairman was under \nunder this, but I would hope that those pressures would lessen as the year goes on and we might work out \nsomething because I think it is important when all senators were going to have to vote initially in the committee and \nactually have the time to be here to hear the candidates.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, thank you Senator and we'll certainly take that into heavy consideration.  In fact I already have.  Next \nweek's hearing will involve only one circuit court of appeals nominee and I don't know how many district court. We'll \ndecide that, I think three or four district court nominees.  And I just want to thank everybody for their cooperation, \nthe distinguished senator from New York.  I know he's been upset at me but I care a great deal for him and he's one \nof the astute people, one of the most astute people on this panel and I just appreciate his forbearance with me.\n\nSCHUMER: I'm not upset at you.  I mean I'm just upset at the situation.\n\nHATCH: I understand and we're going to\u2026\n\nSCHUMER: ...justice to the importance of what we're doing here.\n\nHATCH: Well, I appreciate that.  With that I just want to compliment each of you.  I don't know when we've had a \npanel that has been as articulate on some of these constitutional issues as the three of you have been.\n\nMr. Sutton, you've born the brunt of most of the questions today. I know that you're probably worn out, but you've \ndone a terrific job in my opinion and deserve a lot of credit for your astuteness.  I think everybody here \nacknowledges you're a fine lawyer if not one of the best in the whole country.\n\nAnd Mr. Roberts, no question about your abilities.  I think everybody here has basically acknowledged that today as \none of the great appellate advocates in our country, both of you are, among the greatest appellate advocates we \nhave in this country.\n\nAnd Justice Cook, it's very apparent that you're a very good person, that you understand what the role of a judge \nreally is and we expect you to abide by that understanding as you serve on the court, on the Federal court. So with \nthat, we'll recess until further notice and thank you all for being here and I'll move as fast as I can on this \nnominations.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nEND\n\nNotes\n\n[????] - Indicates Speaker Unknown\n\n   [--] - Indicates could not make out what was being said.[off mike] - Indicates could not make out what was being \nsaid.\n"}
