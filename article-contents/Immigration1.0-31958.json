{"title": "ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DID LAWN CARE FOR MITT ROMNEY", "body": "\n\"I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life.\"\n\nMitt Romney on Tuesday, October 18th, 2011 in a Republican presidential primary debate\n\n* * *\n\nTHE RULING: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nMitt Romney's hiring decisions in lawn care continue to dog him.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor, in an Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate, faced accusations from \nprimary foe Rick Perry that he hired illegal immigrants to work at his home.\n\nThe two had this tense exchange:\n\nPerry: \"Mitt, you lose all of your standing, from my perspective, because you hired illegals in your home and you \nknew about it for a year. And the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on \nimmigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy.\"\n\nModerator Anderson Cooper: \"Gov. Romney?\"\n\nRomney: \"Rick, I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life. And so I'm afraid -- I'm looking forward to finding \nyour facts on that, because that just doesn't --\"\n\nThen they proceeded to talk over each other, but Romney's claim was virtually the same as one we've checked \nbefore.\n\nThe first time Romney was running for president, in 2006, the Boston Globe broke a story about his hired help.\n\nThe Globe said Romney, for an entire decade, used a landscaping company that relied on illegal Guatemalan \nimmigrants. Employees at the company, Community Lawn Service with a Heart, said its owner hadn't asked them \nto provide documents showing their immigration status.\n\nThe workers said they were paid $9 to $10 an hour, in cash, for working sometimes 11 hours a day.\n\n\nThe newspaper sent a team of reporters to Guatemala after getting a tip that Romney had hired a landscaping \ncompany notorious for using illegal immigrants. They tracked down three former landscapers who claimed to have \nbeen in the United States illegally when they worked on Romney's lawn.\n\nOne of them, Rene Alvarez Rosales, said he worked for Romney eight years landscaping his lawn, occasionally \ngetting a \"buenos dias\" from Romney himself. Others told the Globe of casual encounters with Romney over the \nyears, during which he had never inquired about their status.\n\nRomney's first response to reporters' questions about the matter: \"Aw, geez.\"\n\nLater, his campaign issued a statement that the governor knew nothing about the immigration status of the \nlandscaping workers, and that his dealings were with owner of the company, a legal immigrant from Colombia. The \nowner told the Globe that Romney never asked him about the status of the workers.\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Times followed up with another story, a Romney spokesman said, \"Gov. Romney has no \ninformation or knowledge to corroborate the Globe's allegations. He hired a legitimate lawn service company and \nhe knows the owner as a decent, hardworking person who is a legal resident.\"\n\nWhen Romney said he \"did not\" have illegal immigrants working for him, we rated his statement Mostly False, \ngiven the credible evidence that undocumented lawn care laborers from Guatemala worked at his home for years, \nand his careful statements about his knowledge of their status.\n\nIn this case, his wording is slightly different, that he had not \"ever hired an illegal in my life.\" It's clear from the \nGlobe's reporting that he hired a landscaping company and that employed illegal immigrants. He has made the \nargument he hired the company, not the specific workers. Still, they were doing hired work on his property. We find \nhis claim Mostly False.\n\n* * *\n\nAbout this statement:\n\nPublished: Tuesday, October 18th, 2011 at 11:51 p.m.\n\nSubjects: Immigration\n\nSources: Transcript of Oct. 18, 2011 Republican presidential debate; PolitiFact, Hired help haunts Romney, Nov. \n28, 2007; \"Illegal immigrants toiled for governor,\" Boston Globe, Dec. 1, 2006; \"Workers a thorny issue for \nRomney,\" Los Angeles Times, Dec. 2, 2006\n\nResearched by: Angie Drobnic Holan, Molly Moorhead\n\nEdited by: Bill Adair\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO (2)\n"}
