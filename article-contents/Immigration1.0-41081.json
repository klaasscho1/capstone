{"title": "Irish Immigrants In Saugatuck", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nIt was pleasant to read about the Saugatuck section of Westport, Conn., where I reside (\"An Immigrant Haven, a \nSailor's Delight,\" Oct. 2), but no mention was made of the first wave of European immigrants. The first tracks for \nthe opening of the New Haven Railroad were built by Irish immigrants in 1849. A combination of centuries of \noppression and disastrous famine drove nearly a million Irish to a new life of freedom in America. Many of these \nearly Irish settled in and near the Saugatuck railroad station and it was soon known as \"Little Dublin.\" The street I \nlive on, Treadwell Avenue, was known locally as \"Irish Boulevard\" as late as the 1930's.\n\n \n\nKENNETH H.
