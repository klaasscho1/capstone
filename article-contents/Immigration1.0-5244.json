{"title": "METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW JERSEY;4 Accused of Smuggling Immigrants From India", "body": "\nAn immigrant smuggling ring enrolled its clients in intensive music and dance lessons so they could get visas as \nmembers of folk groups from India and then stay in the United States after the groups left, Federal officials said \nyesterday.\n\nIn at least four cases from 1994 to 1997, Indians paid up to $20,000 each to be smuggled into the United States as \nmembers of legitimate groups that performed at schools and cultural festivals, said Holly Kulka, an assistant United \nStates attorney.\n\nThe smuggled immigrants did not actually perform, but the lessons helped them pass random interviews by \nUnited States Embassy officials in Bombay who issued them visas, Ms. Kulka said.\n\nOfficials said members of the ring also ran an unlicensed business that bought gold in the United States and sold it \nat a profit in India, skirting that country's limits on gold imports.\n\nFederal indictments were unsealed yesterday against Ajay and Ramanik Patel, a father and son in Colonia; \nKanubhai Patel of Belleville and Hasmukh Patel, who is believed to be in India, where he coordinated operations, \nMs. Kulka said.\n\nAll but Hasmukh Patel were arrested yesterday, Ms. Kulka said. She said Kanubhai Patel, the only one not indicted \non charges related to the gold business, was freed after posting $100,000 bail yesterday in Federal District Court in \nNewark.\n\nKanubhai Patel's lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, said his client was \"completely innocent.\"\n"}
