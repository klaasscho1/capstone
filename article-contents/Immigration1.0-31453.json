{"title": "FUNERAL FOR HAITIAN IMMIGRANT IS MONDAY", "body": "\nThe funeral service for Nikenson Cenatus, the 19-year-old Haitian man who drowned last weekend at Fort De Soto \nPark, will take place Monday at St. Paul's Catholic Church.\n\nCenatus had come to the United States two years ago for surgery through Partners With Haiti, a ministry of the \nchurch. He remained after the earthquake ravaged Haiti, learned English, got a job and was preparing to take his \nGED. The youngest of five children, he helped to support his mother and siblings in Haiti with his earnings from a \nSweetbay supermarket.\n\nPartners With Haiti has sought the help of U. S. Rep. Kathy Castor to get an emergency non-immigrant visa for \nCenatus' mother, Diuedonne Lindor, to travel from her home on the remote Haitian island of La Gonave for the \nfuneral. Dr. Mark Morris, a member of the Partners With Haiti group, said Lindor has an appointment with the \nembassy at 7 a.m. today .\n\nMonday's service at St. Paul's, 1800 12th St. N, will begin at 11 a.m. A viewing will be held earlier, starting at 10 \na.m. A reception will take place in St. Paul's school cafeteria after the service.\n\nMorris said Cenatus' body will be cremated and his ashes taken home for a service at the family's Wesleyan \nchurch.\n\nCenatus had been on an outing with a group from Sanctification Haitian Baptist Church, when he waded into the \nwater Saturday afternoon. He could not swim. An autopsy by the Pinellas County Medical Examiner determined the \ncause of death was drowning.\n\nWaveney Ann Moore can be reached at wmoore@sptimes.com or (727) 892-2283.\n\n* * *\n\nFast facts\n\nTo help\n\n\nDonations to Nikenson Cenatus' family may be made to To Partners With Haiti, St. Paul's Catholic Church, 1800 \n12th St. N, St. Petersburg, FL 33704, or online partnerswithhaiti.com.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO - DIRK SHADD - Times\n"}
