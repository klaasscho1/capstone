{"title": "IMMIGRANTS WANT MAYOR TO COOL ICE'S HEAT", "body": "\nIMMIGRANT ADVOCATES yesterday demanded Mayor Bloomberg take a stand on a new program that forces \ncops to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement the fingerprints of anyone arrested.\n\n\"We hope that he would take a stand on this. It's supposed to be a sanctuary city,\" said Angela Fernandez, \nexecutive director of the Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights.\n\nBloomberg was noncommittal, though, saying there are times when city authorities must ask about immigration \nstatus.\n\n\"If there is a public safety reason to do it, if you get arrested,\" Bloomberg said.\n\nICE officials say the program, called Secure Communities, will flag and remove dangerous criminals who are here \nillegally.\n\nOpponents say it will make immigrants afraid to go to police and could result in the deportation of domestic \nviolence victims who are sometimes booked by cops after a dispute.\n\nSecure Communities is being rolled out amid confusion about whether cities can opt out.\n\nWhen the state signed on this spring, ICE assured officials that each county could decide if it would take part in the \ninformation exchange, according to a Division of Criminal Justice Services spokesman.\n\nHomeland Security officials now say counties can't opt out completely; they can only delay implementing the \nprogram.\n\nAdvocates who want Gov. Paterson to cancel the state's agreement with ICE rallied in front of his office yesterday. \nThey also sued the feds - and a judge has ordered ICE to turn over documents that would clarify whether cities or \ncounties can opt out.\n"}
