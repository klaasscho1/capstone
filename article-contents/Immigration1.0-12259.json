{"title": "For unskilled workers, getting a visa is hard", "body": "\nWhy don't illegal immigrants play by the rules and come here legally to work in places like poultry plants and carpet \nmills?\n\nMost of them can't.\nAJC\n\nThe federal government gives visas that let foreign nationals come to the United States for a specific job, but it has \nno visa category that would cover the thousands of illegal immigrants in low-wage jobs around Georgia.\n\n\"The people don't have papers because there are no papers for these kinds of jobs,\" said Remedios Gomez Arnau, \nconsul general of Mexico in Georgia and neighboring states.\n\nPresident Bush and other politicians were pushing last year to let U.S. companies legally import immigrant \nworkers, but momentum fizzled after Sept. 11.\n\nThe government has visas for unskilled agricultural workers, called H-2A visas. Several Georgia farmers get \nthem to bring in Latino immigrants to help harvest the Vidalia onion and other crops.\n\nAnother kind of visas for unskilled workers, called an H-2B visa, often is used for jobs in forestry. It's unsuitable \nfor jobs in the construction, landscaping, poultry and carpet industries, which attract thousands of illegal immigrants, \nGomez said, because the visas are temporary and hard to get.\n\nEstimates of the illegal immigrant population in Georgia vary. Some immigrant advocates put the number around \n250,000.\n\nFederal law says U.S. companies can't knowingly hire illegal immigrants and that illegal immigrants can't legally \nwork, but Gomez said the reality is quite different. The Immigration and Naturalization Service rarely fines \nbusinesses for employing illegal immigrants, and academics say economies all over the Southeast have come to \nrely on the labor of illegal immigrants.\n\nGraphic\n\n\n \n\nPhoto: Remedios Gomez Arnau, consul general of Mexico\n"}
