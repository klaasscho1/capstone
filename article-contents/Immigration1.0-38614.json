{"title": "Palestinians From Kuwait Allowed to Stay in U.S.;4-Year Permit Eases Fears of Deportation", "body": "\nPresident Bush has ended rising fears of imminent deportation for hundreds of Palestinian families airlifted to the \nUnited States from Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War. He issued an order that allows them to remain and work \nin the United States for four years.\n\nThe order, issued late Thursday to the Justice Department, resolved an unusual immigration problem facing many \nof the 2,000 former Kuwait residents brought here after Iraq invaded Kuwait.\n\nThe State Department, anxious to get all U.S. citizens out of Kuwait, bent the rules and allowed entire families to \ncome here if one person, most often a child, was a U.S. citizen.\n\nBut the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) told the new arrivals that it did not have the authority to allow \nthem to stay. Under the law, Americans under age 21, although citizens because they were born here, cannot ask \nthat their foreign-born parents be admitted.\n\nThe INS allowed the emigres to stay here and gave them temporary work authorization until the end of this year. \nThe INS said they would then face deportation.\n\nBut the vast majority of the non-citizens coming on the \"freedom flights\" from Kuwait were Palestinians whose \nU.S.-citizen children were born here when the parents were attending universities. They had no home country to \nreturn to, and Kuwaiti officials said they would not be allowed to return to Kuwait.\n\nThe emigres, many of them business people, engineers and other professionals, scattered after arriving here, with \na large number going to California and about 60 families settling in North Carolina. In interviews last month, several \nof those in Raleigh, N.C., expressed growing anxiety as the Dec. 31 deadline approached.\n\nMany of them said their tenuous immigration status here, with work permits issued on a six-month basis, made it \ndifficult to get decent jobs. A representative of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which coordinated \nthe lobbying effort to allow the Palestinians to stay, said the four-year residency period would be enough for the \nPalestinians to resolve their immigration status.\n\nThe committee's president, Albert Mokhiber, yesterday hailed Bush's decision and said he was \"confident the \nevacuated families, which consist in large part of skilled professionals, will make contributions to the United States \nat least as significant as the contributions they made to Kuwait.\"\n\n\nSen. Terry Sanford (D-N.C.) and 20 other senators had written Bush Thursday urging him to grant a four-year \nextension to the Palestinians. Sanford, in a prepared statement, said yesterday he was \"very pleased\" with Bush's \nresponse. \"There was no good reason to force families we invited here in the first place to return to uncertain or \neven dangerous conditions -- quite possibly making them choose to leave their American-born children behind,\" \nSanford said.\n"}
