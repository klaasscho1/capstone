He said a sixth person was taken by medical helicopter to a burn center in Dallas. \n\n Spence said it is believed the group was sleeping in the field when the fire was set. He said wind may have caused \nthe fire to burn faster than normal. \n\n Authorities were checking on the identities of the group. The sheriff said one of the men may have been from \nGuatemala, but he was unsure about the others.
