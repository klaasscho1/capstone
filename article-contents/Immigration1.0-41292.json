{"title": "America Can't Afford More Huddled Masses;Enforce Current Laws", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhat you said in \"Indecent Proposition in California\" (editorial, Oct. 25) is one of the reasons there is such a \nproposition and that it's going to pass overwhelmingly.\n\nYou acknowledge that there are illegal aliens in this country and then go on to say they are constitutionally entitled \nto the benefits that the proposition will take away from them.  Your solution to the problem is to have the Federal \nGovernment compensate the states for this.\n\nThat's not an appropriate solution -- having everyone chip in and pay for benefits that people are constitutionally \nentitled to once they have got away with breaking the law.\n\nWould not a better approach be to vigorously enforce our immigration laws to keep illegal aliens out of our \ncountry?\n\n \n\nGERALD DEUTSCH\n\nPort Washington, L.I., Oct. 25, 1994\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nDrawing.\n"}
