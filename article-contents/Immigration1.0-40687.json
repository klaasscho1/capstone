{"title": "RENO OPPOSES CALIF. INITIATIVE", "body": "\nAttorney General Janet Reno expressed opposition yesterday to a California ballot initiative that would cut off \nsocial services to illegal immigrants, including schools and health care. She said the Justice Department would \nreview the measure's constitutionality.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense to turn schoolteachers and nurses into Border Patrol agents,\" Reno said at her weekly news \nconference. \"It doesn't make sense to kick kids out of school or not give them immunizations.\"\n\nReno previously had declined to comment on the controversial Nov. 8 ballot initiative. But she finally came out \nagainst it after President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner all expressed \nstrong opposition.\n\nReno stopped short of saying the Justice Department would go to court against the initiative if the report \ndetermines it is unconstitutional and California voters approve it. \"We will review the report and review the law and \nmake a judgment at that time,\" she said.\n"}
