{"title": "In Philippines, Corruption Torrent Has Slowed;Expulsion for Marcoses", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhile Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, cannot be extradited from the United States for lack of an \nextradition treaty (''Marcos and Wife, 8 Others Charged by U.S. With Fraud,'' front page, Oct. 22), that does not \nmean they cannot be expelled from this country.\n\nAssuming the accuracy of your report that the Marcoses entered the United States in a ''refugee parole'' status, \nand that this status has not changed, they stand in the anomalous position of legally not having been ''admitted'' \nand are still potentially subject to ''exclusion and deportation'' under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nEven if their immigration status has changed, since they are not naturalized citizens they might well still be subject \nto deportation, assuming in both cases that they are eventually found guilty of the charges levied against them.\n\nWhile the Marcoses, once in exclusion or deportation proceedings, have certain substantive avenues of relief open \nto them, like any other aliens, it is by no means certain that such relief would be granted, depending on the facts \nthat develop during the criminal trial, as well as other extrinsic factors, and they could find themselves forced to \nleave the United States, if not perhaps to the Philippines, then to any other country that would accept them.\n\n \n\nPETER HIRSCH\n\n  New York, Oct. 23, 1988\n\nThe writer is chairman of the committee on immigration and naturalization of the New York County Lawyers' \nAssociation.\n"}
