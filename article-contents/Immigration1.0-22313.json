{"title": "New citizenship test to be tested by new immigrants", "body": "\nImmigrants in 10 cities around the country will be the first to try a new U.S. citizenship test, as part of a pilot \nproject in the redesign of the required exam.\n\nNone of the cities are in the Bay Area or California.\n\n``We're not trying to make the test harder,'' said Sharon Rummery, spokeswoman for the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. ``We want to refine the exam and get right down to what's important.''\n\nBeginning in January next year, volunteer immigrants will be recruited in Albany, N.Y.; Boston, Charleston, S.C.; \nDenver; El Paso; Kansas City, MO; San Antonio; Tucson and Yucama to take the new test as part of the pilot \nproject that's expected to last three to four months.\n\nThe redesign of the test will include ``getting rid of some of the more frivolous questions and make it meaningful for \nour new citizens,'' Rummery said.\n\nOne such question, Rummery said: What are the American flag colors?\n\nFrom the pilot project, USCIS will come up with a redesigned test and in 2008, it will be used nationwide.\n\nPermanent residents who have been in the United States for five years and qualify to apply for citizenship, are \nrequired to take a simple exam about American government and civics. They are usually asked half-dozen \nquestions from a set of about 100 questions.\n\n``We want to encourage people to understand our values as a nation,'' Rummery said. ``We want a new test that \nwill result in our new citizens being prepared citizens.''\n\nContact Jessie Mangaliman at jmangaliman@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5794.\n"}
