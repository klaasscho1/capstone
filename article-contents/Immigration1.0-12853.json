{"title": "5 HUNTED MEN LINKED TO FAKE PASSPORT RING", "body": "\nThe five illegal aliens wanted for questioning by the FBI's counterterrorist squad may be connected to a forgery \nring, officials said yesterday.\n\nThe FBI had no information that the men were connected to terrorist activity, the officials emphasized.\n\nThe FBI wants to question the men - believed to be Pakistani - in its probe of a group that makes false documents \nand passports.\n\n\"During the course of that investigation, these men came to our attention,\" bureau spokesman Edwin Cogswell \nsaid. \"We developed information that they were going to enter the U.S. on or about Dec. 24. We don't have any \nspecific information that they're connected to an attack or anything, but we're attempting to locate them.\"\n\nCogswell said the FBI has no reason to believe the men are ringleaders or manufacturers of the bogus documents, \nbut they may be lower-level conspirators.\n\nHe said the feds were not sure they were in the U.S., but Gov. Pataki said yesterday that they entered New York \nState from Canada on or near Christmas Eve.\n\n\"We don't know where they are now,\" Pataki said.\n\nThe New York FBI office was monitoring the situation, primarily because the Times Square New Year's Eve \ncelebration is always considered a potential terrorist target.\n\nThe FBI said the men were using the names Abid Noraiz Ali, Iftikhar Khozmai Ali, Mustafa Khan Owasi, Adil Pervez \nand Akbar Jamal.\n\nWhite House spokesman Scott McClellan said, \"We want to know why they are here. We want to question them . . . \nand find out more.\"\n"}
