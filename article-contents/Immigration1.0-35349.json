{"title": "The Good, the Best and the Border", "body": "\nHey, bud, you want some fake identification? It's not hard to find. In Texas, one forger provided whole ID packets, \nincluding Social Security card and birth certificate, for $75. If that's all an illegal alien needs to stay in this country, \nno wonder there are so many of them. Indeed, there's such a wave of false papers that some people now suggest \nsurrendering to the illegal tide.\nEditorial calls on House of Representatives to pass Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform measure; says measure \nhas shortcomings, but it is good first step in halting tide of illegal aliens (M)\n\nSure, they say, Congress may finally be on the verge of passing the big Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform bill \nthat's meant to put the United States back in control of its borders. But with all the forgeries, the argument goes, it \ncan't work, so what's the use?\n\nIt's an infuriating attitude, so defeatist as to be suspect. Tax evasion is increasing as more and more cash changes \nhands in the underground economy. Does that mean the Internal Revenue Service should stop trying to enforce \nTitle 26 of the U.S. Code? More people have been running red lights in New York City. Does that mean the police \nshould stop giving out tickets?\n\nOf course not, and to suggest that the nation should surrender to illegal immigration suggests a defeatism \nmotivated by special, selfish interest. On immigration, there's plenty of that, ranging from growers who want cheap \nlabor to Hispanic organizations that want easy entry.\n\nIf the United States is serious about controlling the borders, the Simpson-Mazzoli bill - already passed \noverwhelmingly by the Senate - is an essential starting point. There's no measure before the new session of \nCongress that more deserves public attention or prompt enactment by the House.\n\nIf controlling the borders is so important, why doesn't the Government enforce present laws against illegal entry? \nHeaven knows it tries. The Border Patrol is now up to 2,800 agents, an increase of 20 percent in just two years. \nBut the task remains hopeless because what's on the books is more loophole than law.  Yes, it is illegal for \nundocumented individuals to enter the country and to take jobs here. But it is not illegal for an employer to hire \nthem. So they keep flooding in, eager to take their chances as long as they can earn wages that are princely by \ncomparison with wages at home in Mexico or elsewhere. Until Congress closes the loophole, what the United \nStates displays at its borders is not a big stick but a big wink.  The Simpson-Mazzoli bill would not, by itself, create a \nbig stick. It would be far stronger if it included a reasonable, built-in system of worker identification instead of \nleaving that to be dealt with in three years. But that's a perfectionist objection. Immigration is a subject torn by \nideological contradictions and special interests. For the bill to have gotten this far has required repeated \ncompromise.  Even if enacted, Simpson-Mazzoli could still be torpedoed. It could not work without sufficient \nenforcement funds or without further steps, like an identification system. But unless it is passed, nothing \nconstructive is imaginable.  Simpson-Mazzoli is not the best possible immigration reform, yet it remains a good bill \nand a necessary one. Now it's up to the House leadership to insure that, after 19 months of debate, the measure \n\n\ndoes not falter on the last lap. To permit the best to become the enemy of the good can only insure victory for the \nworst.\n"}
