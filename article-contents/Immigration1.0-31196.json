{"title": "Arizona: Sheriff Spending Criticized", "body": "\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, known for efforts against illegal immigrants, inappropriately spent $99 million \nfrom two jail funds over the past eight years to pay for other law enforcement operations, including immigration \npatrols, county budget officials said. The figure released Wednesday is an update to an estimate made in \nSeptember by budget officials who said the sheriff's office was believed to have used up to $80 million over four or \nfive years from a jail tax on other purposes. Since then, officials said they discovered that the sheriff, Joe Arpaio, \nhad inappropriately spent money from a second jail account. The findings were sent to federal prosecutors, who \nare investigating Sheriff Arpaio on abuse of power allegations. He was not at a county meeting on Wednesday \nwhere the budget was discussed because he was at an immigration raid. But interim Chief Deputy Sheriff Jerry \nSheridan blamed an outdated payroll system for the mistake.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
