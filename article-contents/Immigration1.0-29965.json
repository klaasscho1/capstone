{"title": "Letters: End Philly's cooperation with immigration agency", "body": "\nMany Philadelphians recognize immigrants not as a threat, but as neighbors. Even undocumented immigrants are \nan integral part of our economy and society, this city and nation. \n\nSharing police department information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) undermines immigrants' \ntrust and, thereby, results in their refusal to report crimes or come forward as witnesses, leaving us all vulnerable. \nReporting information on people who have not been convicted also violates due process and the presumption of \ninnocence, fundamentals of our justice system. \n\nCongregations and immigrant communities across this city commend Mayor Nutter for wanting to end the city's \ncooperation with ICE (\"Nutter tells why he opposes Immigration access to arrest records,\" Friday). We now call \non District Attorney Seth Williams to stop giving ICE access to the Police Department's Preliminary Arraignment \nReporting System. \n\nWorking for justice and making room for the foreigner are integral to the national stories we celebrate at this time of \nyear and in this city. District Attorney Williams, let's make history in Philadelphia again. \n\nRev.
