{"title": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Congress Cancels a Vote to Increase Visas", "body": "\nOne week after announcing a compromise to increase the number of visas available for high-technology workers, \nCongressional leaders canceled planned votes today on the legislation under the threat of a veto.\n\nAlthough supporters of the legislation remained optimistic about the chances of a compromise with the White \nHouse, the canceled vote dashed hopes of relieving critical worker shortages before the fiscal year ends in \nSeptember.\n\nThe White House threatened a veto on Thursday night, expressing concerns that provisions to insure that American \nworkers would not be replaced with cheaper foreign labor were inadequate.\n\nThe 65,000 visas available this year for skilled foreign workers were used up in May. Technology companies have \nbeen lobbying heavily for an immediate increase this year, saying crucial projects, including the repair of Year 2000 \ncomputer problems, have been delayed by the shortage of workers with the necessary advanced computer \nprogramming and engineering skills.\n\nAmong concessions the Administration is seeking is a fee on employers who sponsor foreign workers. The money \nwould go into a fund to train American workers. The White House also wants stronger language to insure that \nAmericans are not being laid off and then replaced with cheaper foreign labor and an arbitration process for \nAmerican workers who think they have been wrongly let go.\n"}
