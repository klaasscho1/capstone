{"title": "PIANIST MAY BE DEPORTED", "body": "\nPianist Donald Vega has entertained Quincy Jones and Lionel Hampton and is seen as a jazz world wunderkind. \nImmigration officials say he's an illegal immigrant from Nicaragua and should go.\n\nThe 22-year-old University of Southern California junior, who was born in Nicaragua and entered the United States \nillegally in 1989, may get an Immigration and Naturalization Service deportation notice next month.\n\nIt's a prospect that has sent shock waves through the Los Angeles jazz community. Vega is considered one of the \nbest young jazz pianists in the country if not the world.\n\n\"Donald is first-class. You hardly run across someone that talented at that age. It would be devastating to send him \nhome,\" said bass player and arranger John Clayton, who has worked with Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole.\n\nVega was 8 years old when he started playing the piano in Masaya, Nicaragua. His parents refused to submit to the \nphilosophies of the Sandinista regime, however, and their lives were in danger, Clayton said.\n\nHis mother fled to the United States and soon sent for Donald, who has been living illegally in the country ever \nsince.\n\nVega realized last year that he could qualify for permanent residency by requesting a suspension of deportation. \nHe surrendered to the INS, declared his undocumented status and held out the hope that because he had lived in \nthe United States for seven years, he would be granted residency.\n\nBut the new immigration law signed by President Clinton last September lengthens to 10 years the required time a \nperson must live in this country to be eligible for a suspension of deportation. The law takes effect April 1.\n\nIf Vega's case isn't processed by then, he could be deported.\n"}
