{"title": "DEPORTATION PROCESS BEGINS AGAINST MAN / THE LANSDOWNE MAN WAS FOUND TO HAVE LIED ABOUT HIS WARTIME ACTIVITIES IN LITHUANIA.", "body": "\nThe Justice Department began deportation proceedings yesterday against an 80-year-old man who served in a \nLithuanian police unit that helped Germans murder Jews during World War II.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in May turned away Jonas Stelmokas' appeal of a judge's decision to revoke his U.S. \ncitizenship.\n\nYesterday, officials with the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations (OSI) filed deportation papers \nagainst the retired architect from Landsdowne in immigration court in Philadelphia.\n\nStelmokas' legal battle may not be over, though. Federal officials have said Stelmokas could challenge his \ndeportation before an immigration judge and, failing that, could appeal back up to the Supreme Court.\n\nStelmokas' attorney, John Rogers Carroll, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nStelmokas lost his citizenship in 1995, when a federal judge ruled that he had lied about his wartime activities to \ngain entry into the United States.\n\nWhen Stelmokas applied for immigration to the United States in 1949, he said he was discharged from the \nLithuanian army in 1940 and then worked as a teacher. He repeated those claims when he became a naturalized \ncitizen in 1955.\n\nBut OSI officials say Stelmokas served in an auxiliary police unit from 1941 until he entered the German Air Force \nin 1944. And the judge determined he had served as a guard commander at a Lithuanian ghetto where Jews \"were \nsubject to extreme deprivation, brutality and arbitrary shootings.\"\n\nThe Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's decision, saying that even though no eyewitnesses \ntestified that Stelmokas committed atrocities, his service in the police unit disqualified him from getting a U.S. visa.\n"}
