{"title": "Big Money, Cheap Labor", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"A Forgotten Threat: Free Trade in Population,\" (May 7), I despair that we can get the immigration \"breather\" the \narticle wisely recommends without first enacting true campaign finance reform. Many industries have become \ndeeply addicted to cheap immigrant labor. They maintain their supply by inundating Congress with money, \nreminding politicians to reward wealthy interests with even more permissive immigration policies.\n\nMeanwhile, the nation suffers industrialized overpopulation, environmental destruction, balkanized communities, \ncrowded schools, reduced natural resources and overtaxed infrastructure.\n\n \n\nBRENDA WALKER\n\nBerkeley, Calif., May 8\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
