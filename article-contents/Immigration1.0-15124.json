{"title": "U.S. Economic Policies Force Illegal Immigration", "body": "\nWhen the United States government gives more than $10 billion in subsidies to corn growers, it encourages them \nto produce a surplus that is then dumped onto world markets at artificially low prices. This has enormous \nconsequences on the domestic economies of third-world nations.\n\n     In Mexico, the price of corn has dropped 70 percent while production costs have risen. Mexico, where corn \noccupies half of the total land used for growing crops, has lost most of its farms over the last 10 years, bringing \nhavoc to the rural economy, forcing mass migration to the cities, bringing ruin and unemployment. And it has \nspurred the mass migration of campesinos to El Norte. \n\n In small town and large, in every community across America these economic refugees from American corporate \ngreed stand on street corners to try to get a day's pay doing work that no one else will do. They are resented in \nmany communities. People see the downsizing, the unemployment, the foreclosures, the homelessness and \nbankruptcy as not so very far from them and blame these immigrants.\n\nThis is the social and economic context of Farmingville, a community of ordinary middle class and working \nAmericans reeling from the larger forces of international trade rigged to the advantage of the privileged and the \nwealthy.\n\nMICHAEL O'NEILL\n\nWainscott\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
