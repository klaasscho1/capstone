{"title": "RULES SPELL TROUBLE FOR POOR IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nWASHINGTON Immigration officials yesterday published new rules that eventually could lead to the first-ever \ndeportations from the U.S. of individuals for being poor.\n\n\"We've never deported anybody as a public charge [indigent] before,\" said John Virtue, executive associate \ncommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nBut he said the new rules based on welfare and immigration reforms enacted by Congress and signed by President \nClinton will force the INS to move for the deportation of certain categories of immigrants who fail to reimburse the \ngovernment for public aid they received.\n\nHe said the rules, which take effect Dec. 19, will require about 565,000 sponsors of immigrants, including many of \nthose already here, to submit Affidavit of Support forms to show that they have income levels at 125% of the federal \npoverty line, or $ 20,062 for a family of four.\n\nThe forms must be submitted for all family-based immigrants, and for employment-based immigrants coming to \nthe U.S. to work for family members.\n\nThe new rules bar such immigrants from receiving food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income and \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families for five years from their date of entry into the country.\n\nAlthough the INS believes that \"family reunification should not be limited to the wealthy,\" Virtue said, \"if repayment \nis not made [for any benefits received under those programs], that person may be subject to removal from the U.S.\"\n"}
