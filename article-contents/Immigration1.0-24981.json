{"title": "Stop the Raids", "body": "\n   Feb. 26, 2009 (Calitics delivered by Newstex) -- \n\n Up in Bellingham, Washington, a town just a few miles from the Canadian border, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement conducted a \"raid\" on an engine plant, arresting 28 workers. The raid stirred outrage among many \nprogressives who had hoped that the secret police tactics of the Bush-era ICE (and I'm sorry, but that's really the \nbest way to describe it) would end with the new administration. \n\nThese \"raids\", several of which have hit California communities, making temporary orphans of children whose \nparents go to work and are thrown into prison camps with no warning or provision made for care of the children (or \nin cases in Texas, the children themselves are thrown into the camps), have been a prime target of immigrant rights \nand human rights groups. \n\nThese groups point out that immigration law can be enforced without destroying communities or violating basic \nrights. They also note that the raids rarely catch criminals. A New York Spanish-language paper, El Diario La \nPrensa,            called the raids \"a runaway program that has ruthlessly persecuted undocumented families\" and \ndemanded Obama and Napolitano stop them. \n\nThe outrage at these raids reached DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, who            claimed she did not know about \nthe raids and would investigate them: \n\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told lawmakers during a Wednesday hearing in Washington, D.C., \nthat she did not know about the raid before it happened. \nShe has asked ICE for answers. \n\"In my view,\" she said, \"we have to do workplace enforcement, and it needs to be focused on employers who \nintentionally and knowingly exploit the illegal labor market. I want to get to the bottom of this as well.\" \n\nSome Latino bloggers are not sure they buy the            Sgt Schulz defense: \n\nThe original Know Nothings were a nativist party in the 1800's. Call me cynical, pero I have a hard time buying that \nthe new Secretary of of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, didn't know anything about the ICE raid yesterday \nthat arrested 28 undocumented workers.... \n\nAs ICE raids continue while the Obama administration keeps telling us via Spanish language media that they care \nabout immigration, is this administration going to be the new Know Nothings? \n\n\nIt's good for immigrant rights activists to keep up the pressure on the Obama Administration. Whether the problem \nis Bush-era holdovers or an administration not yet willing to break with a policy that violated the human rights of \nthousands on a massive scale, these raids must stop. \n\nAlso, AG Eric Holder is            promising to end the raids on medical marijuana clubs. This is a big victory for \nCalifornia and might signal a shift in Obama's approach to the failed war on drugs, although it's worth noting this is \na small step forward. Let's hope that Napolitano and Holder are both serious about ending these raids. \n\nUPDATE: \"These raids are not a long-term solution\" says the White House. A good start, but I'd cut out the words \n\"long-term\" - the raids don't solve a damn thing.\n                                 \n Newstex ID: CALI-0001-32348247 \n\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed on blogs distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (\"Blogs on Demand\u00ae\") are solely the \nauthor's and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.
