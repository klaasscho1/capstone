He was being held Wednesday afternoon at the Hernando County Jail in lieu of $ 15,000 \nbail.\nRAPE\n\nThe incident began about 10:15 p.m. as the girl walked past the suspect's house. Authorities were not releasing the \ngirl's name because of the nature of the crime.\n\nA man sitting on the porch asked the girl for a cigarette. When she went to give him one, he dragged her into the \nhouse and shut the door, the report said.\n\nWhen the girl tried to fight off an attack, the 190-pound man pinned her to the floor and forced her to have sex, the \nreport said.\n\nLater, he gave her $ 20 and told her not to tell anyone what happened, the report said. Authorities were alerted \nsoon after she left the house.\n\n\"It's not clear if she had ever seen him before or had any contact with him,\" Capt. Ray Schumacher said.\n\nThe girl's mother, who lives in Brooksville, was taken into custody for psychological evaluation a few days ago after \nshe tried to commit suicide, Schumacher said. The girl was supposed to be turned over to her father, who lives \noutside the county.\n\n\"We're still looking into why she was back in Brooksville,\" Schumacher said.\n\nThe report said Estrada told police he had consensual sex with the girl.\n\nFlorida law states that consensual sex between an adult and a 13-year-old is a felony, although less severe than \nnon-consensual sex between the same people. Brooksville had no reported rapes in 1998, according to Florida \nDepartment of Law Enforcement statistics. The county had 72 reports last year.\n\nEstrada, who told the arresting deputy that he was in the country illegally, has no criminal record in Hernando \nCounty.\n\n\n\"'This appears to be an isolated incident,\" Schumacher said.\n"}
