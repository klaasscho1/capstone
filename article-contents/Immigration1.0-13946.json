{"title": "Siding Against the Law-Abiding", "body": "\n Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D) recently vetoed legislation that would have prohibited in-state discounts on \ncollege tuition for people who are in this country illegally. Noting that state regulations deny the benefit already \n(although some colleges ignore the regulation), Warner pronounced the measure a ploy \"to score a political victory \nagainst 'illegal aliens.' \" At the same time, Warner rejected the suggestion of Del. Phillip Hamilton (R-Newport \nNews) to extend in-state tuition rates to dependents of military personnel stationed in Virginia who have legal \nresidency elsewhere. \n\n Hmm. Advocates for illegal immigrants generally vote Democratic; members of the military tend to vote Republican. \nExactly who is more intent on scoring a political victory? \n\n Illegal immigration is an intractable problem because it can be neither discussed nor addressed. To mention its \ndetriments invites accusations of xenophobia and racism. \n\nCertainly, everyone sympathizes with the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. But pretending it is immaterial \nwhether immigrants are here legally or illegally is to pretend that the invited guest is no different from the \ntrespasser. Is Warner unable to discern the difference, or does he find it more politic to turn a blind eye? \n\n Although illegal immigrants typically are hard workers, they still place a burden on taxpayers. As part of the \nunderground economy, they often avoid payroll taxes. Moreover, much of what they earn isn't recycled locally but is \ninstead sent back to their native countries. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that illegal immigrants in the \nUnited States send $ 23 billion to other countries each year. \n\n Meanwhile, Virginia spends more than $ 4 million annually paying their medical bills and more than $ 60 million \neducating their children. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, incarcerating criminal \nnoncitizens in the commonwealth's prisons cost taxpayers between $ 8 million and $ 10 million last year. \n\n The price of coming to the United States can be even higher for the illegal immigrants themselves. Human \nsmugglers charge stiff fees and subject their clients to extreme danger; many illegal immigrants have suffocated \nwhile being transported hidden inside boxcars and trucks. The Red Cross estimates that every other day a Central \nAmerican trying to jump aboard a train bound for the United States loses a limb. A University of Houston study of \nmigrants detained by immigration officials in Texas found that one in six females reported being raped while trying \nto reach this country. \n\n\n Even if illegal immigrants could get to this country safely and become self-supporting, how does it benefit Virginia \nto provide them with a college education? \n\n It is against the law to hire them, so we are educating the unemployable. Illegal immigrants cannot vote, so they \ndon't contribute to an informed electorate. The principal argument for allowing illegal immigrants to remain in this \ncountry is that the economy depends on their services: They will do menial work that Americans won't do. If so, why \ndo they need a college education to change sheets, tend parking garages, drive taxis or wash cars? \n\n Offering subsidies that yield no reciprocal benefits reflects civic generosity, but government policy should have \nmore substantial bases than \"it's nice to share.\" \n\n Imagine how Lubomir Chocholak must feel. Earlier this year, a federal court in Norfolk sentenced him to 27 months \nin prison for hiring illegal immigrants. Because he turned a blind eye to immigration status, Chocholak was sent to \nthe jug. Some of Virginia's college administrators do the same thing but boast of their benefaction. \n\n Honorable people may disagree about this nation's immigration laws -- e.g., is it prudent to allow visitors from \ncountries that sponsor terrorism? How many of the world's 6 billion people can the United States accommodate? \nBut to implicitly support illegal immigration is to side against the law-abiding, and that is an unseemly position for \na Virginia governor to take. \n\n If Warner opposes existing immigration laws, he can work to change them. Regardless, he is obligated to ensure \nthat Virginia complies with federal statutes. But there is little chance he will press for compliance, because that \nmeans protecting taxpayers' interests. \n\nAnd that is not how Democrats score political victories. \n\nscarboroughsfare@aol.com \n"}
