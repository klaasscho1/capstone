{"title": "Tancredo Gets Matching Funds", "body": "\n  Sep. 13, 2007 (ColoradoPols.com delivered by Newstex) --  From \u2003       \u2003    The Denver Post: Tom Tancredo's \npresidential quest qualified for federal matching funds Wednesday, a boost his campaign said will keep it alive \nawhile longer... Tancredo, a Littleton Republican known for his criticism of U.S. immigration policies, now will get a \ndollar-for-dollar match up to the first $250 of every contribution he's received this year... In paperwork filed June 30 \nwith the Federal Election Commission, Tancredo had raised $2.8 million and had about $556,000 on hand. \nQualifying for matching funds means Tancredo's campaign can get a bank loan for about $2.5 million, Buchanan \nsaid. That loan is paid back with the matching funds, which will come beginning next year... ...To qualify for \nmatching funds, candidates must raise at least $100,000 by collecting $5,000 in 20 different states, in amounts no \ngreater than $250 from any individual. Tancredo raised about $176,000 through 3,082 contributions from 25 states. \nSo far, only Tancredo and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have qualified for and decided to take the matching funds, \nthe FEC said. Most of the top-tier candidates have opted out of the system because it requires them to spend less \nthan about $50 million. But the news isn't all good for Tancredo. The Republican congressman has repeatedly \ncalled for the U.S. to deport all illegal immigrants, which it turns out, \u2003       \u2003    would be pretty expensive. The \ndepartment of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement estimates that \u2003       \u2003    it would cost $94 billion to deport \nevery illegal immigrant in the U.S. \n\n>\n\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed on blogs distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (\"Blogs via Newstex\") are solely the \nauthor's and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.
