{"title": "Clinton prepares crackdown on smugglers of illegal aliens", "body": "\nEven as dozens of ships crammed with Chinese sail for U.S. shores, President Clinton announced a crackdown \nFriday on organized crime syndicates that have turned \"this transport in human cargo and traffic in human misery\" \ninto a $ 3 billion-a-year enterprise.\n\nCalling the smuggling of illegal aliens \"a shameful practice of unspeakable degradation and unspeakable \nexploitation,\" the president said he has brought together 12 federal agencies, the White House Domestic Policy \nCouncil and the National Security Council to combat this \"major crime problem.\"\n\nMr. Clinton made the announcement at a ceremony in which he named Doris Meissner, a former Justice \nDepartment immigration official, as his choice to head the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nThe president's plan, much of which must be approved or rejected by Congress, calls for steps to make smugglers \nof aliens subject to tough racketeering laws and measures to combat smuggling operations at their source, \nintercept smuggling ships en route and detain foreigners smuggled into the United States.\n\nFive bills already in Congress include many of the same provisions.\n"}
