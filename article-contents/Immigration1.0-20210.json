The \n3SC central defender may have been brought back to give some height to the defence, in pairing with Austin \nObaroakpo, who maintains his place and also to give him back his confidence.\n\nUsman Mohammed has also shaken off the groin injury he picked up against Tunisia with Bartholomew Ibenegbu, \nreverting to a bench role.\n\nThe Eagles need only a point in today's game to be assured of a place in the quarter final. The other Group C \nmatch sees Tunisia and Niger locking horns with the winner almost assured of a quarter-final place.\n\nThe quarter-final matches are scheduled for Stade de Kigali and Rubavu Stadium on January 31.\n\nEagles starting XI vs Guinea (4-3-2-1 formation): Ikechukwu Ezenwa - Matthew Etim, Chima Akas, Austin \nObaroakpo, Jamiu Alimi - Paul Onobi, Ifeanyi Matthew - Osas Okoro, Prince Aggreh, Usman Mohammed - Tunde \nAdeniji\n\nStay with for live updates of another West African derby between Nigeria and Guinea.\n\nLiveblog\n\n15.07\n\nGuinea getting the better of the early exchanges.

We handed over a secured country in 1979, but by 1984, \nnobody knew how much Nigeria was owing.\n\n\"The situation now is aggravated by the downturn in the petroleum industry. It is now per barrel and we have debt \nservice of about N1.5 trillion and we have commitment on the ground.\n\n\n\n\"We have to reorganize the NNPC. We have to introduce the TSA. There were 45 accounts in the NNPC alone. \nMinistry of Defence had about 70 accounts.\n\n\"We have got about N1.5 trillion through the TSA.\n\n\"The oil downturn is very unfortunate for this government.\n\n\"Check previous records. Over 90% were recurrent. No country can develop without capital projects. We were in \nvery very bad shape.\"\n\n20.02\n\n\"When I said that the war has been technical won, I said the capacity of Boko Haram to unleash attacks from \ncamps and barracks have been stopped.\n\n\"If Hijap is found to be a problem, the government will have no option than to take a decision on it. The people will \nhave to consider between it and their security.\"\n\n19.57\n\n\"If this thing (suicide bombing) continues, Hijab would have to be banned.\"\n\n19.56\n\n\"I said the capacity of Boko Haram to attack institutions or communities have been stopped.

There are all sorts of allegations. So, we just have to wait for the report.\"\n\n19.53\n\n\"The President of Iran spoke to me about the situation. But, I told him that as a government we have a system we \nmust follow. \"As the head of the Federal Government, I told him I will have to wait for the official report from the \nKaduna State government from their investigations.\n\n\"To be fair to the both sides, we have to wait for the report of the inquiry.\"\n\n\n\n19.48\n\nPresident Buhari says he will only comment on the Shi'ite crisis after receiving reports of investigations by the \npolice and Kaduna State Government.\n\n19.46\n\n\"The Benin IDP camp is a good intention that went sour. \"Despite the problem, the Edo State Governor, Adams \nOshiomhole, was kind enough to have found school for the children. \"The Federal Government is aware of the \nsituation and ready to take them to where they came from.\"\n\n19.42\n\nInternally Displaced Persons\n\n\"We have about two million IDPs, over 70% are women and children. Over 65% of the children are orphans.\n\n\"Some Nigerians contributed money, about 25 Billion Naira, a committee was set up to utilise the funds.\n\n\"Within the week I was sworn in, I went to Chad and Niger.\n\n\"I was impressed with the goodwill they gave Nigeria on this issue.\n\n\"The G7 has sent training teams, and have given us some military hardware.\n\n\"We are more concerned with the orphans, a chance for them not to lose the opportunity for education. Some \nprogress is being made on the ground.\"\n\n19.36\n\n\"We are working with Niger, Chad and Cameroun on the girls.

I have not taken anybody who is facing corruption charges.\"\n\n19.25\n\nStill on crude oil theft\n\nThe problem of NNPC is the involvement of international institutions such as shipping lines and financial institutions.\n\nWe would ask for the cooperation of other countries to get monies lodged from sales of oil in different accounts and \nnot that of the Federal Government.\n\nAsset declaration not so public after all, not fully made.\n\n\"I have declared my assets four times in the past. You have the constitutional right to go to the relevant government \nagency to go and seek for it.\n\n\"They were deposited at the Ministry of Justice.

That is why we are being thorough now.\n\nBy the end of first quarter of next year, we would be in a position to tell Nigerians how far we have gone.\n\n19.18\n\n\"We have to be patient and await outcome of courts decision.

Some, \"Governorship\". One has \ninscription Ijaw LGA, Amassoma Ward three.\n\nThere are 10 ballot boxes on one truck, and 14 on the other.\n\nThe three men who came down from the truck chanting war songs are no longer in sight.

Three men came \ndown from the vehicles chanting local war songs.\n\nThey claim they are from Southern Ijaw and had beat 'soldiers' firing at them to return the ballot boxes behind the \nvehicles. They do not look like INEC officials and everyone is dazed and not sure how to react. But there is a clear \nindication the ballot boxes will not be accepted.\n\n14.16\n\n\"I admonish to be always be positive and not to criticize our leaders all the time so that there can be development,\" \nhe said.\n\n14.10\n\nThe Ooni has dedicated his staff of office to young people in Ife and the entire Nigeria.\n\n\n\n14.09\n\n\"I thank God for bringing me to this throne. He's the King of kings,\" the Ooni said.\n\n14.07\n\nThe new Ooni giving his first public speech. \"It is a new dawn in Ife,\" he said.\n\n14.02\n\nOsun state governor, Aregbseola, presents staff of office to the new Ooni.

Traditional worshippers rub metals in a noisy \nmanner as part of their prayers.\n\n12.27\n\nOne would imagine this is a purely traditional event, but Muslim and Christian prayers said to invite God's \npresence.\n\n12.23\n\nJournalists block traditional rulers' view. They complain and anchor begs that cameramen should give way. Some \nshift, but the job has to be done.\n\n12.17\n\nThe rendition of Nigerian National Anthem was followed by the Ife Anthem, emotionally chorused by the guests.\n\n12.11\n\nThe National anthem is rendered and the coronation is officially kicked off.\n\n12.09\n\nBola Tinubu causes a stir, as he arrives with Rauf Aregbesola\n\n12.08\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Saad Abubakar II, and Olu of Warri, arrive, take their seats.\n\n12.07\n\nHeat tortures guests, no seats\n\nThe canopy collapsible hall, venue of the coronation of the new Ooni of Ife, Adeyeye Ogunwusi, is hot and guest \nare enduring severe heat.\n\nAlthough there are about 40 standing air-conditioners in the hall, the number of persons far exceeds the actual \ncapacity of the hall.\n\nHalf of the guests in the hall have no seats, and all are using improvised hand fans to cool themselves.\n\n11.50\n\nCrowd problems as dignitaries enter.

Bayelsa is one of the few states in \nthis country where no governor has been re-elected to complete a second term, and because of that, in my view, \nour development has also been stunted. Since the creation of Bayelsa, we haven't had any governor do a full two \nterms. Each and every one of them has done one term; like D.S.P. Alamieyeseigha, a few days into his second \nterm, his tenure was truncated, Sylva did one term, Goodluck Jonathan did just one, and Dickson is just completing \nhis first term.

Thanks for following. See you then.\n\n22.54\n\nSpace Constraint: INEC staff Assail Journalist\n\nA mild drama occurred at the Conference room of the Independent National Electoral Commission, venue for the \ncollation and announcement of results, as an INEC staff and a journalist engaged themselves in a physical combat.\n\nMatters came to a head when the INEC official simply identified as Austine, accused the journalist of disorganising \nthe projectors he was setting up for the result presentation.\n\nThe space was tight and the sitting position of the journalist was too close to Austine's setup.\n\nAustine urged the journalist to relocate, but the latter did not take it kindly as he felt insulted that Austine had \nspoken to him rudely.\n\n\"I will slap you now,\" and \"I will kill you now,\" rent the air as they clenched their fist ready for combat.\n\nColleagues from the both divide came rushing in to save the whole room from being engulfed by violence.\n\nInterestingly, nerves have calmed and both men are now going about their duties as if nothing had happened \nbetween them.\n\n22.28\n\nInsufficient Seats, Space, Threaten Smooth Announcement of Results\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission has provided only 37 plastic seats for journalists, party agents and \nobservers at the collation center.\n\nThe commission is using its conference room, which is about 22ft by 20ft, too small to accommodate those who will \nbe attending the event.\n\nCameramen, while trying to find spaces for their tripods, engaged themselves in a brawl. It took the intervention of \nsome senior journalists to calm down the tempers.\n\nAlso, two journalists had a shouting match over who should take a particular seat.\n\nOfficials of the INEC appears to be busy over other matters, leaving the visitors to figure out how to cover the event \nwithin the limited space.\n\n21.46\n\nINEC To Declare Results As They Come\n\nKogi state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Hassan Pai, has said that the results would be taken and announced \nas they trickle in from the local governments.\n\nHe said the commission was tracking the collation and movement of the results from the Registration Area Centres \nto the commission's headquarters.\n\nMr. Pai gave the hints as he entered the conference room to see preparations for the results collation.\n\n\"if we leave the results till tomorrow it will become too much to handle, so it is better to take the results as they \ncome,\" he said.\n\n\n\nNo results have arrived,however, election observers and party agents are arriving.\n\n21.13\n\nSecurity Tight At INEC headquarters As Results Delay Coming\n\nThere is a tight security at the head quarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Lokoja, as it \nprepares to begin the collation of results from the 21 local governments.\n\nAlthough the results are yet to come in, those entering the complex had to face strident checks and screening \nbefore being allowed in.\n\nRoads linking the street where the INEC office is located has been blocked by armed police officers.\n\n21.08\n\nGroup lauds early arrival of election materials\n\nA Transition Monitoring Group, TMG, Quick Count, on Saturday said 75 per cent of the polling units in the Kogi \ngovernorship election had witnessed early arrival of election officials and materials. This is contained in a report \nissued to journalists in Lokoja by the group's spokesperson, Armsfree Ajanaku. It said INEC personnel and \nmaterials arrived 75 per cent of the polling units across the state by 7:30 a.m. The report also said accreditation of \nvoters started at 9am in about 92 per cent of the total number of polling units visited by its observers. According to \nthe report, there was 97 percent security presence across the polling units, adding that the APC and PDP agents \nrecord 95 per cent presence at the polling units.\n\n17.39\n\nAudu Defeats Wada in Tunde Ogbeha's Unit\n\nIt was victory for the All progressive Congress defeating PDP 200 to 158 votes at Lokoja Club, the unit of Former \nSenator Tunde Ogbeha.\n\nOgbeha incidentally is the Director General of Idris Wada Campaign Organisation.\n\n17.14\n\nPolling Units Results Collected So Far\n\nPU 029, Zariagi ward, Adavi LGA.

The polling units monitored by \nPREMIUM TIMES showed less than 35 per cent turn out. For example at Agwan Rimi Unit, with 1340 registered \nvoters, only 392 persons, 29.25 percent turned out to be accredited. Also, at Unit 014 LGA Secretariat under Ward \nA, only 243 of 1176 registered voters, 20.66 percent, turned up for accreditation. Also at unit 006, Ward B, only 368 \nvoters turned up for accreditation, which is about 30 percent of 1227 registered voters. In the same vein, unit 001 \nWard B had 1,477 registered voters, only 403, which is 27.29 percent came out to be accredited. One of the \npresiding officers noted that the figures only represented those who came to be accredited and nothing gives any \nassurance that all who were accredited would eventually come out tom vote.\n\n15.41\n\nVoting is still on going across Ofu LGA. At Ogbagbo 1 and 2, Aloji ward, voters were seen on queue in light \natmosphere. They expressed satisfaction with process.\n\n15.27\n\nVoting has ended at PU 12 Crowther Memorial College, Ward A, Lokoja. Counting of votes is about to begin.\n\n14.53\n\nCalm returns to Wada's unit - Odu Ogboyaga 001, Odu Ward, Dekina LGA.\n\nMore copies incident form have been made available for details of those who failed biometric authentication. Also, \nwe observed card readers are now working well. The Polling Officer had earlier promised Mr. Wada the machines \nwould be fixed.\n\nYet, accrediation exercise is still on going, with more than 100 persons still on the queue.\n\nHowever, at the neigbouring unit - Odu-Ogbaloto, voting has begun. Those who had voted said the exercise started \n1.30pm.\n\n14.38\n\nAt polling unit 006, Adankolo Primary School, Lokoja, Suleiman Abubakar, an agent of the APC alleges that the \nPDP agents are sharing money at the polling centre. Security agents on the ground are intervening. However, \nvoting is in progress, peacefully.\n\n14.37\n\n\n\nVoting started in some Units in Lokoja. This is Crowther Memorial unit\n\n14.13\n\nAt Ajikpome open space polling unit, Odu Ward 2, Dekina LGA, there are more than 300 voters still awaiting \naccreditation.\n\n\"But they are eager to vote and they have been calm,\" an observer from INEC, who identified herself as Sefiya, \nsaid.\n\nAccording to the Polling Officer, two factors caused the delay.\n\nFirst, one of the two card readers was not working initially. \"But it was later fixed and the two are not working very \nwell now,\" the PO said.\n\n\"Then, we are under staffed here,\" she complained. \"We don't see other assistant presiding officers.\"\n\nShe also expressed fear that there could be nobody to \"man the voting point when voting starts.\"\n\n14.06\n\nFuel Tanker Crash, Hazard Scooping\n\nA fuel Tanker crash into a mechanic workshop in Ajaokuta, while trying to avoid a broken down truck in the middle \nof the expressway.\n\nThe tanker which is loaded with PMS is leaking out while some youths around the area took out time to collect the \nleaking fuel.\n\nA car belonging to the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, ran into the situation and seized the opportunity \nto refuel from the scooped petroleum product.\n\nThe vehicle quickly zoomed off as it got enough to continue its journey, leaving the small community to the \nimminent danger of an explosion.\n\n14.03\n\nVoter Apathy In Smart Adeyemi's Town\n\nThere was low turn out of voters at Iyara, in Ijumu Local Government Area, where Smart Adeyemi comes from.\n\nResidents attributed it to the fact that none of the major contenders had serious following in the area.\n\nHowever, accreditation which closed some minutes ago, was peaceful and card reader problems were minimal and \nmade little impact.\n\n14.01\n\nAccording to observers across wards in Kogi Kotonkarfe LGA, accreditation is still on going.\n\nOne of the observers, Rahman Ibrahim, said accreditation would end when the last person on the queue \nundergoes the process.\n\nThe observers said the exercise has been \"peaceful\", \"hitch free\" and \"credible\".\n\nOn the card readers, one observer said it had functioning well.\n\n\"But it is slow in some areas,\" another one added.\n\n\n\n13.22\n\nAt polling unit 002 Karaworo South, Lokoja, with 1660 registered voters, accreditation is over. Accreditation is also \nover in most units in Lokoja.\n\n13.18\n\nIta-Aja 1 polling unit, Anyigba, Dekina LGA. Just five persons left on the queue for accreditation. The situation is \ncalm. Voters said the card reader did not malfunction. The Polling Officer said \"all the card readers worked very \nwell.\"\n\nHe said the voting will start 1.30pm.\n\n13.15\n\nSo far, in Dekina LGA, PREMIUM TIMES observed that many voters failed biometric accreditation.\n\nIn such situation, INEC procedure requires that Polling Officers enter details of those who fail into incident form and \nthey would be allowed to vote once they are electronically accredited by card reader and PVC.\n\nHowever, in all the Polling units visited, only one incident form was provided per unit. Therefore, officials have to \nresort to using papers to enter voters' details.\n\n13.12\n\nOlofu open space polling unit 012, Anyigba, Dekina LGA. Accreditation still on going. The polling officer complained \nof biometric authentication failure for many voters. There is just one incident form. But the PO said sheet of paper \nwas used to get details of those who failed biometric accreditation.\n\n12.44\n\nMoney changing Hands\n\nThe ugly practice of financial inducements at polling units surfaced on Saturday as political parties secretly dole out \ncurrency notes to potential voters.\n\nPremium Times observed a party official at Unit 001, Ganaja Ward 14, Ajaokuta, mustering funds for inward \ndistribution.\n\nThe same incident was witnessed at Ganaja Unit 009, where the two major parties, APC and PDP were trying to \noutdo each other in money distribution.\n\n12.35\n\nWada fails Card Reader accreditation\n\nGovernor Wada arrives for accreditation. He came with members of his family. Mr. Wada who went straight for \naccreditation without joining the queue. He failed electronic accreditation. He then had to fill the incident form.\n\nCommenting, the governor said, \"This is my polling unit. How can all the card readers be failing? Yet you have just \none incident form. It is unacceptable. The whole world is watching this election.\"\n\nHis wife passed accreditation but her name was not in the voters' register. Mrs. Wada expressed dissatisfaction, \nsaying \"this is to manipulate the election.\"\n\n11.11\n\n\n\nAt Polling Unit 021 Achai/Dogo street Adankolo, Lokoja, with 1389 registered voters, accreditation is in progress \nseamlessly.\n\nAt Family Health Centre Adankolo polling unit 5, Lokoja. Accreditation of more than one thousand voters is in \nprogress at the moment. Security agents are on the ground, and there is no incident.\n\nOdu Ogboyaga 001 unit, Odu Ward, Dekina LGA. This is Governor Wada's polling unit. Accreditation exercise has \nbeen hitch free like other places.\n\nAt 10.56 a.m. Mr. Wada is still being expected for accreditation.\n\n10.50\n\nAt Odu-Ogbaloto unit, Ward 1, Dekina LGA, Patrick Shaibu, a PDP stalwart in the area, said the \"only problem we \nare having is that the card reader machine is slow.\n\n\"Also, it can't read some voters' fingerprints but there is just one incident form here.\"\n\nThe Polling Officer, a female Youth Corp member, confirmed Mr. Shaibu's claims.\n\nShe said the card reader is \"not very slow...just normal issue really.\"\n\nThe incident forms for those who failed biometric accreditation have been used up.\n\nThe Polling Officer said an order was been given to \"get a sheet of paper for those whose fingerprints can not be \nauthenticated.\"\n\n10.35\n\nOdu-Ogbaloto Polling Unit, Ward 1, Dekina LGA. \"The situation is encouraging; no problem,\" a teacher said. The \nteacher added he would not mention his name because \"this is a political situation\" and \"I don't want anybody to \nwitch-haunt me.\"\n\nMeanwhile this is the first polling unit in Dekina where police officials are sighted. They stand by the road, without \ninterference in the process.\n\n\"if the situation continues like this, the election is well and credible,\" a voter, Jacob Awodi said.\n\n10.20\n\nTension in Ganaja As Card Readers Close Accreditation\n\n\"Accreditation closed\" is the reading of some card readers at Ganaja Unit 009, when fingers are placed on them for \naccreditation.\n\nThe polling unit which has seven voting points with 3773 registered voters is famed for violence.\n\nAs voters express frustration, the electoral officers are working hard to fix the problem.\n\n\"We have been here since morning and we have not accredited one person with the card reader because it will \nread the card but when you place your finger, it will say 'accreditation closed,' Bako Abraham, Assistant Presiding \nOfficer in charge of Voting Point 1, said.\n\n\"We have called our supervisors, and they said they are sending an engineer, when that will be we don't know.\"\n\nHe said the incident form is the alternative but because almost every body might have to fill the for,, the unit might \nrun out of the paper.\n\n\n\nVoting point 4 is also witnessing the same problem, but waiting voters complained that the machine was tampered \nwith and needed to be urgently fixed.\n\nMeanwhile a good number of voters are sitting idle waiting until the machines begin to work again.\n\nThe apprehension is that given the history of the unit, officials are not certain if the voters will continue to be patient.\n\n10.15\n\nAjiyolo-Ojaji Polling Unit 1 and Odu Ward 2, Dekina LGA. Accreditation is on going. Like other polling units so far \nvisited in Dekina LGA, security officials are not on ground to monitor the process. However, the process is going on \nsmoothly and voters expressed satisfaction.\n\n10.09\n\nIn Ogbabo polling unit 1 and 2, Alobi ward, Ofu LGA, accreditation is on going and the turn out is high.\n\nBarack 1, 2 and 3 polling units, Abocho ward, Dekina LGA. Accreditation on going. The situation here is calm, even \nwith no security official present.\n\n09.59\n\nContrary to the declaration of the Police that the military will have no role in the elections, military personnel were \nseen on Saturday mounting road blocks in Lokoja, the state capital. The personnel who were armed naval officials \nrestricted movements and conducted searches as some motorists tried to make their way through the streets. \nDeputy Inspector General of Police, Leroy Sotonye, said on Friday that the military will only be called in only when \nthere is an overwhelming security challenge.\n\n09.42\n\nDistribution of kits and electoral materials started about 7:20 a.m. at INEC headquarters on Marine road. Vehicles \ncarrying electoral personnel are moving to different local government areas.\n\nAs observed by Situation Room the previous day, there are indications that welfare of security personnel deployed \nis not properly taken care of. Two of the police officers deployed to Dekina LGA, Idris Wada's LGA, were \ncomplaining over poor welfare.\n\n\"Oga you say make we go but nothing for bele?\" one of the officers asked INEC staff leading the team to Dekina.\n\n09.33\n\nCard Reader Malfunction\n\nBarely an hour into the accreditation exercise in the Kogi governorship election, some card reader machines have \nstarted malfunctioning.\n\nAt Polling Unit 015, Ward A in Lokoja, the electoral officers are having a hard task as one of the card readers won't \nrecognize finger prints.\n\nThe Presiding Officer had put a call through to the operation room for a replacement.\n\nBut voters on queue were restless for a while but officials efforts to calm frayed nerves paid off.

\npartisan military operatives to assist it in rigging Saturday's Kogi state governorship election, \"instead of allowing \nthe forces to concentrate on their statutory role of providing peripheral security during elections\".\n\nThe party said \"intelligence\" information available to it shows that some compromised military personnel led by a \nsenior officer of the rank of a Colonel have been detailed by the Presidency to carry out specific assignments in \nsupport of APC candidate in the election.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Olisa Metuh, in a statement on Friday, said the development was not \nonly a recipe to civil disorder but also a clear invitation to total disruption of free and fair polls in the state if not \nimmediately checked.\n\nMr. Metuh said, \"Available intelligence shows that the deployment to Kogi state, of the Army Colonel, who is a \nknown APC sympathizer is part of the fallout of last week's secret meeting coordinated by the Secretary to the \nGovernment of the Federation (SGF), where orders were issued to clamp-down on PDP members and supporters \nto pave way for some pliable INEC officials to manipulate the election in favour of the APC.\n\n\"Compromised troops have already been detailed to Dekina Local Government Area, the largest PDP stronghold in \nthe state and home of Governor Idris Wada, where they have been instructed to create panic, strong-arm PDP \nsupporters, frighten and scare away voters, ostensibly to deprive the our party of its expected large votes from the \narea.\n\n\"We are also aware of how the head of Security of APC candidate's Campaign Organization, a retired Army \nGeneral, is coordinating the movement of partisan security operatives into other key local governments, including \nIgalamela, Ofu, Ankpa and Idah, to harass and frighten PDP supporters and provide a leeway for the APC to \nmanipulate the election.\n\n\"The PDP also has information of the copious involvement of a retired police officer, who is working with some men \nof the Directorate of Security Services (DSS) in providing illegal arms, vehicles and cover for APC thugs who have \nbeen positioned to attack PDP supporters during the election.\n\n\"We find it absolutely shocking that President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government, a huge beneficiary of free, \nfair and credible election conducted by the PDP, would so early in the day, seek to corrupt the electoral system and \nwillfully attempt to subvert the will of the people.\n\n\n\n\"The PDP however notes that no amount of force and intimidation can bend the will of the Kogi people from \nappropriately exercising their franchise and using every means within the law to protect their mandate.\n\n\"While we charge our members and the entire people of Kogi state to remain vigilant and continue to assert their \nconstitutional rights and liberty, we also call on the security forces to note that their duty is primarily to the nation \nand its citizens, and as such must ensure that they do not become tools in the hands of anti-democratic forces \nseeking to truncate our democracy.\"\n\n16.28\n\nPolice uncovers plans to import thugs,

the inconveniences that might be experienced on \nElection Day.\n\n\"If you know you are going to travel through Kogi State, you are advised to either postpone, suspend the trip, go by \nflight or take alternative routes because you will be stopped by the police,\" Mr. Sotonye said.\n\n\"We have intelligence that some people are trying to smuggle in thugs and ammunitions and all sorts of things.\n\n\"You will be screened and searched. It will be a distraction to the police and we don't want to be distracted.\"\n\nThe DIG warned politicians and troublemakers to stay away from polling units and election area as the police were \nprepared to deal with offenders during and after elections.\n\nAccording to him, \"Our officers have been asked to use their phones to take pictures and videos of incidences so \nthat such persons can be apprehended even after the election,\" the police boss stated.\n\n\"If we cannot arrest the culprits immediately, we can use the pictures to arrest them after the election and provide \nevidences to the Election Petitions Tribunal.\"\n\nMr. Sotonye said funds had been provided for police personnel involved in covering the election and deployment of \nthe personnel had commenced in different locations.\n\nHe said the allowances would be paid into their accounts as soon as the full details of the list of personnel were \nascertained.\n\nHe however noted that some of them might not receive the alerts until Monday because banks would not operate \nfully on Friday.\n\nThe police chief urged the electorate to be peaceful before and after casting their votes, warning those who had no \nbusiness with the elections to stay at home.\n\nPDP Accuses APC of Plans to Rig\n\n\n\nAddressing journalists in the office of the state deputy governor's office on Friday, Phrank Shaibu, the Chief \nCommunication Manager to Mr. Wada, claimed the PDP had uncovered a plot by the APC and its candidate, \nAbubakar Audu, to use military officers and thugs to \"harass and intimidate\" voters.\n\nHe also alleged that some electoral personnel had been compromised to ensure victory for the APC on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Mr. Shaibu, a military officer in the rank of Lt. Colonel was deployed to Dekina Local Government \nArea, to \"work in cahoot with the APC to intimidate and harass voters.\" Mr. Wada hails from Dekina LGA.\n\nMr. Shaibu further said the officer \"is an experienced election contractor\" with a history of \"collaborating\" with Mr. \nAudu.\n\n\"INEC Personnel Compromised\"\n\nMr. Shaibu also alleged that some personnel of the Independent National Electoral Commission had been \ncompromised by the opposition APC.\n\n\"We have uncovered acts of inducement and bribery by our challengers to compensate electoral officers,\" he said.\n\nHe said the Electoral Officer for Kogi Local Government Area, Chris Utile, on Thursday afternoon, dropped 40 \ntrained ad hoc staff for new ones brought in two buses from Benue State.\n\n\"The (new) persons in question did not go through any training whatsoever.

This can be effected by giving specific instructions to INEC officials at the voting units.\n\n\"The Situation Room especially urges the digital public to be discerning in their reading of social media reports as \nexperiences have shown that some of the reports may be replete with deliberate falsehood aimed at misleading the \npublic.\n\n\"Finally, the Situation Room calls on all stakeholders in the election process to live up to the expectation of \nNigerians and especially calls on INEC to deliver free, fair and credible elections in Kogi State.\"\n\nPolicemen were seen at the police command headquarters being deployed to their various locations for the \nelection.\n\nTrucks were overloaded with police personnel suggesting there might be serious logistical problems.\n\nMajority of them were still waiting at the command to be conveyed to their respective destinations.\n\n16.02\n\nArmy has no role in covering election - Police DIG\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police deployed to oversee security for Saturday's governorship election in Kogi \nstate, Leroy Sotonye, has said the Army would not be involved in providing security for the poll. \"They will have no \nrole in the election, unless I invite them when the law enforcement is unable to curtail the challenges, \" Mr. Sotonye \ntold journalists in Lokoja on Friday.

Few hours into the rally, hoodlums \nsuspected to be sponsored by the PDP attacked people.\"\n\nHe says the major hotspots for cult violence in the River State are Okirika, Abua/Oduah, Odogbolu, and ONELGA.\n\n17.34\n\nUgochukwu Ahiakwo, a resident of Omoku in ONELGA, is testifying.\n\nHe says he is a commercial bus driver.\n\nHe says he is an APC youth leader in the local government.\n\nHe tenders a photo of a car.\n\nMr. Odinkalu: \"You are telling us to accept a photo of a Toyota Corolla to represent a Mercedes Benz, attached in \nyour affidavit?\"\n\nMrs. Oriye apologises to the Commission and says there's been a mix-up from the Secretariat.\n\nThe Secretariat says the witness could not find the picture of the Toyota Corolla.\n\nThe witness says he had stopped work in the community since after he was attacked.\n\n16.36\n\nThe next witness, Okwudiri Ahiakwo, from Omoku in ONELGA (Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni local government area) \ncomes to testify.\n\nHe says he relocated to Owerri since November 28, 2014.\n\nHe tenders before the Commission photographs of his building and car that were shot at in November last year.\n\nHe tenders another photo of a damaged building housing an APC office and says the building belongs to him.\n\n\"I was driving the car that night. After the shooting, I managed to drive the car to the house and parked it. They shot \nat the tyre of the car, the fuel tank, and the glasses.\n\nThe Commission tells him the photographs do not show the damages done to his car and building.\n\nHe says the building belongs to his father.\n\n\"They shot the building randomly. It affected the roof. I live on the first floor and there were tenants downstairs. \nBecause of the shooting, all the tenants ran away.\"\n\nHe says he wants the Commission to help him rebuild the house.\n\nHe says the incident happened the day before the APC gubernatorial candidate, Dakuku Peterside, came for a \nrally at Omoku.\n\nThe Commission says the witness wrote in his statement that his car was \"totally ridden with bullets.\" Yet the \nwitness is struggling to point out bullet holes on his car.\n\nMr. Ahiakwo says the picture of the car was taken immediately after the shooting incident.\n\nMr. Odinkalu argues that the photograph the witness submitted about his car was not taken immediately after the \nincident. Mr. Ahiakwo reluctantly agreed, and says it was taken when he was told of the Commission's sitting.\n\n\n\n16.17\n\nThe Commission reconvenes.\n\nThe fourth witness of the day, Vincent Otto, a native of Elelenwa in Obiakpor local government area, comes to \ntestify.\n\nHe says he is \"a successful businessman\" and a politician.\n\nHe says he produces the \"largest palm oil\" in Rivers State.\n\nHe says he knows the people who demolished his property that but had not gone to court.\n\nMr. Otto's property, an hotel, was demolished during the expansion of the East-West Road.\n\nHe says the building was demolished first in 2012, he rebuilt in 2013, and demolished again in January 2014.\n\nThe Commission says they are dealing only with politically-motivated destructions.\n\nBut Mr. Otto says the demolition was a \"deliberate act.\"\n\nThe Commission and Mr. Otto having contrary views on whether his building was demolished or not.\n\nMr. Otto says he personally demolished an area marked by the Ministry of Works in 2012.\n\nHe says they were paid compensation for the demolition.\n\nThe Commission seem not to be buying Mr. Otto's claim that his demolished building was politically-motivated.\n\nThe Commission asks him to read from a document from the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nHe reads, \"Following your receipt of full payment of compensation of your property....\"\n\nMr. Odinkalu tells him to excuse the Commission since he had received full compensation for his property in 2012.\n\nMr. Otto: \"The way we are looking at it is not that way. After they marked red, everybody responded.\"\n\nHe says a GTBank and other buildings near his own were not demolished.\n\nHe says he was paid N50 million.\n\nMr. Otto insists his demolished building was political because it was singled out from other structures in the area.\n\nThe Commission advises him to file a suit at the High Court, adding that that was where to treat issue regarding a \ngovernment employee who oversteps his brief.\n\nThe witness is discharged.\n\n16.17\n\nThe Chairman calls for a 30 minute recess.\n\n16.16\n\nTestifying next is Bright Umunnakwe from Rumueprikom in Obiakpor local government area.\n\nThe witness steps out, his right arm enclosed in a plaster cast.\n\nHe says he works as a supervisor in a dredging and construction company.\n\n\n\nHe says he was a former ward chairman and currently the Chief Security Officer of APC in the local government.\n\nHe says if anything happens in the LGA, the matter would be reported to his office, and they, in turn, report to the \npolice or the local government.\n\nHe tenders photographs showing injuries he sustained during an attack - he used his arm to block a machete aimed \nat his head.\n\nHe also tenders photos of other people attacked during an APC rally.\n\nHe says one Barrister Tasie Wike was also attacked.\n\nHe shows photographs of damaged buildings and properties.\n\nMr. Umunnakwe is submitting numerous photographs of party members in the local government whose properties \nwere destroyed.\n\n\"I want to say that I've never experienced this kind of politicking in my lifetime and I hope it never happens again.\n\n\"Some of our members can no longer go home because they promised to kill them before the end of the year.\n\n\"My life is in danger and even after this Commission I don't know what will happen to me. We want the state \ngovernment to come to our aid.\"\n\nHe says a member's building was damaged because he refused to leave APC for PDP.\n\nThe Commission argues that the building in question was among those demolished during a federal government \nroad expansion and they were compensated.\n\nMr. Umunnakwe says he was not aware of that.\n\nThe Commission points out to the witness that the photograph of an incident he claimed happened on March 27th, \nthe even of the presidential election, had January 23rd inscribed on it.\n\nHe says all the incidents happened \"within the election period.\"\n\n13.47\n\nThe second witness, Awola Briggs, is testifying.\n\nHe says he is a civil servant from Akoku-Toru local government area.\n\nHe tenders a photograph of the corpse of his nephew who was killed. He also tenders a photograph of the cult \nleader who instructed his boys to kill his nephew.\n\nHe says he was not present when the cult leader gave the order.\n\n\"Why I have the confidence to say that is that he was even boasting that he did and some of my relations who \nheard it and told me.\"\n\nCounsel to the Commission, Mrs. Oriye, asks the panel to discharge the witness because most of his evidences \nwere from hearsay.\n\nThe panel turns down the request.\n\nThe witness tenders a copy of the autopsy report showing the cause of death of his nephew.\n\nHe says he wants the Commission to assist the deceased's family and bring the perpetrators to book.\n\n\n\nHe says the deceased, 25 years old, was a bricklayer.\n\nHe says the his nephew's is over 80 years old.\n\nHe says he was told his nephew was taken to a waterside and was beaten with iron rods and cutlass.\n\nHe says he belongs to the APC, and so did his late nephew.\n\nHe says the nephew's murder was politically-motivated because PDP supporters intended to kill \"staunch \nsupporters\" of APC.\n\n13.44\n\nMr. Jack says the cult groups were hired by the PDP as thugs.\n\n\"If you were in Abonema that day, everybody was running for their dear lives.\"\n\nHe says his party stands for 'change' and will not hire a cult group.\n\nThe Commission is pressing the council boss to explain the meaning of 'boys' in his statement.\n\nMr. Jack, obviously reluctant to continue the discussion of the cult groups, responds: \"This memorandum was \nprepared by a team. I sit here as council chairman and head of security. I may not be disposed to some of the \nthings mentioned.\"\n\nMr. Odinkalu: \"Mr. Chairman, who is a boy?\"\n\nMr. Jack: \"In a political scenario, they call 'boys.' It can be people in a political party. That's what they call 'boys.\"\n\nHe says it's possible for cult groups to co-habit even within one political party.\n\nHe says the cultists live among the people in his local government.\n\nHe says he would not want to say if the people in the community know the cultists and where they live.\n\nHe says Governor Amaechi was able to curtail the activities of the cult groups.\n\nHe says creating jobs for the youth would take them away from cult activities.\n\nHe says he is a \"believer\" with \"faith in God\" and, therefore, does not have 'boys.'\n\nHe says after the attack on the DPO at the polling station, Mr. Kayode, he was taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\n13.01\n\nMr. Jack says the attacks were reported to the police but they did not act. \"And that's why we are here.\"\n\nHe says the attacked member was taken to Abonema General Hospital for treatment.\n\nHe asks the Commission to investigate the attacks and to recommend solution to a lasting peace in Akoku-Toru \nlocal government.\n\nHe says the attackers also boasted by saying that Dr. Danagogo (Minister of Sports), Roland Sekibo, and others \nwere their sponsors\n\n\"In my capacity as the leader of the party (APC) in my local government, all these things were reported to me,\" \nsays Mr. Jack.\n\n\"And as council chairman, I witnessed some of these acts.\n\n\n\n\"Before the election, we uncovered a plot by the PDP to consistently use the police to intimidate and arrest staunch \nmembers of the APC and detain them before the election on trumped up charges.\"\n\nMr. Jack says those arrested, including Diepriye Briggs and Christian Don-Pedro, were released \"immediately \nafter\" the election.\n\nHe says the arrests on trumped-up charges was a state-wide incident.\n\nHe says the Commissioner for Urban Development and the DPO of Abonema (who was escorting him) were \nbeaten up at the polling unit.\n\nHe says the previous DPO was changed at around midnight and so the attackers did not know he was the DPO.\n\n\"They thought the DPO was escorting the Commissioner as his aide, they didn't know he was the DPO.\"\n\nHe says he doesn't have the \"statistics\" as to the number of non-APC members who also suffered violence during \nthe election.\n\n\"From my observation as someone who was present in my local government, it is not possible that a member of \nany other party suffered violence.\"\n\nHe says before the election, he set up a curfew where security forces were supposed to take charge but they \nrefused to enforce it.\n\nThe Commission is grilling Mr. Jack on why he's testifying as the leader of the APC in his local government and not \nas the leader of the entire local government.\n\nMr. Odinkalu, the Chairman of the Commission, tells him: \"You are not the leader of APC local government. You \nare the leader of all the parties in Akoku-Toru.\"\n\nMr. Jack defends his actions by insisting that he had always played a neutral role in discharging his duties in the \ncouncil.\n\n\"Before the election, like I said, what I did was to seek for a curfew in order to protect everybody.\"\n\nHe says he needs to consult his Chief Security Officer to know the names of the cult groups in his local \ngovernment.\n\nHe then says there are Icelanders, Greenlanders, Deewell, Deebam.\n\nHe says the cult group had been in existence for over five years.\n\n12.28\n\nThe first witness today is Fenibo Jack from Abonema in Akuku-Toru local government area.\n\nHe says he is the Executive Chairman of the local government.\n\nHe says there were destruction of their billboards and attacks on their party properties and offices.\n\nThe witness is taking a lot of time sorting out photographs of the destroyed properties and offices and injured \nmembers of his party, the All Progressives Congress.\n\n18.43\n\nAnother witness, Ezekiel Nte, comes out to testify.\n\n\n\nHe says he wants the Commission to mandate the police to come to their aid because they were thoroughly beaten \nup.\n\nHe asks for a compensation of N4 million.\n\nHe says he knows one of the people who attacked him because he demanded for the election result sheet.\n\nMr. Nte is the last witness for today.\n\nMr. Odinkalu adjourns the hearing to Saturday for the Commission to entertain group petitions.\n\n18.34\n\nThe next witness, Uzodinma Silas, a resident of Andoni, is testifying.\n\nHe tenders photographs of injuries sustained during the election.\n\n\"I want the Commission to bring those who inflicted the injuries on me to book. I also want the Commission to liaise \nwith the government to compensate me.\"\n\nHe says his attackers were not from his community and he did not recognise any of them.\n\n\"I reported to the police but the policeman I saw on the counter was on mufti. He asked me to narrate what \nhappened and I did. Then he told me to pay N30,000 for them to follow up the case. So I left\"\n\nHe says he had not had a police case in the past but knows he was not supposed to pay any money.\n\nHe says he was not a party agent on March 28th but worked as one on April 11th, the day he was attacked.\n\n\"Some boys came in that morning and were chanting 'No PDP, no election. No Nyesom Wike, no election.' \nEverybody ran away including the people that wanted to vote.\"\n\nHe says he was not aware if election eventually held that day because he was \"totally down.\"\n\n\"As I speak to you, I'm no longer receiving treatment but I'm still feeling pains because I was hit on the chest. A \nfriend advised me to go for x-ray but I don't have money.\"\n\nHe says he had reported to his party but nothing had been done to assist him.\n\nHe says he sells wears and can no longer go out for his business because he can't stand under the sun and \ncoughs out blood sometimes.\n\nThe Commission advises him to obtain a doctor's report explaining the amount of disability he is suffering.\n\n18.19\n\nFelix Ejechi, a resident of Omoku in ONELGA, comes out to testify.\n\nHe says he is from Ndoni town.\n\nHe says APC offices in the local governments were attacked on January 29th, April 12th, and April 13th.\n\n\"We were going to host the APC governorship candidate, Dakuku Peterside, for a rally in ONELGA. In the early \nhour of 29th, that was when they did all these damages. For three hours (between midnight and 3 a.m.) they were \nmoving all round and police were there.\"\n\n\"I confronted the DPO on why they would allow those boys three hours to be destroying things and he told me the \nfire was too much and he had to take cover.\" He accuses one Uche Jeremiah of spearheading the April 13th attack.\n\n\n\nHe says they didn't retaliate and but adds that \"it is unlawful to be lawful in a lawless environment.\"\n\n\"If the security agents in ONELGA are invited, they will tell you that the APC never took laws into their hands.\"\n\nHe says they wrote to the State Police Commissioner for protection \"else they would resort to self-help.\"\n\nHe says though their letter did not get a response from the police, they still didn't resort to self-help.\n\nHe says he joined the PDP in 1998 and served two tenures as Councillor. In 2008, he was elected Chairman of \nONELGA, and was re-elected again before the APC/PDP split.\n\nHe says Felix Obuah was Chairman of ONELGA while he was a councillor.\n\n\"The way forward is simple. All these perpetrators of violence must be brought to book. The police should no longer \nside one side. They refuse to do their work. I was told the DPO said he was posted there to work for PDP.\"\n\nHe says he left ONELGA \"completely\" since January.\n\n18.18\n\nThe next witness, Ijeoma Mbamalu, comes out to testify.\n\nShe's carrying a little child - 11 months old.\n\nShe says she's a housewife and lived with her husband at Oprikom.\n\nShe says her husband was shot death.\n\n\"I ask for you people's help. That very day he wanted to go market before those boys come. The N100,000 he left, \nthey took it away. As I told you, I don't have anything I'm doing. And my husband left me with a baby.\"\n\nShe says her husband is from Ozubulu in Anambra State.\n\n\"They took my baby that very night and throw him on the bed and told me to lie down\n\n\"They asked my husband to take them where the landlord lives and all the APC members in the compound. My \nhusband said he doesn't know the landlord and he pays his rent through his lawyer. At this point they got angry and \ntook my baby from me and threw him on the floor and told me to lie down.\n\n\"They took my husband outside and shot him three times.\"\n\nShe says her husband was a mechanic.\n\nShe says they heard shouts of 'kidnappers' outside but before\n\n\"They asked the party we belong and my husband said we don't belong to any party. They started searching the \nhouse maybe to look for any APC evidence. It was then they saw the money my husband wanted to take to \nmarket.\"\n\nShe says her husband would be 28 on August 25th and she'll be 21 in June.\n\n\"This year will make it four years we have been living in Oprikom. But we married in September 2013.\"\n\nShe says her mother is dead and her father is \"very old.\"\n\nShe breaks down and weeps.\n\nThe Commission apologises.\n\n\n\nShe says she is not aware if anyone was arrested after the incident.\n\nShe says her husband had been buried last Friday in his hometown in Ozubulu.\n\n\"His people came that very day and took him.\"\n\n18.12\n\nThe younger Mr. Poroma returns for his testimony.\n\nHe continues his explanation of the attack at his father's house when he hid beneath his car to watch.\n\n\"I wish the Commission to investigate and punish those who did these acts with a view to bringing an end to the \nviolence in my community.\"\n\nAnother witness, Promise Amadi, is supported by clutches as he limps out to testify.\n\nHe says he resides in Elioparamuo in Obiakpor local government area.\n\n(Photo of Mr. Amadi giving his testimony)\n\n17.46\n\nThe next witness, Christian Alali, comes out to testify.\n\nHe says he lives in ONELGA and is a student of the National Open University of Nigeria.\n\nHe says he wants the Commission to assist him in rebuilding his destroyed building and that it would cost N5 \nmillion.\n\nHe says the building, which was burnt by hoodlums, was completed in 2000 and it housed 18 people.\n\nThe witness apologises and says he underestimated the cost of the damaged building.\n\nHe says it's now \"N20 million and above.\"\n\nHe says all his tenants had left after the attack and the building is now empty.\n\nHe says he is a member of the APC.\n\nThe Commission says it's not \"practicable\" to spend N20 million to rebuild one room.\n\nHe says his dad is late and had willed the property to him.\n\n17.31\n\nMr. Amadi, a welder, says he took to his heels when he heard gunshots while fixing a canopy.\n\n\"I saw PDP boys shooting, so I turned and they said 'Yellow man, you again!' They shot me and I ran to the \nbackyard where I jumped the fence and fractured my leg.\"\n\nHe says APC are not liked in his community.\n\n\"I don't know any of them but they are PDP boys because some of them were telling me to remove that canopy.\"\n\nHe says it was his town boys that told him PDP thugs shot him.\n\nHe says more than three herbalists have tried to set the fractured leg, and that they had already extracted the \nbullet.\n\n\n\n\"I've spent up to 500 to 600,000 because after they removed the bullet, they still cannot set the leg well.\n\n\"I've sent messages to my party (APC) but no one has come for me.\"\n\nHe says currently things are quiet in his community because elections are over.\n\nHe says he's now finding it difficult to pay his children's school fees and asks for financial assistance.\n\n17.18\n\nThe next witness, David Akio, from Abua/Oduah local government, is testifying.\n\nHe says his Mercedes car was destroyed by hoodlums.\n\nHe says he was beaten up and chased out of the local government by the thugs led by a Special Assistant to the \nRivers State governor-elect.\n\n\"On that 27th of March, I was attacked in my father's compound. I don't know how my opponents monitored me and \nknow I was in the community.\n\n\"I went into hiding and was smuggled out of the community on the 29th.\"\n\nMr. Akio, 44, says he returned to the community on the night before April 11th because he was a contestant for the \nHouse of Assembly election.\n\n\"After the 28th, most of the people that were chased out of the community returned. I was communicating with \nthem and they said it's like things have cooled down.\"\n\nHe says after the second attack on the night he returned, he went to hide in the bush until the police rescued him.\n\nHe says he joined PDP in 1998 and had served as a Councillor under the party.\n\nHe says the violence in the local government before the election was not really political, but as a result of \nchieftaincy tussle.\n\nHe says the cult wars in the local government were \"well separated\" from political killings. He says the PDP uses \nthe cult group and is not aware if APC also uses them.\n\nHe says the two popular cults in the local government are Icelanders and Greenlanders. \"For the purpose of this \nelection, both groups worked for one particular party.\"\n\nHe says the Greenlanders are headed by a member of the House of Assembly and both groups were \"very active\" \nduring the election\n\n16.01\n\nThe Commission reconvenes.\n\nMr. Poroma is recalled to tender a photocopy of the autopsy report of the man who was shot at his home.\n\nThe fourth witness for the day, Stephen Poroma, comes to give evidence.\n\nHe says he is a civil servant.\n\nHe says he was an eye witness to the incident at the Commissioner's home.\n\nHe says he heard the hoodlums shouting 'Where is the Commissioner? Where is the Commissioner?' And that if \nthey had found him, they would have shot him.\n\n\n\nThe younger Poroma, 38, says he hid under the Hilux van in the compound and was able to identify all those \ninvolved in the attack.\n\n\"The vehicle was parked on the right hand side of my father's main building. They came from the left hand side, so \nwhen they came, I hid under the car because that was not their target.\"\n\nThere are issues with the witness's photographic evidence and the Chairman asks the witness to step down and \nsort them out.\n\n14.50\n\nAnother witness, Austin Ahiamadu, steps out to testify.\n\nMr. Ahiamadu, the Chairman of ONELGA (Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni local government) tenders photographs of \ndestroyed APC offices in the local government.\n\nHe says as the chief security officer of the local government, he swore an oathe to protect the lives and properties \nof people in the local government.\n\nHe alleges that Felix Obuah, who is the state PDP Chairman, is responsible for the destruction of the properties.\n\nHe says that before he assumed office as Chairman in 2013, there were lots of violence and atrocities in ONELGA.\n\n\"The first step we took was to arrange a training, because unemployment became problem. ONELGA is the like the \nhub of oil and gas.\n\nHe says 52 youth were sent for training on welding, sewing, and so on. He also organised a peace concert in the \ncouncil.\n\nHe says after Mr. Obuah won a court order as PDP Chairman, he began to flout his orders in the local government.\n\n\"We had a curfew from 6 in the evening that motorcycles should not be working. Because that's what they usually \nuse for crime. Mr. Obuah came and gave instructions to the cyclists that they should operate beyond the curfew.\"\n\nHe says when they saw that the problem was too much, they sought the advice of traditional rulers.\n\nMr. Ahiamadu says the solution for the violence is for institutions to be strengthened and be alive to their \nresponsibilities.\n\nHe says his government seeks his justice.\n\nThe Chairman calls for a 30 minutes recess.\n\n14.49\n\nThe second witness, Innocent Ogbuehi, comes out to testify.\n\nHe says he lives in Emohua local government and he worked as an electrical engineer before he was stopped by \nmilitants.\n\nHe says he wants the Commission to help him bury his 59 year old brother who was killed on election day.\n\nHe says his late brother was married with five children - oldest is 25 and youngest is seven years old. He says his \nbrother was a farmer.\n\nHe says he reported to the police and they sent an Inspector to go with him to the crime scene.\n\n\n\nHe says the police Inspector was told to handover the matter and all the evidence to the State CID \"and since then \nwe have not heard anything from them.\"\n\nHe says his brother was shot while he was shaving in front of his house on the day of the gubernatorial election.\n\nMr. Ogbuehi says his brother was a strong member of the APC.\n\nHe says one Friday Ogbuehi led the attack and that the Mr. Friday is a member of their family.\n\n\"We have a pending land case in our family before the king.\"\n\nHe says Mr. Friday, 35, is his cousin.\n\nThe witness says he is now shouldering the responsibility of taking care of his brother's widow and children.\n\n\"On the 8th of April, he (Mr. Friday) came out to make a comment that the three boys who will kill my brother are in \nhis phone.\"\n\nHe says he needs money for an autopsy because the money the police asked him to bring \"is too much for me.\"\n\nHe says he also needs money for the upkeep of his late brother's family.\n\n13.44\n\nMr. Poroma says the shooters were in their early twenties and \"these are my boys who cannot afford one square \nmeal. So how are the able to afford bullets?\"\n\nHe says he had never had any dealings in the past with those boys, even when he was in the PDP.\n\nHe says in 2008 when he came into governance he tried hard to resolve the differences between the paramount \nruler of his community and Monday Ngbor leading to the former being kidnapped.\n\n\"What triggered the recent violence in my community is as a result of a political leader who is trying to tell people in \nPort Harcourt that he is on ground and is able to deliver the community and even the local government.\"\n\nHe says the violence has festered because people don't get punished when they commit a crime.\n\n\"My hope is that there is a need for us to arrest the situation whereby the police will do what they are supposed to \ndo.\"\n\nThe Chairman tells Mr. Poroma to go and provide documents he had promised to tender before the Commission.\n\n13.28\n\nHe says \"not less than\" ten girls are raped every day in the state mostly by gangs.\n\nHe says the rape cases are not really political.\n\nHe says the man (Mr. Lekia) who was shot to death at his home had not been buried.\n\n\"The shooting took place around 6 a.m, even before the election took place. The police did not show up until about \n2:30 p.m. So the body was right there in my house.\n\n\"At the time the incident took place, I called the DPO and he said he had been transferred. This thing happened in \nthe morning, he was transferred in the evening.\n\n\"I now sent someone to go and report to the station because I did not have the number of the new DPO. The DCO \ndid not come until 2:30 p.m.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Poroma says he lived abroad and only returned to Nigeria when Governor Amaechi entered office.\n\nHe says there were no INEC presence in his community on the two election days but results were declared.\n\nHe says the shooting started weeks before the election.\n\n\"I went to the king, we met with the DPO and a joint meeting was called between the APC and PDP leadership and \nwe were made to sign a peace accord. To be responsible for any violence caused by any of our groups.\n\n\"Not quite three days afterwards, there were gun shots all over the community. Unfortunately, it's a community \nwhere young boys carry guns.\"\n\nHe says on March 27th, there was a meeting at his home and they agreed that party agents should report to his \nhouse early Saturday morning to collect their tags before moving to their respective polling units.\n\nHe describes as unfortunate the failure of the police to respond immediately ro his distress call, and says the \nshooting at his home lasted for over 30 minutes and it was \"the most terrifying moment\" of his life. \"I was trying to \ncall any number I can remember.\"\n\n13.07\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry opens with the Chairman, Chidi Odinkalu, apologising for starting late. He says the \nprivate hearing \"took longer than expected.\"\n\nThe first witness, Joe Poroma, steps out to testify.\n\nHe says he's the Commissioner for Social Welfare and Rehabilitation in Rivers State\n\nHe tenders photographs, including that of one Mr. Lekia who was shot in the neck in his home.\n\n\"The bullet went through his neck and shattered the window,\" he says.\n\nHe says he is seeking justice for the young man \"that was cut short.\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate that on the day that this incident took place, it was precisely by 6p.m. I'm the leader of the APC in \nmy ward.\n\n\"I want a proper investigation because that has not been done till now.\"\n\nHe says the gunmen also shot at his Hilux van and generator in his home and damaged them.\n\n\"Over 22 houses in the community were destroyed on that same day. They went through houses belonging to APC \nmembers, shatter your window, break your door.\n\n\"When the police came to arrest them, the trigger man was arrested, and unfortunately they outnumbered the police \nand the police abandoned them even the ones they handcuffed and ran away.\n\n\"They mobilised in so many numbers and the police were afraid and ran away.\"\n\nHe says the matter was reported to the police on March 28th, the say of the incident.\n\nHe says some of the hoodlums were ex-militants and \"they have always been above the law. Unfortunately we \nhave the untouchables and they are one of the untouchables.\"\n\nHe proceeds to name the name of the ex-militants: Monday Ngbor (the financier), Johnny Ngbor, Mwine Sunday \n(the trigger man),\n\nHe says Monday Ngbor is the leader of the PDP in his local government.\n\n\n\nHe says he was also in PDP before he was expelled three years ago.\n\nHe says the gang members call themselves 'Chief Monday Ngbor's Boys.'\n\nMr. Poroma says he doesn't have 'boys' but 'brothers.'\n\n13.01\n\nThe Commission have spent the past one and a half hour listening to testimonies 'in-camera' from four witnesses \non allegations of assault and kidnapping.\n\nThe media were asked not to cover that proceedings for the safety of the witnesses.\n\n15.17\n\nThe Chairman of the Commission, Chidi Odinkalu, adjourns proceedings, says it would continue in Port Harcourt \non Friday.\n\nThanks for following our live updates. See you on Friday.\n\n15.13\n\nThe third witness, Thankgod Igwe, comes to testify.\n\nHe says he is into \"cleaning services.\"\n\nMr. Igwe, 38, says he was an APC party agent at his polling unit in Agbonchia during the presidential election\n\n\"On that very day, I discovered there is no result sheet when we started accrediting. As an agent, I have to ask \nabout the result sheet, if there is no result sheet we don't know how this election will go.\n\n\"As an agent I said this election will not commence because there is no result sheet. There was a lot of argument \nbetween the PDP people and I\n\nHe says he identified some of the PDP boys as Ngoya Omere and Friday Ejire.\n\n\"We were there exchanging words. They said election must hold. There was a fight. They beat me up and blind my \neyes. As you can see, my eyes is blind.\n\n\"Osarogo Oluji bring out something from his pocket and hit me on my eyes.\n\nHe says the police at the polling unit ran away as he screamed for help.\n\n\"There was no movement that day. Everybody started running. One of my brother ran to their house, brought a bike \nand carry me to a clinic. The clinic rejected me and directed me to one of the clinics at Elelenwa. They rejected me \nagain. They now took me BMH. They kept me there 3-4 days before they moved me to surgery department.\n\n\"They said because my bp was high, they cannot take me to the theatre. After three days, they controlled my bp \nand took me to the theatre.\"\n\nHe says he was hospitalised from March 28th to April 10th. And that he did not participate in the governorship \nelection.\n\nHe says he spent N200,000 on medical bills.\n\nHe says he is married with two children.\n\n15.13\n\n\n\nMr. Olaka says as a youth leader, he uses \"little stipends\" sent from the palace to assist some of the youth.\n\n\"There is a way we are doing this batch by batch. The money comes from personal struggle and from well-wishers. \nAnd surveillance job for Shell.\"\n\nHe denies that the violence in the community had anything to do with contracts from Shell, and says his youth \npresidency elapses in August\n\nHe defines a youth as someone \"from one to 50.\"\n\n13.38\n\nThe next witness, Walter Olaka, steps out to testify.\n\nHe says he is into community peace-keeping and currently the youth president of Ogale community.\n\nHe says he is a member of the APC.\n\n\"On the 28th of March, while I was at Unit 2, there was this complaint that since the result sheet is not available, \nsome group of PDP members want to force pressure on voters to commence voting.\n\n\"I went there with the peace-keeping team and saw that they were actually demanding for result sheet. While I was \nstill there, some PDP people came towards us.\n\n\"I heard one making a call saying that the youth president is here. After that phone call, not up to 30 minutes, we \nsaw about three Hilux coming towards the market street with full headlight.\n\n\"When those people came out, first thing they did was they started shooting. We actually moved back. Since they \ndidn't make harm in their shooting, we now went closer.\n\nHe says when they were moving closer, a soldier opened fire on them, shooting one Chris Nneji who was beside \nhim.\n\n\"Initially when we ran away, those boys that made call moved closer to the hilux and were discussing with them.\"\n\n\"The person that was in that Hilux was Honourable Olaka Nwogu. I called the police that we just wanted to ask for \nresult sheet and this is our experience.\"\n\nHe says after Chris was shot, he informed Inside Eleme, a newspaper, the DPO of Eleme, and the paramount ruler \nabout the incident.\n\n\"The DPO sent Inspector Monday to the place. He told me he would be going back to the DPO to give him the \nreport.\n\n\"What the police did was the DPO came in a Hilux and carried the deceased to Last Home mortuary. The corpse is \nstill in the mortuary.\"\n\nHe says on April 16th, he was at home when a crowd of people came. \"My sister and brother escaped gunshots. \nThey were asking 'where is Presido?' They damaged the house windows.\"\n\nHe says they came the day Nyesom Wike was announced as winner of the governorship election.\n\nHe tenders photographs of damaged of his house, adding that they took away two motorcycles.\n\nHe says he knows Olaka Nwogu as a one time Chairman of Eleme local government.\n\n\"I know that anytime he comes into a contest, there must be a serious contest, by using intimidation and shooting of \ngun. That has been his style.\n\n\n\n\"In 2002, when he was in the House of Reps, I know he brought out a style by using J.O Nwogu who went around \nburning peoples' houses. Olaka has so much influence on military men.\n\nHe says J.O was the Eleme youth leader at the time.\n\n\"The police are with them that you don't have any room for questioning.\"\n\nHe says there has always been violence during elections in Eleme.\n\nHe says he would appreciate if the Commission can investigate the issues in Eleme and bring perpetrators to \njustice.\n\n\"Because of what happened, there was no election in Ogale.\"\n\n12.43\n\nLoveday Obare, Counsel to Eleme local government area, says he would call three witnesses\n\nThe first witness, Marcus Tetenwi, says he resides in Alesa-Eleme. He says he is the Chief Protocol Officer of \nEleme local government area.\n\nHe says he is a member of the APC.\n\nHe says that on March 28th, there was a controversy as to the result sheets and moments later, three Hilux vans \ndrove into the area with soldiers and one Olaka Nwogu, who was inside one of the the vehicles, pointed at him.\n\nHe says he quickly ran to his home, wanted to use his car, thought against it, and ran away; returning later to see \nthat the soldiers who had followed him riddled the vehicle with bullets. He says he called a photographer and \njournalists to cover the incident.\n\nHe says he heard several gunshots from where he was hiding.\n\nHe tenders before the Commission a photo of his vehicle after the gunshots\n\n\"That very day, they (Mr. Nwogu and armed men) actually took over the whole scenario with military men by \nintimidating and harassing people.\n\n\"They were chasing me because I was demanding for the result sheet.\"\n\nHe says Mr. Nwogu have \"evil antecedents\" in Alesa-Eleme community.\n\n\"I was hiding inside my house when they were shooting at my vehicle. My mum and other women came out \nshouting 'do you want to kill him like you have been killing others.' I think that made him to relent and they went \naway.\"\n\nHe says a lot of persons were also demanding to see the result sheet on that election day.\n\n\"They wanted to commence the election in the absence of the result sheet, but I insisted that if there was no result \nsheet there would be no election day.\"\n\nHe says the polling unit is about 300 metres from his home. He says his assailants were wearing military uniforms \nbut he does not if they were actual soldiers.\n\nHe says he only complained to his party and not the police. \"Because during that election, some of us were scared \nbecause there is conspiracy between the police and the military men to work with Olaka Nwogu.\"\n\nHe says Mr. Nwogu belongs to the PDP.\n\n\n\nHe says he became Chief Protocol Officer in 2008 and was not a member of a political party at the time. He says \nhe joined the APC in 2013.\n\nHe says he doesn't know if there were cult groups in Eleme.\n\n\"Olaka Nwogu should be questioned because there is no time he is vying for position that violence that does not \nhappen. He has a lot of pending cases all over the place.\"\n\n20.20\n\nMr. Ogbuagu says guns had never been used in ONELGA before 2015.\n\n\"We have never recorded any murder during or after election.\"\n\nHe says the two chiefs that were murdered during the election - one in his early 70's, the other late 60's - could not \nhave been members of cult groups.\n\n\"Even though we have suffered all that we have suffered, our joy today is that APC is not dead in Nigeria.\"\n\nHe says he does not have any \"boys,\" as a devoted Christian and a member of the First Baptist Church.\n\n\"I have not had any case in ONELGA where they said these boys belong to Honourable Ogbuagu and are involved \nin cult activities. I only have APC supporters.\"\n\nHe insists there was no thuggery when the APC members were all in PDP.\n\nHe asks the Commission to assist the victims of the violence. \"Today I don't have a place. All I worked for as leader \nof Council for two consecutive times, as Secretary of Council, as Member of Council at Federal Technical Education \nhas gone. The government should come to my aid. I have a very big family and I need to make a home for them.\n\n\"Presently, I have relocated my family to Abuja.\n\n\"My house that was destroyed is valued at not less than N15 million. My house is a five bedroom bungalow with two \nparlours. If you value the materials in my house, not less than N10 million, my wife's expensive clothes - I invested \nheavily in my wife, my six children.\n\n\"My wife was kidnapped in December last year. That's why I moved my family to Abuja.\"\n\nThe Chairman announces the end of the day's sitting.\n\nAnother on-the-sight visit is slated for Thursday and sitting resumes on Friday.\n\n20.03\n\nThe Chairman apologises that they can't take everyone today and calls for the last witness - for today - to testify.\n\nChijioke Ogbuagu, a resident of Omoku in ONELGA, comes out to testify.\n\nHe describes himself as a politician and contested the last election under APC for the State House of Assembly \nONELGA Constituency 2.\n\nHe tenders photographs of his burnt house and two vehicles - a Kia Rio and a Honda Element. One photograph \nshows the corpse of one of his relatives who died after his house was \"dynamited.\"\n\nOther photographs show the burnt houses of his elder brother and a dead body of Sampson Ezekiel, a security \nman.\n\nAnother photograph shows a young man \"murdered\" at the APC office in the village.\n\n\n\nHe says nine people were killed in one day - on April 3rd (Good Friday).\n\n\"The killing started at Obrigom at late Chief C.N Adube's house, my political mentor. They finished from there and \nwent to the APC office at Obrigom where they killed the boy. From there they moved to my community.\"\n\nHe says he was in Port Harcourt at the time.\n\n\"People saw them. It was not a hidden something.\"\n\n\"In Obrigom they killed seven persons. In Chief Adube's house, they killed six - Adugbue, three of his children, his \nsecurity person...\n\n\"Two were killed in my premises. The one that was burnt to ashes, the bone has been gathered and buried. The \nSampson Ezekiel was buried too, his body was taken from Nassarawa State because he's from there.\"\n\nHe says the violence in ONELGA began after the judgment that gave the PDP chairmanship in the state to Felix \nObuah.\n\nHe accuses Mr. Obuah of sponsoring thugs to unleash the violence in their local government.\n\n\"As I talk to you, my supporters are no longer living in their homes. All of them have fled. Because the lives of APC \nmembers are not safe.\"\n\nHe says the police does not listen to APC members and that the DPO in his Omoku community is a PDP card-\ncarrying member.\n\nMr. Ogbuagu says himself and Mr. Obuah were in good terms when they were both in PDP but fell out after the \ncreation of the APC.\n\n\"They came out with a slogan: If you hear anybody shouting for change, stone him to death.\"\n\nHe says the way forward is that government must restore confidence that the people and their lives and properties \nmust be protected.\n\n\"This operation that took place on the 3rd lasted for over three hours. In my house they said why they were not \nable to save anything was because the people set the house on fire and supervised the burning.\n\n\"The Commission should help us to ensure that the people who committed these violence would not go \nunpunished. ONELGA used to be a very sweet place that we enjoy 24 hours free light from Agip facility.\"\n\nHe says the \"criminal issues\" in Omoku have worsened in recent times.\n\n17.43\n\nThe fifth witness, Suleiman Akany, a resident of Odaga-Abua, steps out to testify. He says he is a businessman \nand the Vice Chairman of APC in Abua-Odual local government. He says he was the APC Collation Agent for \nWard 3 in his community on April 11th. He says he was beaten up for insisting to see the result sheet and the \nN270,000 he put in his bag was taken away. Mr. Akari says the police officers present were telling him to \"shut up, \nthat am I INEC?\" He says he was rescued by his party members. He says the money in his bag was meant for the \nfeeding of his family and that he didn't intend to share it at the polling unit because \"everybody there is PDP.\" He \nsays he had reported all the 30 people who attacked him to the police but they didn't do anything. \"The police \narrested one of the boys and released him the same day after Henry Ogini, a Director in NDDC, visited the DPO.\" \nHe says there are two cult groups in Abua, Greenlanders and Icelanders, existing during the days of militancy in \nthe Niger Delta.\n\n16.40\n\n\n\nThe proceeding reconvenes with another witness, Akoghe Caleb-Ahmed, a Civil Defence officer and a native of \nEmoh in Abua/Odual local government, comes to testify.\n\nShe says her late husband, a businessman, was 40 years.\n\nShe says she has four children - 11, 8, 4, and 2 year olds - and all of them are in school.\n\nShe says the incident happened in her presence.\n\n\"I was pleading with the people, that I don't want to be a young widow. They said my husband is an APC member. I \nsaid 'please please, he will not do again.' Before I can finish they have shoot him down in the room.\n\n\"They finished and ran away. I call the police. He died on the way to the hospital. He was buried the next day.\"\n\nShe says she paid money to the police to retrieve her husband's corpse for burial.\n\n\"I'm afraid for my life because what I see that day was terrible. I don't recognise their faces but they were not \nwearing masks. They were just wearing face caps.\n\n\"One spoke Abua language. But the ones that came inside spoke English, that 'I think you are APC member.' I was \nshouting but everybody had run away.\"\n\nShe says the incident happened three weeks before the election.\n\nShe says she doesn't know if her husband occupies an official position in the APC.\n\nShe says she still works at the Abua Division of NSCDC.\n\n\"The first attack was on my husband. The other APC members in the community ran away, up till now some of \nthem have not returned.\"\n\nMrs. Caleb-Ahmed says she wants a compensation of N20 million.\n\n15.15\n\nMr. Wokocha says they had even written to the Inspector-General of Police on the activities of Ejima but nothing \nhas happened.\n\nHe says firearms are easily accessible in the Niger Delta such as Ak-47, machine guns that stand on tripods, \nbazookas, and RPGs.\n\nHe says ONELGA was nearly as bad as it is in 2007 but the combined force of the Army, Navy, and Airforce \nbrought sanity. And that since the state governor and the federal government had a falling out, the situation had \nbecome worse that in 2007.\n\n\"There is serious social dislocation in the local government as we speak.\"\n\nThe Chairman of the panel calls for a 25 minutes recess.\n\n15.13\n\nMr. Wokocha says the APC did not deploy any of the cult groups to work for the party.\n\n\"When the situation of continuous violence erupted in the community, we tried to dissuade the youth. They said the \nproblem was nobody was taking care of them.\"\n\nHe says they tried to intervene by giving the youth N5,000 monthly to support them, and that there is a high level of \nunemployment in the community.\n\n\n\nHe says he heard from Agip \"unofficially\" that the Ejima runs a surveillance contract for them after he had \nthreatened to continue using dynamite to blow up their pipelines.\n\nHe says the damage done to his house would cost N5 million to be repaired.\n\nHe says the peace - or lack of peace - in the local government is in the hands of the state PDP Chairman and that \nif he tells his gang to sheath their swords, there will be peace.\n\n\"The first thing I think ought to be done is for the police to live up to their responsibilities. If the people who are \ncommitting these crimes are brought to book, it will act as a deterrent.\n\n\"But if they keep getting away with it, people are forced to defer to them. About a week ago, emissaries were sent \nfrom my community chief to the Ejima for peace to be in the community. He told them they would have to pay for \npeace to be in the community.\n\n\"From what I gather, the community raised N1 million and sent to him. To me that is not a solution because the \nmoney will run out.\"\n\nMr. Wokocha says the monarchy should steer away from partisan politics.\n\n\"We have a very revered traditional ruler but it is difficult for him to be taking seriously because his children are \ninvolved in politics.\"\n\nHe says the hoodlums usually come in broad daylight in military fatigue, bare-footed, and unmasked.\n\n\"When they were marching to my house, people from the community called me. I quickly called the JTF \nCommander who told me he was on his way to Port Harcourt. I called the DPO who also told me he was on his \nway to Port Harcourt.\n\n\"But after the attack they found their way to my house to count the bullets the hoodlums expended.\"\n\n14.59\n\nThe second witness, Augustine Wokocha, steps out to give evidence.\n\nHe says he is a civil servant in the state Ministry of Power.\n\nHe tenders photographs of \"burnt down\" houses of his house in the village, his chapel, and that of his Special \nAssistant.\n\nHe says he could not travel to the village immediately after the incident because there were several threats to his \nlife.\n\nHe says a \"PDP warlord\" unleashed mayhem on APC members on March 22nd. He says Ejima Charles Ifedibia \ncalled him several times to tell him to join PDP or he'll \"make life miserable for me.\"\n\nSomebody whose actions had resulted in a number of deaths of APC members on behalf of the PDP\n\nHe says the PDP gubernatorial candidate gave his community N8 million purportedly to renovate the town hall, but \nthat the money was meant Ejima's actions.\n\nHe says he was not present during the attacks but got feedbacks from the community.\n\n\"The attackers marched to my house chanting 'PDP power. No more APC.' Ejima says if we do not come to PDP \nwe will continue to suffer this violence.\"\n\nHe says he invited the JTF (one Captain Bala) and the police and they confirmed to him that it was the Ejima who \ncarried out the action.\n\n\n\n\"The only time he (Ejima) was ever arrested was when my mother was killed in cold blood in 2010. He came out \nfrom that detention and since then he had never been arrested.\"\n\nMr. Wokocha, who is the Commissioner for Power, says he had lost confidence in the police in the state.\n\nHe says the major problem between the PDP and APC in Omoku is because the former had vowed that the latter \nwill never exist in the community.\n\nHe says all the people who were listed as part of those who attacked his house have not been arrested by the \npolice.\n\nHe says he joined the APC in 2013.\n\nHe says the Ejima was not involved in politics hitherto and is a known criminal.\n\n\"After my mother was murdered, we arrested a number of people including this person. But he was not a suspect.\"\n\nHe says he believes his mother, Lucy, 67, who was kidnapped in 2010 was killed because of \"a commercial \ntransaction gone wrong.\"\n\nHe says four people were killed by the attackers and, as a result of that, many people fled from the community.\n\n\"My community is deserted actually. Obosi community. Since the last two weeks, not less than five other persons \nhave been killed.\n\n\"A man, Odiwe Orije, was shot on his back, his wife, and their son was killed.\"\n\nFrom the ongoing violence in my community, I can't say it's completely political. The feedback I get from the police \nis that it is inter and intra cult activities.\n\nWhat the police have done in all of these instant is to go and recover corpse. They have not confronted the cults.\n\nHe says the cults in his community include Deebam, Deewell, Sailors, Vikings and that they had been existing well \nbefore the 2015 elections.\n\n\"The violence prior to the elections were political, that I can say for certain. The violence after the election is the \nresult of criminal activities.\"\n\nHe says every time they go to report incidents to the police, they are detained at the station.\n\n\"When a chief was attacked the first time by one hoodlum called Chi boy, he reported to the police and the police \narrested him and kept him for days.\"\n\n14.32\n\nAsivosuo Oriye, the Counsel for the Commission, says she is not allowed to address the Commission on matters \noutside the inquiry.\n\nMr. Aguma, the PDP lawyer, did not attend today's proceedings.\n\nThe argument over, the Commission calls the first witness, Austin Ahiamadu, who filed a petition over claims of \narson and killings.\n\nMr. Ahiamadu says he is the Executive Chairman of ONELGA and a \"politician\" by profession.\n\nThe Commission says they do not have the original copies of Mr. Ahiamadu's evidence, only the photocopies.\n\nThe Council Chairman says he has a \"medical issue\" and can only return to the proceedings next week.\n\n\n\nMr. Odinkalu says the rules stops them from accepting photocopies of evidence.\n\n\"If we go ahead to accept law, we are manufacturing law, and we are not here to manufacture law. We can only \nstep this down for now so the issue can be sorted out.\"\n\n14.08\n\nMr. Nwofor says the Commission is not bound by the order. He also says the order had expired on May 2nd and \nwas brought almost 10 days after it ceased to exist.\n\nHe quotes the Federal High Court Rules (2009), \"No order obtained ex-parte shall last for more than 14 days after \nthe party or person affected by the order has applied for the order to be varied or discharged. Or last for another 14 \ndays after application to vary or discharge it has been argued.\n\n\"The judge had agreed for the respondents to respond by three days upon service. It means that until you are \nserved there is nothing you can do. \"\n\nA member of the panel says that Mr. Aguma had insisted on Monday that a mere bringing the attention of the \nCommission is enough for it to stop sitting.\n\nMr. Nwofor says that was not how service should be done.\n\n\"The Federal High Court where he obtained the court order has rules on how to serve parties. You cannot be \npunished when you've not been served.\n\n\"All we have here is drama, not law. It is only law that can stop you. You should continue because there is nothing \nin law that should stop. And if you stop, it means you are shirking your responsibility which you are not known for.\"\n\n13.57\n\nOn the issue of service, Mr. Nwofor says that service of any court process is fundamental.\n\n\"It is my submission on service that since the Commission was not a party to the suit ab initio, it is impossible to \neven be talking about serving it.\n\n\"Secondly, this order was gotten from the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt. And service of court processes is \ngoverned by Order 6 of the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2009. It states those empowered by the law \nto effect service and E.C Aguma is not one of them.\"\n\nMr. Odinkalu asks if the order also restrains the members from doing anything.\n\nMr. Nwofor says they did not come to the venue of the hearing on their own volition.\n\n\"You are here as a Commission. The judge who gave this order is not sitting as Justice Ganjuwa, he is sitting as the \nFederal High Court.\n\n\"I'm not addressing you as Mr. Odinkalu, I am addressing you as the Commission.\n\nHe says the PDP are shouting 'due process of law' but are violating the same 'due process' by not serving the court \norder properly.\n\n\"If you can't serve, you go for substituted service. That there is no proper service is one more reason why it cannot \nstand.\"\n\nAyo Obe, a member of the panel, says the Commission saw a photocopy of the court order on May 11th.\n\n\"In view of the failure of the plaintiff to serve the parties, what is your view regarding the subsistence of the order or \nhas it been renewed or is there an expiry date?\n\n\n\nMr. Nwofor says parties must be served personally and asks if any member of the panel had been served. He says \nthe PDP lawyer is not the one to serve the order because he is not a bailiff.\n\n\"What is the legal effect if a party who ought to be served is not served? Luckily, this question has been answered \nby the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The case of Ralph Uwazurike and 6 others versus AGF (2013) says: 'In the absence of service of the order, the \nrespondent is not expected to obey it. An order not served on a respondent loses its potency and the respondent is \nnot bound by it.'\"\n\n13.54\n\nMr. Nwofor reads from the Supreme Court decision: \"A court of law has no power to make an order against the \ninterest of a person who is not before it as such an order is not binding on the party.\"\n\nHe insists that the suit does not include the name of the Commission and yet the order is seeking to stop the \nCommission.\n\n\"It is a fatal error on their (PDP) part to have failed to include the Commission of Inquiry.\"\n\nHe says the court's interim order mentioned that it was restraining the 'Commission of Inquiry' who is not a party to \nthe suit.\n\n\"The Commission is a separate body, it is existing in law before you appoint chairman or any member of it.\"\n\nMr. Nwofor cites another Supreme Court authority: \"The only reason for making a person party to an action is so \nthe person is bound by the order of an action.\"\n\nHe says Mr. Aguma wrote a letter to the Commission without copying his client.\n\nPage one of that letter says: \"The instruction of our client is that we bring to the attention of the Commission to the \nexistence of a court order...\"\n\n\"This is a clear and unmistakeable admission that the Commission exists. The truth staring us in the face is that the \nCommission is not a party in the suit and so cannot stop sitting.\"\n\n13.53\n\nP.A.I Nwofor, counsel to Rivers State governor and representing the State Attorney-General, says he wishes to \naddress the Commission on the ex-parte order produced by Emmanuel Aguma, the PDP Counsel.\n\nMr. Nwofor starts by drawing the attention of the Commission to the instrument by which the Commission was set \nup.\n\n\"Looking at the first paragraph: In line 5 thereof that his Excellency first action was that he constituted and \nappointed a Commission of Inquiry,\" says Mr. Nwofor, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.\n\n\"Secondly, I submit that this Commission of Inquiry is, in law, a separate and distinct legal entity on its own having \nregards to the law under which it was set up, that is the Rivers State Commission of Inquiry Law cap 30, particularly \nSection 2(1).\n\n\"Having said that, I will go further to still refer to the instrument constituting this Commission, in paragraph 2, 'and \nfor this purpose I appoint' and seven names were listed. The names listed in that paragraph are merely chairman \nand members of that entity called Commission of Inquiry.\n\n\n\n\"If it were not so, I humbly submit, then there will be no point in calling them members of the Commission. The \nCommission is a separate entity. If the Commission is not in existence, you cannot by any stretch of the \nimagination, you cannot be chairman or members of a non-existent entity.\n\n\"The purported order produced from the bar by E.C Aguma, counsel to the PDP.... Looking at the first page of that \norder, you will see that the parties are PDP designated as applicants and Professor Chidi Odinkalu, Samuel Egbe, \nand other members of the Commission, the state governor, the Nigerian Police, and others.\n\n\"My submission is that the parties in the suit in which this interim order was obtained does not include the \nCommission of Inquiry as a separate and distinct body. Looking at the representative capacity, you will see that the \nPDP formulated the following words: \"for themselves and as Chairman and members of the Commission.\"\n\n\"I submit that this is not a suit against the Commission as a separate juristic body. An order of court is only binding \non the parties in a suit, according to a Supreme Court decision.\"\n\n13.49\n\nThe Commission are yet to begin today's sitting due to several delays.\n\nFirst they had to move resumption time to 11 a.m. as a result of the suit at the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt \nrestraining their sitting.\n\nThe case did not come up at the court today because the judge failed to sit, Asivosuo Oriye, the Counsel for the \nCommission told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nThen the members of the Commission had to spend two hours at the Department of Security Services, DSS, \nheadquarters meeting with the agency's Director.\n\nProceedings are about to start.\n\n17.51\n\nThank You for following this live blog. Hearing sessions continues tomorrow.\n\n17.44\n\nMr. Amadi says that after the election, no warrant of arrest had been served on him.\n\nMr. Amadi is the last witness to testify today.\n\nThe panel adjourns proceedings till Tuesday.\n\n17.23\n\nMr. Amadi says he petitioned the Rivers State Police Commissioner and the IGP - the former on the burnt houses \nand the latter complaining about the CP's plan to detain him.\n\n\"On April 1st, a team the IG sent from Abuja came and took my statement. The next morning, they were on their \nway to make arrests when the CP called them to abort the mission. The CP told them arrests would mean they are \ntaking sides in a political situation. So they aborted the mission and promised to come back after the election.\"\n\nHe says when the hoodlums were burning his father's house, the police stopped the village vigilante group from \nintervening.\n\n\"They are PDP thugs because it was the same persons who came to tear my posters. The vigilante boys identified \nsome of them. The boys mobilised from the house of one Ephraim Nwuzi, a known PDP member.\"\n\nThe panel is pushing the House of Assembly member real hard now.\n\n\n\nHe admits there was a petition \"hurriedly concocted\" by some PDP chiefs accusing him of murder of Mr. Asuquo.\n\nHe says the police did not invite him for questioning but, rather, the CP signed a detention order for his arrest.\n\n\"I was reliably told that the CP signed a detention warrant against me, which I immediately informed the governor. \nThe governor quickly called the CP and he denied issuing any detention order and promised to get back to him. He \nnever did.\"\n\nThe Commission asks him if he ever saw any detention order and he replies in the negative.\n\nBut Mr. Amadi insists the police planned to put him away.\n\nThe Commission tells him a detention order cannot be signed for someone who had not been arrested, and that a \nwarrant of arrest is different from a detention order.\n\nThe Commission says it's bad for an \"honourable\" who had enjoyed police protection to accuse the police of bias.\n\nMr. Amadi says he was justified to accuse the police of bias because he had not enjoyed police protection and that \nthey had locked him and other House members out of their offices at the House Assembly.\n\n16.35\n\nVictor Amadi, a member representing Etche Constituency 1 at the Rivers State House of Assembly, is testifying on \nalleged arson. He says he was informed on the night of March 20th by his brother that hoodlums came in a bus, \nnumbering more than 40, to burn my uncle's house, my father's house. \"I didn't want to look at it as a political issue, \nI want to see it as a criminal issue. \"It's a build up issue. On 20th December, on my way to the village for a wedding, \nsome of supporters came to inform me that some PDP thugs were brandishing guns and shooting. One of them \nactually shot himself... \"On 20th of March, my father's house was burnt down.\" He accuses the police of being \npartisan in their investigations and urges the Commission to thoroughly investigate the incident. He says the PDP \nthugs were boasting that they had the state Commissioner at their beck and call. He says the police had not invited \nhim over the death of Emmanuel Asuquo, which resulted six days after his supporters had a scuffle with him. He \nsays one of the hoodlums named IBB called him on the phone and told him he was going to retaliate Mr. Asuquo's \ndeath.\n\n16.15\n\nJohnson Onunwa, another witness, steps out to give his testimony on allegations of arson.\n\nHe says he is a police inspector who works in Benin.\n\n\"My elder brother called me at about 8.45 plm and I was told that my house is burnt, including his and my senior \nsister.\n\n\"I asked what happened, they said it's because of this PDP-APC thing. I said I'm not a politician so why will they \nburn my house.\"\n\nHe says he wants the panel to investigate what led to the incidents.\n\nHe says he is not a politicians and he doesn't live in the community, but that two of his brothers are politicians.\n\n\"When I got home, I ask them for the police station where the case was reported. They said the elders in the \ncommunity had intervened. And they said the case had been reported to the state CID.\"\n\nHe says his properties, including his motorcycle, were burnt in the fire.\n\n15.40\n\n\n\nPanel reconvenes with George Oreremie, 69, a Delta State indigene living in the state, stepping out to testify on \nalleged assault against him on January 10th.\n\nHe says some unidentified men rushed into a compound where himself and about 15 others were holding a \nmeeting and attacked them.\n\n\"As soon as they came in, they started shouting 'We don't need APC in this Rumueme community. All of you here \nare APC and you will all die today.'\"\n\n\"The next thing they start cutting us with cutlasses and weapons. They used cutlass on me and cut my head. I've \nnever seen them and I don't know them. I'm not from the community so I don't know anyone.\"\n\nHe removes his hat and shows where the machete had been used.\n\nHe says he was hospitalized for ten days and had been going for medical check-up ever since.\n\n\"When they came to see me at the hospital, Tony Okocha, the Chief of Staff, said the police are not co-operating \nwith the report and incidence.\"\n\nHe says he had lived in Rumueme for six years and only joined the APC two years ago, after it was formed.\n\n\"I don't know any of them (the attackers). It was my first time of going to that kind of meeting.\"\n\nHe says the attack had meant he would no longer be able to continue with his job.\n\n\"I used to be a Base Engineer until my company in Calabar shut down, before I came back to Port Harcourt. Before \nthe injury, I do repairs for companies when they need me,\" adding that he's an experienced Marine engineer who \nrepairs ship engines.\n\nThe panel Chairman asks what he wants the Commission to do for him and he replies:\n\n\"If they (the Commission) can give me a small contract to survive with... (He laughs). It's the purpose why we \ncame.\"\n\nHe said it was the APC that paid his hospital bills.\n\n15.38\n\nThe Chairman calls for a short recess.\n\nSitting will reconvene at 3pm.\n\n14.41\n\nThe deceased's son, Justice Orikwowu, 19, takes to the witness stand. He says he was at home on the day of the \nincident. He says he saw his father's corpse at the police station. The panel chairman asks the young man: \n\"Justice, what do you want to do with your life?\" He replies: \"My dad always wanted all of us to go to school. So I \nwant to continue to go to school. I've always wanted to be an engineer.\"\n\n14.35\n\nMrs. Ruth Orikwowu, the widow, is now testifying.\n\nShe says she is a house wife.\n\n\"That fateful day, as APC youth leader, he was a ward collation agent of the party. He went for the election. We are \nnot on the same polling unit.\n\n\n\n\"In my own unit, I went to ease myself, when I came back, they said some people came in military fatique and told \npeople to lie down.\n\n\"They came and carried my husband.\"\n\nShe says they had gotten information about an attack on their family in the past and they ran away.\n\nShe says it was at the police station she saw her husband's corpse.\n\nShe says she had been kidnapped in the past and kept in the bush for five days.\n\nShe says she fears for the safety of her life and that of her seven children.\n\n\"Please look at me. Seven children without a father. I am 41 years old, without anything.\n\n\"My husband served Rivers State government very well. So I'm pleading with this honourable court to assist. The \nhouse he was building he couldn't finish. We live in an uncompleted building.\"\n\nShe begs for assistance for the family.\n\n14.31\n\nMrs. Orikwowu says she is an APC member, and that she could not tell the other APC members present at the \nplace her husband was killed because it was a different polling unit from hers.\n\nShe says her eldest son had just finished writing WAEC, and that all her children, except the baby, are in school.\n\nShe says none of the APC leaders had come to assist her family or even pay a condolence visit.\n\nShe says she collapsed when the news of her husband's death was relayed to her.\n\nMrs. Orukwowu says she was kidnapped on 21st October 2012, during the flood, and her husband's car was burnt \nlast year.\n\nShe says the kidnap was reported to the police but nobody was arrested.\n\n\"People should come to our aid. We have nowhere else to go, that's why I returned to the house. And if I take the \nchildren out of that place they cannot go to school again.\n\n\"We need safety from the government. If my husband is being killed by unknown people, who am I and my \nchildren.\"\n\n14.30\n\nMr. Orikwowu says that on that fateful day, on the day of the governorship election, he spoke with his brother three \ntimes in the morning before he was killed.\n\nHe says his late brother, Clever, was an APC leader in ONELGA.\n\n\"What we gathered that armed men came and laid down everybody.\"\n\nHe says the corpse is still at the mortuary and that the autopsy is yet to be done but that the DPO. Had told them \nthat it will be done.\n\nHe says his brother was 43 and had just graduated at UST and was preparing to go to Law School.\n\nThe deceased's wife, Ruth, and their seven children - the oldest child is 19 and the youngest is 11 months - are \npresent at the proceedings.\n\n\n\n14.29\n\nAnother witness, Isaac Orikwowu, steps out to testify. He is accompanied by a woman nursing a baby whose \nhusband was killed during the election.\n\nMr. Orukwowu said he wrote the petition on behalf of the widow, who was married to his younger brother.\n\n\"When this issue happened, my elder brother informed me. I was in Port Harcourt. They told me he was killed on \nelection ground when he went for accreditation.\n\n\"They said gun men went there, picked him out and shot him. At a community primary school, Ward 5, in \nONELGA. I was not there.\"\n\n14.28\n\nMr. Nwuchegbuo says some of the community heads had become involved in partisan politics. \"I reported the \nincident to the community elders and they said they will look into the matter after the election. \"Since that time till \nnow, I've not heard anything from them. I didn't go the Onye-isi (head) Etche because he's is already a PDP \nmember.\" He says APC members hardly defended themselves when attacked by PDP members. He says he had \nbeen in PDP earlier and only crossed to the opposition after Governor Rotimi Amaechi cross-carpeted. He says \nafter he defeated one Emmanuel Asuquo in a councillorship election in 2008, the two families stopped speaking to \neach other. And things escalated after Asuquo died of \"malaria and typhoid\" as he was accused of being the killer. \n\"In Etche, if you kill somebody, you can't come to the village for seven years. Since this incident, I have been \nfrequenting the village to prove to them that I did not kill anybody.\" He says he built his burnt house in four months \nand it cost \"at most, N5.5 million.\"\n\n14.27\n\nMr. Nwuchegbuo says some of the community heads had become involved in partisan politics. \"I reported the \nincident to the community elders and they said they will look into the matter after the election. \"Since that time till \nnow, I've not heard anything from them.

After one hour, no police had come. It was later that I called the \nSSS and they went there but they said the number of people there were too much. \"When I discovered the police \nwere not ready to do any investigation, that was when I alerted the SSS.\" He says that the same people regrouped \nand came back on March 20th to burn the houses of Victor Amadi and that of his father.\n\n14.23\n\nA member of the panel says that the photos submitted showed that Mr. Nwuchegbuo's building was badly \ndamaged but not burnt down.\n\n14.21\n\nMr. Onuwna: \"I didn't challenge them because they were in a group, I didn't know if they will kill me.

I'm \n\n\n\na poor man, I know how many years I suffered to build that house.\" \"I told one of my brothers, Paulson Opurum, to \ngo and ask Macaulay Onyegbule Asuquo what I did to him and he said he'll annihilate all the members of his \nkindred. \"Macaulay was the one leading the boys. He was the one who poured the fuel. They stayed till the fire \nburned before they begin to scatter the house. I was in hiding. \"I know it was petrol they poured because one of \nthat Onyegbule child do stay petrol. I saw the container they used, it is petrol.\"\n\n12.51\n\nAnother witness, Loveday Onunwa, steps out to testify. He says he is a stock fish trader and resides at Rumuikpe, \nOzuzu, in Etche local government. \"I want this panel to tell the government to compensate. My house is burnt, I \ndon't know what to do.\" During cross examination, Mr. Onunwa says he is not a politician. \"I'm not a politician but \ntwo of my children are a politician. Chidi and Stanley. They are a member of APC. \"Now I've run to my mother's \nhouse at Elele-Etche. That's where I live now.\" He says when he was informed they were burning his house, he \nrushed back from the market to see people pouring fuel on his house \"and then the fuel catch.\" \"After the fire was \nfinished, they came back to break the walls.\" He says they burnt his son's and destroyed his sister's house.\n\n12.31\n\nMr. Nwuchegbuo says the community only sent sympathisers to his family who told him the matter \"is above them.\" \n\"They told me before the election, that I shouldn't come home to cast my vote and I thought it was child's play. On \nthat day I didn't come home to vote.\" Mr. Nwuchegbuo says the houses burnt include his own 6 bedroom \nbungalow, his father's 6 bedroom bungalow, and two other buildings consisting of four and three rooms. He says \nhe started building his own house in 2009 and finished it in December last year. A member of the panel says that \nthe photos submitted showed that Mr. Nwuchegbuo's building was badly damaged but not burnt down. Mr. \nNwuchegbuo urges the panel to come and physically inspect the building.\n\n12.28\n\nMr. Nwuchegbuo says he wants three favours from the Commission: 1. A proper investigation of the people who \nburnt my house. 2. A protection of my life through the police. 3. The government should be able to compensate me. \n\"I've never associated with anything politics in my life because I'm a civil servant. \"The burning of my house is \npolitical. My younger brother, Blessing Nwuchegbuo, is an ex-Supervisory councillor and, by the grace of God, the \nSecretary to the local government. \"They said Blessing will not stay in the community to cast his vote. \"The incident \ntook place on a market day. My mother was in the market during the incident. She's with me in Port Harcourt now, \nincluding my sister and nephew. They don't have anywhere to live again.\"\n\n12.17\n\nThe second witness, Kenneth Nwuchegbuo, steps out to testify. Mr. Nwuchegbuo, a teacher, says his house was \nburnt during the election violence. \"I am here in respect of the burning of my house and my father's house. They \nare in Ozuzu in Etche local government. They were burnt on Thursday the 19th of March 2015.\" \"I was in the \nschool when I received a call from Mr. Godspower Opurum that he received a call from his wife and that he's at \nElele, at about 5.30pm. That my father's house, my mother's house, including my own is being set down by some \nhoodlums. \"He mentioned about 13 names who happened to be PDP members. \"For security reasons, I didn't \ntravel that moment. It was on the 20th I travelled. Somebody burning your house, you don't just go there, they can \nburn you if they see you.\" He tenders photos of the burnt houses before the panel.\n\n12.15\n\nMr. Opurum ends his testimony by saying he would be willing to return to his community since the elections have \nended. \"I cannot change my mind about being a member of APC. I'll continue being APC. I don't have problem with \nanybody. That's not my system of politics, to be angry with people.\" #RiversInquiry\n\n11.27\n\n\n\nMr. Opurum says he took photographs of his house that was burnt during election violence in the state. \"I want the \npanel to help me so that I can rebuild my house,\" he says. He says he lived at Rumuekpe before his house was \nburnt. \"My wife called me, I was at Elele. When I reached my community, I saw them burning Blessing Uchegbu's \nhouse. I ran back to my own house. \"After that, they came to my own house. I had to dodge somewhere in my \nbackyard to see them well. I saw them pouring fuel on my house. My wife and everybody has gone out.\" Mr. \nOpurum says he knows the people that burnt his house and could provide their names, if required. \"They were \nmany but I will mention few, Stanley Asuquo,... Ephraim, Ahamefule Nwobodo, and others.\" He says the incident \nhappened on March 19th.\n\n11.23\n\nThe PDP lawyer leaves the venue of the proceedings. Godspower Opurum, the first witness for the day, steps out \nto testify before the Commission. He says he filed a complaint before the Commission over allegations of arson.\n\n11.23\n\nMr. Odinkalu insisted that the arguments would be taken on Wednesday. \"The Commission does not confer \nlawfulness where lawfulness does not exist. What I suggest is, we are seeing this for the first time. We will hear \narguments about this on Wednesday and listen to judicial authorities. \"If on Wednesday we cannot continue, it \nmeans that all the records will be expunged.\" But the PDP lawyer stood his ground and asked to be excused from \nthe proceedings.\n\n11.21\n\nThere is a heated exchange between the PDP lawyer and the panel. Mr. Aguma objected to the adjournment on \nWednesday on the grounds that the 14 day life span of an interim court order would have elapsed. And that the \nmatter is also coming up at the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt. \"How do I participate in a proceeding where I \nhave questioned its legality? When I'm questioning the competence of the Commission to proceed,\" he said. \n#RiversInquiry\n\n10.34\n\nThe inquiry begins with Emmanuel Aguma, the counsel to the PDP, informing the Commission that there is a court \norder restraining the proceedings and that it is the duty of the panel to obey the court.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be a part of a process that does not obey the rule of law, so I'm bringing attention to this. There's \nan order temporarily restraining proceedings here till a fixed date,\" said the lawyer.\n\nChidi Odinkalu, the Chairman of the Commission, said they had not been served the court's decision.\n\n\"We are accepting because you are an officer of the law,\" he said.\n\n\"We've not been served on us. But we are accepting from you.\n\n\"We are seeing this for the first time. Do you want a brief on this and we take an argument on this on Wednesday. \nSo serious we need to place everyone on record.\"\n\nThere is now an argument over whether the Commission can continue today's proceedings and leave decision on \nthe court order till Wednesday.\n\n08.05\n\nABIA - Results\n\nGrand Total\n\nACPN = 2323\n\n\n\nAPC = 10,244\n\nAPGA = 180,882\n\nCPP = 348\n\nKOWA = 95\n\nLP = 801\n\nNCP 99\n\nPDC = 352\n\nPDP = 264,713\n\nPPA = 4381\n\nUPP = 309\n\nSummation of April re-run results as announced by INEC in Umuahia, the state capital.\n\nProf Ozumba, the state returning officer, at about 4:54am, while announcing the results and declaring the \ngovernorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Okezie Ikpeazu, winner of the April polls said PDP \npooled 264,713 while his closest rival and former Managing Director of Diamond Bank, Alex Otti, candidate of the \nAll Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) got 180,882 votes.\n\nBoth parties yet to make official statement on the conduct and outcome of the polls results.\n\nMeanwhile, as at the time of this report, supporters of PDP in Umuahia, Aba and other parts of the state are in a \ngreat jubilation as fireworks rent the air.\n\n22.57\n\nGOMBE\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) has won re-run election in Kwami East state House of Assembly elections in \nGombe state.\n\nAnnouncing the results on Saturday night in Malam-Sidi, the Returning Officer, Salisu Umar, said that Ahmed \nAbubakkar of the PDP was elected with 10, 326 votes while Shuaibu Haruna of the APC came second with 8,979 \nvotes.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that during the April, 11 election in the constituency, there was no clear \nwinner following the cancellation of the results of four polling units because of irregularities.\n\nNAN also reports that the election was conducted peacefully (NAN)\n\n21.13\n\nIMO Results (INEC Declarations)\n\nNkwerre Local Government.

Badagry they said we won but by the time they took \nit to some riverine areas and came back, we lost by about 200-300 votes.\"\n\nThe Collation Officer's remark that he was disappointed with Mr. Owokoniran's comments and his failure to watch \nhis party's votes infuriated the party agent.\n\n\"There are no results in 10 local governments in Lagos West. Whether you are disappointed or not, I don't care,\" \nMr. Owokoniran said.\n\nTokunbo Afikuyomi, APC agent, noted that all manner of complaints arise during an election.\n\n\"I think it's importnant we understand there are processes. To come and be making allegations about results being \ntampered with without any shred of evidence is not decent.\n\n\"I am saying that unless there is any evidence. For example, in Apapa, I have issues but I will wait until we get \nthere.\"\n\nAn agent for the PPN also raised concerns that results are not yet ready 24 hours after voting ended in most local \ngovernments.\n\n\"We are beginning to feel uncomfortable with the trend. In a particular local government, results are not being \ncollated at the collation centre but elsewhere.\"\n\nMr. Owokoniran responded by submitting two petitions from the party, adding that they have documents and facts \nto back up their claims.\n\nAkin Orebiyi, the state REC urged all parties to \"exercise some patience between now and when they arrive. \nWhether they like it or not, they will turn up here.\"\n\n\"The state collation centre is not a turf for any form of fighting whether physical or verbal and we will not hesitate \nanybody who does that to excuse us.\n\n\"Our job here also entail as collation centre we wait for them to come and see if they'll present anything different,\" \nhe said, adding that copies of election results are always given to party agents, the senior police officer present, a \npresiding officer, and one pasted on the wall for the public.\n\nMr. Orebiyi attributed the delay to the volume of work being done by the INEC officials.\n\n\n\n\"We are collating, for the first time in years, results of three elections in one day.

PREMIUM TIMES was at Tombia Road polling unit, \nGRA, Port Harcourt at 9.20 am. Over 30 voters had already arrived and were waiting for the arrival of INEC \nofficials.\n\nAt Oroworukwu Town Hall, D-Line Port Harcourt, PREMIUM TIMES spotted a PDP poster on the wall of the \nbuilding which is under construction. The town hall is used at a central distribution center for all the units in D-line.\n\nElectoral officials were loading materials into buses guarded by security agents including the police, Nigeria \nSecurity and Civil Defence Corps, Nigerian Prisons, Nigerian Customs Service and Nigerian Immigration Service.\n\nAt Ikwere Local Government, home of the state governor, PREMIUM TIMES ran into Governor Rotimi Amaechi at \nOmuanwu Ward, Omute Playground Unit. At the unit, Mr.Amaechi was told that INEC has supplied all the materials \nexcept the result sheets. The voters argued that they would not be accredited until the result sheets are brought to \nthe centre.\n\nResponding, a visibly angry Mr. Amaechi said INEC is deliberately undermining the electoral laws by not supplying \nresult sheets in the local government area.\n\n\"You can see that the result sheets have not been brought here. The same thing is happening all over the local \ngovernment area,\" said Mr. Amaechi.\n\n\"We have therefore resolved not to be involved in the election until the result sheets are brought.\n\n\"This is my local government area and this is happening. The same thing is happening all over the place.\"\n\nAfter talking to journalists at the unit, Mr. Amaechi, who drove himself in a bullet-proof BMW jeep, turned and drove \ntowards his family compound in Obima but was stopped by a detachment of troops led by the Commander of the \n2nd Brigade, Nigeria Army, Bori Camp, Brigadier General Essien Essien.\n\nA minor altercation ensued between Mr.Essien and the governor over the legality of Mr. Amaechi moving around \nwith a convoy while election is going on.\n\nMr. Amaechi told the army boss the problem voters were encountering in the area and noted that as the governor \nof the state, he has the right to make sure that elections are conducted within the ambit of the law. \"Brigade \nCommander, why are you mountings two road blocks near my father's compound,\" he said.\n\n\"Are you being sent by President Jonathan to kill me? I had told the world that President Jonathan is trying to kill \nme and I am saying it again.\"\n\nMr. Essien denied being given any instruction to kill anybody and asked the governor to go back to his home and \nstop moving about.\n\n\"His Excellency, we have instructions not to allow people who are not duly accredited not to move around during \nthe election,\" Mr. Essien said.\n\n\"That is why we are advising you to go back to your house and wait there until the election is over.\"\n\nThe brigade commander also told the governor that the military was not blocking his house, adding that they had \ninstructions to ensure that law and order is maintained.\n\nThe argument became a bit heated when the governor said he was going back to Government House on Port \nHarcourt to wait until the result sheets are brought for him to come and vote.\n\n\n\nWhen Mr. Essien insisted that the governor must go back to his family house and wait, Mr. Amaechi said he would \nnot, adding that the Brigade Commander can arrest him if that is what he wants to do.\n\nPutting out his two hands in front towards the Brigade Commander, Mr. Amaechi said, \"Arrest me if that's what you \nwant to do or allow me return to Government House I'm Port Harcourt.\n\n\"There is nobody in this house. It is my father's house. I don't have a house in my village.\"\n\nAfter about 12 minutes of argument between the two, Mr. Essien allowed Mr. Amaechi to drive back with his convoy \nto Port Harcourt but advised him not to stop anywhere along the road to monitor the election.\n\n18.09\n\nLagos\n\nResults are out at Polling Unit 008 Epetedo, Igbosere Street, in Lagos Island President Apc 62 Pdp 61 Senate Apc \n70 Pdp 52 Reps Apc 61 Pdp 52 Chants of 'Sai Buhari' rents the air.\n\n18.06\n\nPlateau\n\nUnaccredited voters vote in Plateau Some registered voters who could not be accredited were allowed to vote in \nsome parts of Plateau State. One of such voters narrated her experience at the polling unit at Apata in Jos North \nLocal Government Area. \"I was having my temporary voter card. When it was announced that people should queue \nfor voting, I joined and was given three ballot papers and I voted,\" the female voter, who asked not to be named, \nsaid. Another voter in the same unit said, \"I attempted accreditation twice, but the card reader rejected me. But \nwhen it was said all those with PVCs should come and vote, it was an expressway, I voted without hindrances.\" \nDue to the challenges caused by the card readers, rather than resort to the manual accreditation, voters with their \ncards simply queued, were issued ballot papers and voted. Meanwhile, at the end of voting at the Nigeria Union of \nJournalist NUJ polling unit, Governor Jonah Jang who is contesting the Senate for Plateau north lost to All \nProgressives Congress' Eunice Sambo by 16 to 22 votes However, President Goodluck Jonathan defeated \nMohammadu Buhari in the polling unit by 26 votes to 16 with 8 invalid votes.\n\n17.50\n\nTaraba\n\nResidents insist on voting. Most people in Jalingo, the capital city of Taraba State, journeyed to their villages to \nvote a candidate of their choosing. Jalingo looked like a ghost town with few vehicles on the streets.. In Takum \ntown, a lot of their indigenes living outside the town came \"home\" says Johnny Ande, who resides Jalingo but \ntravelled to Takum to vote. \"l want to be part of history in the Nigeria project, my vote must count that is why I am \nhome to my village, he said. \"I came to vote for my President and my Senator so that I can tell my children \nsomeday that I voted during the election,\" another returnee, Mary Odah, said. The Peoples Democratic Party \ngovernorship candidate, Daraius Ishaku, urged people to be law abiding at his polling unit at Gawatun. \nAccreditation started really late in parts of Taraba.\n\n17.46\n\nKastina\n\nAccreditation still on going at Buhari's polling unit in Daura.\n\n17.41\n\nOndo\n\n\n\nOndo State Governor, Olusegun Mimiko, speedily drives out of his polling unit minutes before the release of results \nin the unit.\n\n17.28\n\nOgun\n\nCounting of votes has commenced in many polling units in Ogun State. As at 4.30 p.m., many of the centres had \nstarted collation and counting of the votes while voters waited patiently to witness the process Agents of the various \nparties were also seen at the polling units. Long queues of voters were, however, still seen in some polling units at \n4:45 p.m.\n\n17.24\n\nLagos\n\nNigeria: INEC approves postponement of elections in some areas The Independent National Electoral Commission, \nINEC, has approved the postponement to Sunday of elections in some polling units where accreditation was \nchallenging. Two of the polling units affected by such postponement are at Iyalla Street in Alausa, Ikeja, where the \npresiding officer announced the postponement because card readers were not working and there was no back-up. \nIt is not yet clear the full details of polling units affected by such postponements and total number of voters that \ncould be affected. However, in a statement via its twitter handle @inecnigeria on Saturday evening, the electoral \nagency stated that \"in PUs where accreditation was suspended to the next day in accordance with the guidelines, \narrangements will be made for voters to vote tomorrow, subject to the provisions of the Electoral Act 2010.\" The \nstatement also gave permission to electoral officials to do manual accreditation of voters when card readers are \ncausing problems. Saturday's elections are to elect a president and members of the federal parliament in Africa's \nlargest country. The presidential elections is seen as one of the closest in the nation's history and is mainly \nbetween the incumbent President, Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party, and Muhammadu Buhari \nof the All Progressives Congress.\n\n17.20\n\nLagos\n\nVoting is almost coming to an end at the Polling Unit 006 at Moloney Street in Lagos Island.

Eniola Michael, a resident, said he \ndid his accreditation around 9 a.m. \"Up till now we are still waiting for ballot papers. All of us here. A lot of people \ncame from far place just for them to do their accreditation, and wait till 1 and do their voting. But they are still \nwaiting. Nothing is being done. \"We asked them (INEC officials), they said they are waiting for the ballot paper, that \nwe should keep calm and the ballot paper is coming. You can see this is after 4 and movement starts by 5, when \n\n\n\nare we going to vote. \"The card reader was perfect.\" The INEC presiding officer at the polling unit said they were \nwaiting for the ballot paper. Asked if they were not supposed to resume with all the materials, the official said he \nwas not authorized to \"disclose that information.\" \"The only thing I can tell you is that we are waiting for the ballot \npapers. If you need other information, you should meet the PRO.\" Some voters who were drenched during the \ndownpour complained that the rain washed away the voting ink on their fingers.\n\n16.26\n\nDelta\n\nVoting commences in parts of Delta, accreditation ongoing in others Voting started as scheduled in many of the \npolling stations in Delta State in the presidential and National Assembly elections.

You who are voting will have to understand that \npoliticians will always tell lies.\"\n\nMrs. Oyekanmi noted that studies showing that there is a \"feminization\" of poverty - women getting poorer at a \nfaster rate.\n\n\"We have to put into perspective that poverty does not affect everybody equally.\"\n\nThe symposium moves into a question and answer session.\n\n15.08\n\nDapo Olorunyomi, Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief, PREMIUM TIMES newspaper.\n\nSpeaking on 'Investigative Journalism as Tool of Social Restoration,' he said that poverty entails excluding people \nfrom economic, social, financial and other powers.\n\nHe said despite the government's report on the growth of the economy, an IMF recent report has questioned if \nsomething is wrong with our data.\n\n\"If you have growth of 9 to 12 percent in the Agricultural Sector, you shouldn't be talking about this level of \nunemployment.\"\n\nHe also identified Nigeria's central challenges as corruption, insecurity, unemployment, democratic consolidation, \nand poverty.\n\n\"The choices or lack of choices that people are making in positions of authority is leading to growth or the \nchallenges we are having in the economies of the country.\"\n\nMr. Olorunyomi said that Nigerians are dealing with a governance structure that is in dissonance.\n\n\"Amatya Sen, another Nobel laureate, says without a professionally functioning media cannot solve the problem of \npoverty.\n\n\n\n\"In any modern society, the media has a key role and that role is to provide a democratic audit.\n\n\"The media is the only institution in the constitution that holds the government accountable.

When state \ninstitutions descent to the arena, you wonder what kind of democracy you will have.\n\n\"In terms of procedures for deepening democracy, we have not made so much progress.\n\n\"When you are told that Nigeria is progressing in terms of economy, one of the things economists are battling today \nis economy without jobs.

In a university of this stature, you make a \ncall to rationality. You ask for people to think.\n\n\"If you have a situation where a man is running for president without a school certificate, you are going to get \npoverty.\n\n\"I have never voted in this country. But I am going to vote this time.\n\nMr. Aribisala further stated that his letter of invitation to the event read 'Nigerians have not reaped the dividends of \ndemocracy.'\n\n\"This type of statement should not come from a thinking university. We cannot say that in 16 years, Nigerians have \nnot reaped a dividend of democracy, that is a poverty of thinking,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"If campaigns are not bankrolled by political godfathers, there will still be corruption. That's not a reason why there \nis corruption.\n\n\"So many things are wrong with the govt of Goodluck Jonathan, but let us be balanced, in the years of Goodluck \nJonathan, the Nigerian economy has been growing by 7 percent.\n\n\"The third fastest growing economy in the world is Nigeria.\n\nMr. Aribisala's speech causing a a major stir - grumbles and applause - in the hall. People are divided over his \nstatistics.\n\n\"Nigeria is now the 23rd largest economy in the world. The preferred destination for foreign investment in Africa, \nover the past three years,\" Mr. Aribisala continued.\n\n\"Nigerians are now the third largest producer of films in the hall. Nigeria is now Guinea Worm free.\n\n\"You don't tackle corruption by sending people to jail for 300 years. Corruption is tackled at the institutional level.\n\n\"As academics, you need to be balanced.\n\n\"Corruption is not the primary cause of poverty in Nigeria. If there was no corruption, there will still be poverty.\"\n\nMr. Aribisala finishes with an applause from the audience.\n\n14.03\n\nIn his keynote address, Akin Oyebode, a Professor of International Law and Jurisprudence, noted that elections in \nclass societies afford the masses a chance in selecting their executioners.\n\n\"Admittedly, contestants for political power especially in transnational societies and peripheral economies such as \nin Nigeria are [want] to indulge in the belief that they are operating on a level playing field where the most able or \ncompetent contestant...\n\n\"A process that looks more like a bazaar where those with larger wallets will carry the day over those with better \nideas and manifestoes.\"\n\nMr. Oyebode said that Nigerians should be made aware of the various factions and fractions of the political class.\n\nHe cited Arthur Nzeribe's infamous phrase of matching the opponent \"money for money, rice for rice, stockfish for \nstockfish.\"\n\n\"The Nigerian political system is up for grabs and politics here is reminiscent of the Hobbesian war of nature where \nthe victor takes no prisoners.\n\n\"Political parties here constitute a severe problem of choice for the electorates.\n\n\"The necessity to put a ceiling on campaign cost is borne out of the fact that public service should really not cost an \narm and a limb.\n\n\"What we have is plutocracy masquerading as a democracy - a government of the rich by the rich for the rich.\n\n\"The rich here are scandalously demonstrating their opulence because they have their own private airport, private \nroad, private borehole, private electricity...\n\n\"Each rich man is his own private local government.\"\n\nMr. Oyebode also said that the legal framework for financing election campaigns appear ineffective and hollow.\n\n\n\n\"The electoral act of 2010 sets a limit of 1bn for presidential elections, 200 million for governorship election, etc.\n\n\"Severe sanctions are set out for violators of this act.\n\n\"All the provisions have been rendered little more than paper tigers.\"\n\n13.07\n\nProfessor Akingbade recalling with nostalgia how, in the 1970s in Unilag, himself and seven others, including \nEbenezer Babatope, Akin Oyebode, late Niyi Popoola, came together to form an organized, radical public discourse \non public affairs.\n\n\"It was a radical group on campus. That was the era of the military.\n\nAlthough the group folded up in 1979, it laid down the foundation for the radicalism of the Academic Staff Union of \nUniversities.\n\n\"There used to be a culture of radicalism in Unilag. It is not irresponsible radicalism. One hopes that there could be \na revival, a rejuvenation of this kind of things,\" Mr. Akingbade said.\n\nThe next session is a drama presentation titled SID - Stomach Infrastructural Department - by the Theatre Arts \nDeparment of Unilag.\n\n12.51\n\nProfessor Adebayo Ninalowo starts his speech by berating Nigerian journalists.\n\n\"By the time some journalists are accepting a fee to collaborate in some form of calumny rather than engaging \npoliticians to tell us what they will do.\n\n\"They will say this one did not bring out his wife to the public, they are asking for GCE, Cambridge evidence. We \nhave somebody who lays claim to having a doctoral degree at the apex of the polity, I won't say governance. \nIrrespective of that we are still talking about poverty.\"\n\nBy the way, Femi Fani-Kayode was billed to be one of the guest speakers today. But he is conspicuously absent.\n\nMr. Ninalowo also said that he had a problem \"deconstructing\" the title of the symposium.\n\n\"The title talks about looming tsunami of poverty. I had to go to the dictionary to assure myself if indeed I have a \nproper understanding of what looming means. Looming connotes something that is not immediately happening \nwhereas tsunami appears to be a metaphor for crisis...\n\n\"Where will somebody get the money to come and donate billions to campaign. It is corruption?\n\n\"Admittedly, there is no where in the world that there is no corruption, but Nigeria is a special case because that \nwhich we condemn morally, we practice all over the place.\"\n\n12.26\n\nProfessor Ralph Akinfeleye said that the programme was being covered live by Radio Unilag, with a listening \naudience of \"over 60 million people.\"\n\n\"This is the first outing of ASAP in West Africa. It is so unique particularly as we move towards the zero hour of \nelection 2015.\n\n\"My remarks will be based on political reporting and the tsunami of protocol journalism.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Akinfeleye said that ASAP is not focused merely on material poverty. It also focuses on poverty of the intellect, \nof the mind, good character, good leadership, professional integrity, politics without bitterness, political intolerance, \njournalism of conscience (which has now changed to protocol journalism).\n\n\"It is important for journalists to liberate themselves from poverty,\" he said.\n\n\"Journalists are watchdogs but in Nigeria, some of the watchdogs have been infested with rabies, and need anti \nrabies. And the anti rabies can be provided by the NUJ, NGE, Nigerian Press Council, etc.\n\n\"It is expected that the watchdog be seen as providing a representative picture of the society. Anchoring their \nreportage on the concept of truth.\n\n\"Based on recent findings, we know that Nigeria with a 165 million people 671 licensed radio and television \nstations.\"\n\nHe broke it down as 219 FM Stations, 90 AM Stations; 372 TV Stations - 217 licensed and 117 cable stations.\n\nAnd 450 newspapers and magazines.\n\n\"Political reporting is reporting politics whether with or without bitterness. It is as dirty as politics itself. And \nsometimes the reporters are as dirty as the politics they report. They are duty bound to explain the political process, \nwho is contesting, etc.\n\n\"They must not cover the event of political thugs, event of some of our political advisers who to my mind have sold \ntheir conscience.\n\n\"It appears to me that as we move to the 2015 election, some of the political advisers of nearly all the political \nparties have gone beyond their bounds. They have moved from creation of interests to disciples of confusion. From \ndisinformation to propaganda and unnecessary muck-raking.\n\n\"If the political reporters for 2015 are doing their job, they should advise and call political advisers to order. And if \nthey refuse, they should be sent to the Septic Tank Department of Aso Rock.\"\n\n12.04\n\nWith Femi Aribisala's short opening prayer, the programme begins.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Professor Babajide Alo, representing Rahman Ade Bello, the Vice Chancellor, VC, of \nUniversity of Lagos; apologized for the Mr. Bello's unavoidable absence.\n\nReading from the VC's prepared speech, Mr. Alo said that 2015 is a remarkable one in a number of ways, \nincluding meeting of MDG targets, an election year in Nigeria, and a year of focusing on how to curb hunger across \nthe globe.\n\nThe Unilag VC described hunger as a \"formidable threat.\"\n\n\"Political parties contesting elections in Nigeria also have come up with strategies to combat hunger... Universities \nplay a role of drivers and enablers of transformation.\n\n\"The theme of today's seminar is relevant to the very rich tradition that the unilag is known for.\n\n\"Universities all over the world, and Unilag is not an exception, through robust research have always played a \ncrucial role with which existential poverty is addressed. They have also provided the needed human capital that \ndrives growth and development in a country.\n\n\"As at this week, the university of Lagos has become the number 1 university in Nigeria, by external assessors.\"\n\n\n\n18.30\n\nWe have come to the end of the LiveBlog.

Now officials are about to commence counting of the ballots \nearned by each aspirants. They are starting with the box of ballots earned by Atiku Abubakar.\n\n14.35\n\nVote sorting is still ongoing at the Teslim Balogun stadium centre of the APC presidential primary election. Votes for \neach candidate are sorted into unique boxes - one for each candidate. Proper vote counting will commence after \nthe sorting.\n\n10.49\n\nAbubakar Kawu Baraje, who has been announcing the names on the ballots, has now transferred the role to Boss \nMustapha.\n\nThe sun is really up here and the sorting is being done under the sun.\n\nMr. Baraje has however chose to remain by the side of Mustapha as the sorting continues.\n\n10.45\n\nAbubakar Kawu Baraje that have been announcing the names on the ballots have now transferred the role to Boss \nMustapha.\n\nThe Sun is really up here and the sorting is being done under the Sun.\n\nBaraje however chose to remain by the side of Mustapha.\n\n10.42\n\nBuhari in early lead\n\nWith over 1,000 ballots sorted, out of the 7, 214votes at the ongoing All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential \nprimary at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos, a former Head of State, Muhammadu Buhari, has earned more \nballots than his four other challengers.\n\nComing a distance second is the Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, who seems to be performing way \nbeyond expectation and appears to have earned more votes than former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, who is \ngenerally regarded as the most experienced politicians among the lots.\n\nThe Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, is also putting put some contest but he clearly lies in a distant fourth \nposition behind Mr. Atiku, who seems to have gotten the third highest votes at the moment.\n\nNot entirely surprising in fifth place is the Publisher of Leadership Newspapers, Sam Nda-Isaiah, who clearly is the \nless experienced politician of the lot.\n\nMr Nda-Isaiah is yet to get a ballot so far.\n\nIt is however early to award victory to any of the candidates at this time as there are still thousands of ballots to \ncount.\n\nSorting is still on going and PREMIUM TIMES will continue to update you with happenings at the venue.\n\n09.56\n\n\n\nSo far Muhammadu Buhari and Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso are ahead of the other three candidates, followed by \nRochas Okorocha and Atiku Abubakar.\n\nSam Nda-Isaia's name is yet to be called.\n\n09.20\n\nContents of a smaller transparent ballot box being turned into a bigger transparent box before being sorted.\n\n09.06\n\nThe smaller ballot boxes are now being ferried to a location close to the big ballot box.\n\nEach ballot box is accompanied by two fully armed mobile police officers.\n\n09.02\n\nThe sorting process will involve putting all the contents of the transparent ballot boxes into a giant transparent box.\n\nAfter which the ballots will be sorted based on aspirants votes and be placed into separate black boxes.\n\nOnce all ballots are sorted, the content of each of the black box assigned to each aspirant will then be counted.\n\n08.49\n\nThe poll has officially closed. Agents assigned to each of the 40 transparent ballot boxes have been directed to lock \nthe boxes.\n\nReturning officers for the five aspirants have also been asked to approach the boxes.\n\nEach aspirant was given a chance to nominate two returning officers.\n\n08.47\n\nNow it is the turn of Taraba to vote. The state contingent is being led by Senator Aisha Jummai Alhassan, the only \nfemale gubernatorial candidate of the APC.\n\nAfter Taraba, Yobe and Zamfara will be the two final states to vote before sorting and counting begin.\n\n08.44\n\nSome of the delegates from states that have already voted are leaving the Teslim Balogun Stadium even before \nvoting is concluded. Most of the delegates stayed up all night and may either be leaving to catch some sleep or to \nfreshen up after a tedious night.\n\nUnlike the delegates from most states, the delegates from Sokoto are mostly middle-aged men. They are taciturn \nand have trooped to the ballot area without funfare to cast their votes.\n\n08.36\n\nThe last state on the list, Zamfara is currently voting. The state's delegation is led by the Governor, Abdulaziz Yari.\n\nVoting proper began at about 2am, which means the states took approximately 7 hours to completes the voting \nprocesses.\n\nThe sorting and eventually counting is however not expected to take too long.\n\nAlready, the Mobile Policemen in the arena has taken strategic position around the large transparent Ballot box to \nbe used for sorting.\n\n\n\n08.26\n\nNow it is the turn of Taraba to vote. The state contingent is being led by Senator Aisha Jummai Alhassan, the first \nfemale gubernatorial candidate in Nigeria.\n\nAfter Taraba, Yobe and Zamfara will be the two final states to vote before the next stage of sorting and counting \nbegins.\n\n08.04\n\nThe two states of Osun and Oyo are almost done with their voting. Plateau and Rivers have been asked to get \nready and approach the voting area. Rivers contingent is led by the state Governor, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nIf Plateau and Rivers eventually complete voting, we will be left with only three states -- Sokoto, Taraba and \nZamfara.\n\nPart of Sokoto state contingent is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nMr. Tambuwal, like Senator Barnabas Gemade, are attending their first APC National Convention. They both \nrecently crossed from the PDP to the APC.\n\nWe can sight the Speaker from here already leaving the state box to go and meet the delegates from his state to \nbe called upon for voting. He seems anxious to vote.\n\n07.38\n\nOgun state is now set to vote, led by their governor, Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nOgun is the only state which came to the National Convention with a full compliment of drummers and musicians. \nThey have been singing and dancing nearly all night.\n\nAt some point, Governor Amosun himself joined in the dancing and merry making.\n\nOgun also came fully attired in two different sets of Ankara material.\n\nClosely following Ogun is Ondo state, followed by Osun, led by Governor Rauf Aregbesola, and Oyo by Governor \nAbiola Ajimobi.\n\n07.36\n\nAfter Lagos, delegates from Nasarawa and Niger states delegates were called to vote.\n\nBefore being called, we noticed that Governor Tanko Almakura called out delegates from the state to an isolated \nspot at the stadium, perhaps for a last minute decisive meeting.\n\nSam Nda-Isaiah is from Niger state and is therefore leading the contingent from the state to the voting booths.\n\n07.22\n\nGovernor Babatunde Fashola is now leading delegates from Lagos state to go vote.\n\nWe have noticed an increase in the pace of the voting process, perhaps to make up for lost time. We have basically \njust 10 more states to go as far as voting is concerned.\n\nImmediately after voting, the electoral panel will begin the task of sorting the ballots and then counting accordingly.\n\n07.21\n\n\n\nGovernor Babatunde Fashola is now leading delegates from Lagos state to go vote.\n\nWe have noticed an increase in the pace of the voting process, perhaps to make up for lost time.

States are filing out alphabetically to vote. Kano has just finished voting. \nKatsina is next...\n\n03.15\n\nThere are nine boxes of ballot papers with each box containing 1000 ballot papers, making a total of 9000 ballot \npapers. Pictures and names of aspirants are printed based on alphabetical order. Mr. Fayemi said pictures were \ncollected from the aspirants before being used for the election He said 7214 delegates were accredited for the \nelection. He also said the process is simple, as states will be called based on alphabetical order to use the forty \ndesks and voting booth to cast their votes. Delegates are expected to collect ballot papers, go into the booths to \ncast their votes secretly and then come out to drop the ballot papers into the transparent ballot boxes provided. He \nalso said delegates must ensure they thumbprint all ballot papers and then return to their seats in their state \nsection. At the end of the exercise, all the ballot boxes would be uploaded into giant ballot boxes before being \nsorted and counted.\n\n03.11\n\nVoting proper about to commence with the Chairman of the Electoral Committee, Kayode Fayemi, inviting \ndelegates from Abia to come cast their votes.\n\n02.34\n\nChairman of the electoral panel, Kayode Fayemi, now showing the agents of the five aspirants and representatives \nof other relevant bodies the sealed ballot papers.

Delegates may vote in state batches.\n\n02.27\n\n\n\nExcerpts from Okorocha's speech\n\nI am very happy to be part of this history making event. We are the last hope of Nigeria and today we must get it \nright. We formed APC believing that coming from our small parties, we stand a chance. We are here gathered for \nthe love of our nation. We are here to provide for nigeria the much needed dividends of democracy. There is \nnothing wrong with the Head of State, but there can be something wrong with the State of the head. I celebrate \nGeneral Muhammadu Buhari who is today 73 years old, and Atiku is today 68 years old and Kwankwaso who is 52 \nyears old. Jonathan is 57, Barack Obama 53, Rochas Okorocha is only 52 years old. Nigeria of today is different \nthan Nigeria of 1960s. I am here to sing a different song, that of unity. We are here to give Nigeria a good cheque; a \ngood leader. I offer myself to offer service as the president of Nigeria. Political power can only be justified when use \nfor the good of the common man. \"My people, my people\" When I say to Nigerians, I will make education free, \nNigerians will believe me, because I have done it before. I am a child of poor parentage, I hate poverty and what it \nbrings. Today destiny has brought to your shoulder to change the fate of this nation, you must do it well, not on the \nbasis of sentiment. Vote for me and I assure you that the Nigerian Naira will be equal to the dollar. My people My \npeople.\n\n02.17\n\nExcerpts from Sam Nda-Isaiah's speech\n\nAPC has a divine responsibility to win the election next year. This is not the country you want your children to grow \nin. I want to tell you why I'm the best candidate. I fit the slogan of the party, which is change. I don't think that there \nis a better candidate than me. Nigerian wants a new generation to step forward to lead the nation. I'm the only one \nwith a clear plan. I'm the only one that have come with big ideas. That's why I believe I'm the best. This country is \ntoo divided. And there is no country that is as divided as this country that can make progress. That's why I want to \ncome with big ideas. Any leader that cannot secure its people has lost its right to lead. I'm going to achieve it as the \nperson who takes the job of the commander-in-chief seriously. In this country, we still have soldiers who I believe \nare the best in the world. If they are well armed, Boko Haram would not be a match for them. I'm talking of the kind \nof big ideas that would eliminate unemployment in the country, the kind of big ideas that if we call ourselves the \nbiggest oil producer in the continent we would not be importing oil.\n\n02.12\n\nSam Nda-Isaiah and Rochas Okorocha have also spoken to delegates. Mr. Okorocha spoke fervently about his \nyoung age of 52 and his views on free education. See excerpts of the two speeches below.\n\n02.08\n\nExcerpts from Kwankwaso's speech to delegates\n\nI congratulate the National Convention planning Committee for doing a good job. \"The environment has been made \nso good to allow the delegates to vote for persons whether they collect money or not. In the next few minutes, \nvoting will start and I belief the delegates will vote for the best aspirant to fly the flag of our party. From 2011, \neducation has been free at all levels in kano state. The government is feeding children in all public schools, five \ntimes a week.. We have the most lighted city in Nigeria today.. Kano was able to establish IPP which produce \n35MW for the city of Kano. With Kwankwaso as president, we will do whatever what it takes to move education \nforward. As a former Minister of Defence, I am wondering what is happening to our armed forces who were doing \nextremely well. Our administration will provide all that is needed to the armed forces to return its glory.. I will use my \nexperienced relationship as a legislature to work harmoniously with the Legislature.. As a former governor, I will \nalso work in harmony with all governors... Our administration will ensure the reduction of corruption. We have done \nit in Kano and I see no reason why we cannot do it at the centre... We will work hard to ensure peaceful co-\nexistence and stop our citizens from becoming refugees in their own country and neighbouring nations.. Delegates \nshould support the right candidate and I belief the right candidate is Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso.\n\n01.49\n\n\n\nBuhari spoke after Atiku.\n\nKnow that the hopes and destiny of Nigerians are with you and they expect you to play a credible role. I expect you \nto do the same. I seek to be the next president of our beloved nation because I feel I have something to offer our \ngreat nation at this time.. I am ready to lead Nigeria to its rightful future. I have always serve Nigeria to the best of \nmy ability.. I am not a rich person, thus I cannot give you dollars to purchase you, but the fate of this nation is not for \nsale.. What I will give you is my commitment, and service. For the past six years Nigeria has moved backward.. We \nare a nation afflicted by endless crisis. PDP cannot save us.. It is now time for change.. PDP government may say \nit needs more time and continuity, but what we need is change. To solve Nigeria's problems. we need leadership \nwith integrity and strength.. The next leader should not just mouth change but live it.. I own no foreign account or \ncompanies benefitting from government contracts.. I am what you see before you; a simple man who belief in \nserving Nigeria and God.. In the past I led a war against indiscipline. Today, I will lead a battle for hope.. You \ncannot trust the corrupt to end corruption. . Failure and incompetence does not deserve continuity.. Make no \nmistake as is always the case, for those who seek to bring change, it will not be easy.. I will govern Nigerian in \naccord with the constitution and rule of law.. I will tolerate no regional, religious or ethnic balance.. I will select the \nbest Nigerians in my government.\n\n01.39\n\nExcerpts from Atiku's speech\n\nBy the end of this convention, you would have elected a presidential candidate. That is not the main reason that I'm \nhere. Nigerians want change and they want change because they are fed up with the PDP government. They are \ntired of the crushing level of unemployment. They are tired of poor electricity. They are tired of the dangerous PDP \nmathematics, a dangerous maths where 16 is greater than 19. They are tired and disgusted by the siege of power \nand the tear gas of our speakers on the orders of the same executives that deceived the speaker to reconvene the \nassembly on issues of national importance. Nigerians are tired of the dead traps called road. They are tired of the \ncollapse of the public school system. You came here because you believe in change. You believe that our hopes \nand dreams can become a reality. You believe that our great country can set a standard for all of Africa to see. \nChange for a better Nigeria and Nigeria for all as the candidate of our great party in 2015. Today we would \ndemonstrate that every vote counts. The APC is offering something we have never had in a long time. We would \nhave the chance to replace a party with a party that knows what to do. A party that understands that education \nshould not only be accessible but delivers what it takes. The nominee you are about to elect must be a person \ntrusted by all across all ethnic groups in the country. Distinguished delegates, fellow Nigerians, I continue to speak \nout for democracy. I've been a successful entrepreneur creating jobs empowering men and women.\n\n01.34\n\nAtiku Abubakar has just finished his speech to the delegates where he told them that any of the aspirants is better \nthan the incumbent, Goodluck Jonathan. He wishes to be elected, claiming he has the qualities of a good leader, \nbut he asks the delegates to use their best judgement.\n\n01.25\n\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan has accepted the party's ticket. He also announced he will be re-running for the office \nwith his \"tested and loyal\" Vice President, Namadi Sambo, as his running mate.\n\n01.11\n\nWith the speech making over, all five aspirants appear on stage for a photo op before voting begins. As it appears, \nno aspirant stepped down for another.\n\n01.04\n\nYouth Leader, Dasuki Jalo, said today is historic because the APC will elect its first presidential candidate. He said \nthe Youtth will support whoever emerge as the candidate of the party in today's primary.\n\n\n\n00.52\n\nThe National Woman Leader of the APC, in her brief remark said the APC must get it right and urged the delegates \nto reflect deeply before casting their votes. \"We cannot afford to fail because history will be unkind to us if we do \"I \nurge the women of our great party to rise up to the challenge and make possible, democracy to take firm root in \nNigeria.\" \"remember the pains and agony of the thousands without jobs.\n\n00.50\n\nSenator Danjuma Goje in his brief remark said that what is happening tonight is an indication of the seriousness, \ndetermination and commitment of the APC to take over Government in 2015. \"I call on all our members not to be \nintimidated. Do like the people of Osun. Anywhere you go in this country, people are yearning for change because \nthey are fed up with insecurity and bad governance.\" Goje also called on the people to vote and protect their votes \nuntil results are announced. \"The convention we are witnessing today is the best organised since 1999\"\n\n00.49\n\nAudu Ogbe's goodwill speech followed Tinubu's.\n\nMr. Ogbe began by thanking the delegate for making it to Lagos to \"engage on debate, exchange views, descend \nand then ascend.\"\n\nHe also prayed to God that the best among the five aspirants emerge tonight.\n\nHe also welcomed his kinsman, Barnabas Gemade who recently joined the APC.\n\nHe asked the delegates if there is anyone that is so blind he cannot see the disaster coming.\n\nHe also asked if there is anyone deaf or unconscious than cannot see the biggest threat facing Nigerians as a \npeople.\n\n\"60% of our people below the age of forty have no jobs,\" he said.\n\n\"Oil is at per barrel and it is to stop this disaster that is before all of us that we are here.\n\n\"You are here to take one of the most important decisions of your life because we are going to win the election in \n2015.\n\n\"Once you make up your mind come and cast your vote.\n\n\"God bless all of you and as you go back after this convention give support to all leaders who will emerge\"\n\n00.43\n\nExcerpts from Tinubu's Speech\n\nTonight a special energy is in the air.

I called on Nigerian to make a choice of continuing the the way it has \nbeen in the past 16 years. if that is not desirable nigerian should vote for the APC. Nigeria should vote for the APC. \nThis is the first time that an opposition party controls 14 states and out of those 14 states we control the two most \npopulous Lagos and Kano.

As I welcome you to Lagos I'm welcoming you to \nchange. I welcome you back to the epicentre of nationalism. to the home of change. I welcome you back to where \nthe plan of nigerian was hatched as a place of possibility.\n\nBecause I believe that promises must be kept. The list of promises are long as the list of disappointments. if we go \nthrough some of these promises you will discover that none of them have been fulfiled.\n\nThere was promise to complete the Second Niger Bridge, there was a promise to resuscitate all industries in Kano. \nthere was a promise to reduce the importation of importation. There was the promise to complete the road leading \nto the Muritala Mohammed Airport.\n\nThere was a promise to complete Ilesha water scheme, there was a promise to play politics without bitterness. As if \nthe promises were not bad enough, they have lost parts of Nigeria and in spite of these that party and the president \nare coming back and making more promises.\n\nToday we all have the responsibility to replace promises to promises that can be actualised.\n\nOne man would have that opportunity to implement that manifesto and bring the change we desire. what we have \npromised to do is important. we gather to elect the potential leader for the most populous nation in Africa.\n\n\n\n23.40\n\nExcerpts from Ogbonnaya Onu's speech\n\nI'm very happy and highly honoured to stand before you on this special day that history is being made. For 16 \nyears, we have seen that the the problem they inherited they have been unable to solve them. A time for change \nhas come and APC is the vehicle which Nigeria will use for that change.

Report reaching us indicates that faced with eminent \ndefeat in the governorship primaries, some opportunistic politicians who have foisted their power on the people of \nthe state have dubiously devised a new plan to pick a Muslim governorship candidate from the Southern Senatorial \nZone on the pretext of satisfying the nebulous agitation for power shift. This is not only a slap on the integrity of the \nstate but a brazen attempt to subvert the democratic right and will of the people, This is the latest in the plethora of \nfrustrating plots to stop Alhaji Garba Umar from generously and democratically being elected as the PDP \ngubernatorial candidate in the state. While we are not against power shift, the constitutional power to take this \ndecision rest squarely with the electorates of Taraba State and not on a select group of privilege people plotting to \nsubvert the rights of the people, just to satisfy their personal interest. As far as we know, zoning political office is not \nconstitutional and therefore cannot be foisted on the state by desperate politicians pursuing their personal and \nhateful agenda. The right of every electorate to choose their leader is a sacred responsibility or duty and not at the \nwhims and caprices of any individual or group. We strongly believe that one day the governorship seat will move \nnaturally to any part of the state including the Southern zone, depending on the credibility of the candidates. The \nmembers of the People's Democratic Party PDP, in the state have already elected their delegates and the \ndelegates are poised to elect their candidates for election into various offices during the forth-coming general \nelections. This process which is guided by the Nigerian Constitution is uniform throughout the country and therefore \nthe right of every Taraban cannot be taken away under any guise as this will neither be tolerated nor accepted. We \ntherefore warn that we will neither accept nor tolerate any attempt to impose candidates on the people without \ngoing through the democratic process, as any attempt to do so will be resisted with every option available to us. \nThe beauty of democracy is to accord the people their right to elect candidates of their choice and not to narrow \ntheir choices to people who have not declared interest in contesting election let alone articulating any programme of \ndevelopment for the state. We wish to advise all aspirants to various offices to subject themselves to the electoral \nprocess instead of seeking to get to office through the window. We are also convinced that Tarabans are matured \nenough to decide the movement of political offices to various zones in the state, and at the appropriate time power \nwill shift to credible candidates in any part of the state.\n\n20.15\n\nSokoto\n\nFormer Sports Minister, Yusuf Suleiman, boycotts Sokoto State PDP governorship election primary, a statement \nsays.\n\n\n\n20.15\n\nADAMAWA\n\nVoting has been concluded, officials are now counting the votes in the Adamawa governorship primary holding at \nthe Old Parade ground, Abuja.

Otherwise, if allowed, it will amount to \ndeprivation and oppression of the electorate. In turn, this may bring about chaos and active or passive rebellion by \nmany people.\n\n\"Even when one does not feel a sense of worry for the PDP if it loses Cross River State to another Party in the \ngovernorship and general elections, it is time our political leaders learnt how to take decisions that would build our \ndemocracy than destroy it. Democracy is about more than holding elections.

In the last elections in 2011, we gave the PDP over 1.8million votes. This time, we challenge them \nto come and get such votes again let us see. This is the time to prove our point. Our delegates for this gubernatorial \nprimary election are 4,574. This is an opportunity to ensure that, we do not suffer any longer.\"\n\nThe APC leader in the state also commended Senator Magnus Abe and his Deputy Tele Ikuru for their sterling \nqualities and useful contributions to his administration, urging them to remain steadfast and committed to the party.\n\n\"That does not mean that, one of my bosom friends, Senator Magnus Abe is not qualified. There are two distinct \nRivers people I respect so much because of their intellect. They are Senator Magnus Abe and Odein Ajumogobia, \nSAN, but, it is unfortunate, Ajumogobia will not be allowed to win the PDP guber primaries. In the same way, I have \nmentioned that the Deputy Governor, Engineer Tele is also qualified. With my Deputy, I have never watched my \nback. If I am overseas or in London, and I called him to handle some assignments, he has been doing well beyond \nmy expectations. He is a man of due process,\" Mr. Amaechi noted.\n\nMr. Amaechi equally explained that, the choice of Hon. (Dr) Dakuku Adol-Peterside is hinged on the struggle for the \nreturn of the Soku oil wells bequeathed to Bayelsa State and the Etche oil well to Abia State being masterminded \nby the federal government.\n\n\"We have suffered long in the hands of the Federal government. All the oil wells in Soku, owned by the Kalabari \npeople have been taken away to Bayelsa State and that of Etche to Abia state. We will fight with everything to \ndeliver APC in the 2015 general elections. As APC faithful, I expect all of us to have Soku and Etche oil wells at the \nback of our minds. The oil wells belong to our people. When I leave office, I expect the next Governor to continue \nthe struggle for the return of the oil wells to our people, the Rivers people\", Mr. Amaechi explained.\n\nThe State chief Executive task the Military and the Police that will be deployed to monitor the 2015 general \nelections in the state to be neutral and ensure the protection of lives and property.\n\n\n\nMr. Amaechi advised the Military and the Police not to be partisan in politics as such attempt could be regarded as \nan act of impunity against civilians.\n\n\"I hear the PDP and the Federal government are planning to use the military and the Police to stop me from moving \naround during the 2015 general elections. I am the chief security officer of the state and if they stop me, you will see \nwhat will happen. The duty of the Military and the Police during the elections is to ensure protection of lives and \nproperty\", Amaechi said.\n\nHe further commended stakeholders and party faithful for choosing and giving automatic tickets to Assembly \nmembers in the All Progressives Congress, APC and advised those who lost out to remain steadfast in moving the \nparty forward.\n\nGovernor Amaechi used the opportunity to urge Rivers people to foster a free, fair and credible election in the 2015 \ngeneral elections, adding that their Permanent Voters Card is key in choosing credible candidates.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the APC Guber Primary election, Prince Austin Nweke thanked Governor Amaechi and \nparty faithful for making it easy for the panel to conduct the party primaries in an atmosphere devoid of rancour and \nacrimony.\n\n\"What Governor Amaechi and you, the APC supporters have done is a new step that has ushered in peace and \nharmony in the state. Without your earlier decision, it would have been difficult to conduct the Guber primaries. \nSome APC states have over 18 guber aspirants, but this committee or panel is overwhelmed by the decision taken \nby Governor Amaechi and the party.

You \nhave toiled hard and sweated for the good of the state,\" Mr. Tinubu said in the message read by party's Publicity \nSecretary in the state, Joe Igbokwe. \"You all have acquitted yourselves very well by selling your vision and not by \ntearing each other down.

Below is the full statement. \"The attention of the Prof. Steve \nTorkuma Ugbah has been drawn to a story in today's edition of Daily Telegraph to the effect that the Benue State \nChapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has barred him from the party's Governorship Primaries earlier \nscheduled for today, but which for some reason(s) as yet unknown to us, have been rescheduled for Tomorrow i.e. \n5th December, 2014.\n\n\"Ugbah, the party's governorship candidate in the 2011 guber-election, is the leading contender for the state APC \nticket.\n\n\"It is possible that the story is also in other dailies, but the one in Daily Telegraph attributes the origin of the story to \nthe State APC Chairman, Mr. Abba Yaro, and quotes him as saying Ugbah has been excluded from the race, and \nthat although he has bought his Nomination Form, and has been duly screened, Ugbah \"remains on his own.\"\n\nProf. Ugbah wishes to state categorically, unambiguously and unequivocally that:\n\n1. The story is not true.\n\n2. It is not only baseless, wicked and satanic, it is calculated to mislead his teeming supporters across the state who \nare gearing up to give him the party's nomination tomorrow or anytime the state EXCO permits one to be held.\n\n3. Abba Yaro has no power, authority and locus, either as the State Chairman of the APC and/or an individual, to \nstop, disqualify or bar Ugbah from contesting in our party's Primaries, now rescheduled for tomorrow, Friday \nDecember 5, 2014.\n\n4. There is no provision in our party's guidelines or constitution as well as the nation's constitution that gives Abba \nYaro (or anybody by whatsoever designation in the state EXCO) the power, right or privilege to disqualify/bar any \naspirant, least of all, an aspirant of Prof. Ugbah's calibre, who, besides purchasing and returning his Expression of \nInterest/Nomination Forms, has been duly screened and passed by the APC Governorship Screening Committee, \nsitting Ilorin, the Kwara state capital.\n\n\n\n5. First, he was refused the Nomination Form after paying the statutory fees on grounds of a bogus and non-\nexistent \"Handling fees). That pathetic attempt to extort money from him collapsed when the National Secretariat of \nthe party received Ugbah's nomination papers, and wished him luck. Today, it is this phoney statement about \nUgbah being debarred. It does not get weirder.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, Prof. Ugbah wishes to call on his teeming Delegates/party faithful as well as his \nsupporters and sympathizers across the other political parties to disregard the said story or stories, in totality, \nwhether they are in print or verbal.\n\nUgbah wishes to assure them, and very powerfully so, that he, Steve Torkuma Ugbah, the leading contender for the \ngovernorship ticket of our great party, remains very much in the race. These desperate antics only confirm him as \nthe candidate to beat.\n\nUgbah wishes to further assure his increasing army of supporters that the desperate, but doomed campaign to stop \nhim, at all cost and by all means possible, by Abba Yaro and/or the State EXCO, acting independently or following \nthe script of any god-father or god-mother, cannot stop his determined quest to vie for the nomination of his party so \nas to rescue both his party, the APC, and Benue state from 16 years of democratic misrule and arrested \ndevelopment.\n\nProf. Ugbah, who is only asking for a level playing ground from the state APC (which is not too much to ask), finds it \ncurious that Abba Yaro, an Idoma man from Zone C is not zoning the governorship slot to Zone C, but is spiritedly \nembarrassing the party with his morbid obsession with Ugbah or his unstoppable candidacy.\n\nSigned:\n\nSimon Imobo-Tswam\n\nMedia Adviser to: Prof. Steve Torkuma Ugbah\n\n16.12\n\nEnugu\n\nIn Enugu State, the state chapter of the party has adopted Okey Ezea as its consensus governorship candidate for \nthe 2015 election, party chairman, Ben Nwoye says. Mr. Ezea, who has contested and lost the Enugu governorship \npost in the past, is a multimillionaire maritime lawyer and shipping mogul\n\n16.08\n\nAkwa-Ibom\n\nThe contest in Akwa Ibom is between four aspirants: Mr. Udoedehe, who had contested the governorship of the \nstate on the party's platform in 2011, former Military Administrator of Rivers State and a guber candidate of the All \nNigeria Peoples Party, ANPP, Mr. Umana, the former SSG and an APC member of the House of Representatives, \nEmmanuel Ekpenyong.\n\n16.05\n\nNasarawa\n\nIn Nasarawa, late arrival of materials is delaying the governorship primaries\n\nA cross section of the delagates who spoke to PREMIUM TIMES complained that they arrived Lafia as early as \n7.30a.m believing that accreditation would commence at 8.30am as scheduled.\n\nIsaac Saleh of Keffi in Nasarawa West Senatorial District lamented the continued delay of the exercise as at \n1.30p.m.\n\n\n\nHe said that most delegates came with the hope of returning home today but that with the delay, it might not be \npossible.\n\n\"I was not prepared to stay till tomorrow but with what is going on, the exercise might be delayed till midnight.\"\n\nPREMIUM TIMES observed that the accreditation is taking place at three different places, according to senatorial \ndistrict.\n\nOn a visit to the stadium, where the West Senatorial District delegates are being accredited, at about 2.30pm, \nGovernor Umaru Tanko Almakura was seen addressing delegates.\n\nGovernor Almakura and three other aspirants namely James Angbazo, Reuben Audu, and Stanley Buba, are \ncontesting for the ticket of the party to contest the 2015 gubernatorial election in the state.\n\n16.03\n\nSokoto\n\nIn Sokoto, over 4000 APC delegates from the 23 LGAs of the state are now fully seated at the Shehu Kangiwa \nMemorial Stadium venue of the APC guber primaries. Binji LG has concluded voting. Next is Bodinga and Dange \nShuni LGs. Then Gada and Goronyo LGs will vote.\n\n16.02\n\nAkwa-Ibom\n\nIn Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, the accreditation of delegates has just commended at the Township Stadium \nalong Udo Umana Street. PREMIUM TIMES learnt the APC structure collapsed in the state after the devastating \nblow it got from the PDP-led government of Governor Godswill Akpabio. The party's gubernatorial candidate during \nthe 2011 general election, John Udoedehe, had lost many of his supporters to the PDP which had the economic \npower. But with the defection to the party of the former Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Umana Okon \nUmana, the party was revved to life. Mr. Umana is said to have brought into the party, his supporters and a robust \npolitical structure that cuts across every part of the state.\n\n15.58\n\nKANO\n\nThere are indications that one of the aspirants, Suleman Kawu, will withdraw from the governorship race in Kano \nany moment from now. Mr. Kawu, who is the Deputy Minority leader in the House of Representatives, is negotiating \nhis withdrawal from the race with some APC chiefs in the state. If he finally withdraws, the ticket will be contested \nfor by three others namely, the Deputy Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, former military governor of Kaduna State, \nJafaru Isa, and Usman Alhaji, a former finance commissioner in the state. Governor Rabi'u Kwankwaso has since \nendorsed his deputy.\n\n15.50\n\nKwara\n\nIn Kwara, Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed has been declared winner of the governorship primary. He was sole \ncandidate at the primary, and the election was mere formality. He addressed delegates after being declared winner, \npromising to do more for the state if reelected governor in February.\n\n15.45\n\nKano\n\n\n\nIn Kano the election will hold at the Sani Abacha Stadium at about 6pm. A total of 7,500 delegates will participate in \nthe election.\n\n15.40\n\nKwara\n\nIn Kwara, the election is going smoothly so far. Incumbent governor, Abdulfatah Ahmed, is expected to emerge.\n\n15.11\n\nAdamawa\n\nIn Adamawa state, delegates are presently queued at the Lamido Cinema venue of the election. The party's flag \nbearer in the cancelled Adamawa bye election, Mohammed Jibrilla, aka Bindow and his major contender, Ibrahim \nMijinyawa, aka Yayaji, are already at the venue.\n\n08.53\n\nAs Police Commissioner Danladi spoke with a PREMIUM TIMES reporter on telephone, loud sounds of gunshot \ncould be heard in the background.\n\n\"I'm sure you can hear the sound,\" he said. \"That tells you we are still under fire.\"\n\n08.50\n\n\"We are still under fire,\" the Yobe State Police Commissioner, Marcus Danladi, told PREMIUM TIMES when \ncontacted. \"Kindly sympathise with us. There is nothing I can tell you now.\"\n\n08.46\n\nA police officer, who does not want to be named told PREMIUM TIMES the gunmen invaded the town coming \nthrough Gujba town.\n\n\"They came through Gujba town and their first attack was the Police Mobile Force Base along Gujba road. We don't \nknow the details on casualty, but I fear it could be bad.\"\n\n08.42\n\nResidents say shootings have subsided and that everywhere is now quiet in Damaturu.\n\n\"We no longer hear the gunshots and blast anymore but the whole town is quiet except for the movement of \nvehicles that sound like military trucks\", said Yaya Haruna.\n\n08.18\n\nThe military personnel on ground in Damaturu are said to be careful in their response to the sudden attack.\n\nThey said they want to try as much as possible to avoid the shooting of civilians in their exchange of gunfire with \nthe terrorists.\n\n08.14\n\nAn Air Force jet has arrived Damaturu, and is engaging the Boko Haram fighters.\n\n\"We are hearing the sound of the jet fighter hovering the skies amid heavy sounds of explosions. We don't know \nwhat to do. We are still lying on the ground inside our room,\" said Yaya Haruna, a civil servant and resident of the \ncity.\n\n\n\n20.00\n\nThe Congo vs Sudan match ended 1 nil in favour of Congo. So Congo and South Africa qualifies for the finals.\n\n19.55\n\nFULL TIME Despite its late equalizer, Nigeria is out of the tournament. Good Night and thanks for following.\n\n19.53\n\nEnyeama saves Nigeria from a third goal.\n\n19.52\n\nGOOOOOOOOOOAL!!! Aluko equalizes for Nigeria. An extra time strike from about 30 yards.\n\n19.50\n\nFive minutes added time. Enough time for the Eagles to score the needed goals. But it might work against them as \nthe 10-men South Africans may snatch a break and add salt to the injury.\n\n19.47\n\nTwo minutes left to play and the desperation in the Nigerian side is at its peak. Coordination is low and chances are \nhard to convert.\n\n19.45\n\nIke Uche manages to sneak a shot through the many legs defending the South African goal, but the keeper was in \nhand to parry the low shot.\n\n19.43\n\nNigeria still pressing hard to score but the South Africans are defending effectively, playing only two men up. This \nstrategy appears to be working considering they are playing 10 against 11.\n\n19.40\n\n8 minutes left to play. South African strike on the floor and receiving medical attention.\n\n19.35\n\nAzubieke gets first booking for Nigeria -77'mins.\n\n19.32\n\nNigeria pressing hard this time. Omeruo out for Aaron Samuel. Nigeria hopes to score at least two more.\n\n19.31\n\nWill Nigeria make the most of the one-man advantage.. clock tickling down down 73' minutes gone.\n\n19.30\n\nSouth African player, on jersey 12, gets a red. A second yellow card on the 71st minute. A chance for Nigeria to \npour in more goals.\n\n19.28\n\n\n\nNigeria needs two more goals to enlist.\n\n19.27\n\nGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!!! Nigeria scrambles one into the South African net. The Sub Sone Aluko shoots in a \nrebound from an Ike Uche strike. Nigeria 1-2 South Africa\n\n19.26\n\nNigeria has barely 24 minutes to salvage this unpalatable situation... Meanwhile it's still Sudan 0-2 Congo, Nigeria \nare condemned to win this game or else..\n\n19.24\n\n25 minutes left to play. Nigeria still down by 2 goals to nil. Meanwhile, in the other match, Congo is leading Sudan \nby 1 nil.\n\n19.20\n\nEvents turning worse for Eagles as crowd begin to turn against them inside the Uyo stadium. More support is \nactually required now\n\n19.18\n\nRaheem Lawal pulled out for Sone Aluko. Will the Hull City man make and difference for Nigeria?\n\n19.17\n\nNice header from Emenike But straight into the arms of the South African goalkeeper.\n\n19.08\n\nA nice goal from the scorer of the first. The goal came off a defensive error by Omeruo, our number 4 man.\n\n19.07\n\nGOAL! It appears Nigeria's fate is sealed. South Africa scores again. This time, early in second half. Nigeria 0-2 \nSouth Africa.\n\n18.50\n\nEnd of first half. Nigeria down by one goal. South Africa came from behind in possession and attempts to stun the \nEagles with a fantastic strike.Nigeria would have to equalize and win this match to be eligible for a chance to \ncontest for the AFCON 2015 ticket.\n\n18.46\n\nNigeria will have to come from behind to beat South Africa, win the match and contest for a ticket to Equatorial \nGuinea.\n\n18.43\n\nGOAL! South Africa draws the first blood. South Africa came from the defensive to take the lead. NIgeria 0-1 South \nAfrica\n\n18.41\n\n\n\nSouth Africa appears to be getting ready for a defensive. A striker in Jersey 13, removed for a defender, in jersey 6. \n38\"\n\n18.36\n\nIke Uche had two instances where he refused to pass the ball, perhaps he didn't look the other way, and had full \nconcentration on the post. He missed it! 31\"\n\n18.35\n\n33\" minutes played so far. The Nigerians now lead in attempts and possession. But goal line is still 0-0.\n\n18.30\n\nBafana Bafana's former captain and number one goalkeeper, Senzo Muyiwa, was murdered last month in South \nAfrica. The team adorned a black wrist band in his honour during their match against Sudan last Saturday. Darren \nKeet has taken his place with his third cap today, against Nigeria.\n\n18.29\n\nThe fans are now demanding \"one goal'. They are chanting the familiar \"all we are saying... give us one goal...\"\n\n18.28\n\nAhmed Musa has been fantastic so far. He appears high in spirit and speed.\n\n18.27\n\nIke Uche, with Ahmed Musa free on his left near the goal area, shot directly to the arms of the South African \ngoalkeeper.\n\n18.21\n\nThe South African goalkeeper is down. Medics are rushing his way.\n\n18.19\n\nAhmed Musa, playing from central forward just missed a second and third close chance. He has been tormenting \nthe South African in the past 10 minutes. But he still needs a classical touch to his finishing. Nigeria likely to score \nsoon as the pressure on South Africa mounts.\n\n18.18\n\nIn the sixth minute, there was a great attempt by Mikel Obi blocked by the South African defence.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom International stadium is about 70% full, an improvement in attendance in match attendance in \nNigerian football\n\n18.14\n\nAn Ahmed Musa strike is blocked by the South Africans. Nigeria gets its first corner kick. Kick taken by Mikel Obi, \nbut it was too strong and over-sped the goal area.\n\n18.12\n\nSo far, 10\", it is goaless bt South Africa has had three attempts on goal. Nigeria lags with one.\n\n18.11\n\n\n\nA corner to the Bafana Bafana. It is the first of this match. It has been taken, but safely headed into the arms of \nVincent Enyeama.\n\n18.10\n\nThe match is now underway. Ninety anxious minutes stand between Nigeria and qualification for 2015 AFCON\n\n18.09\n\n7\" Ahmed Musa opens opportunity for Nigeria. Hits the crossbar.\n\n18.09\n\n5 minutes into the match, South Africa have had the upper hand. The first strike, at 3\" saw the Bafana Bafana miss \na goal by the whiskers.\n\n18.06\n\nIn other matches\n\nDRC 3-1 Sierra Leone The Leopards finish 3rd in Group D and currently the third best placed team.\n\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire 0-0 Cameroon The Elephants finish second in Group D & qualify for Equatorial Guinea 2015\n\nGroup F: Cape Verde and Zambia are through. The Blue Sharks, also group winners. Mozambique & Niger out of \nrunning for #AFCON 2015\n\nGroup G: Tunisia, Senegal already qualified\n\n17.57\n\nPlayers of both sides are on the pitch, lined up. National anthems of both sides have been sung. Time for the \nshowdown proper.\n\n17.37\n\nSuper Eagles in high spirits but need Lady Luck - Keshi\n\nSuper Eagles Coach, Stephen Keshi has said that the spirit in camp is very high and that he has urged the players \nto play like they did in Congo last Saturday.\n\n\"I think it's the spirit that we had in Congo,\" he told journalists today in Uyo. \"We need lady luck to be on our side \nand complete the whole situation, I know the boys are ready to go. They know what is at stake.\"\n\nHe also expressed his regret over Hope Akpan who had to leave the camp for England due to the shoulder injury \nhe picked during an away match in Congo this past weekend.\n\n\"We will miss him, but I think we have other players that can do the thing but I would have love him to be here. But \nthis is football and it happens!\" he said.\n\n17.14\n\nSouth Africa can also cause an upset as they have never beaten Nigeria. They will definitely want to make history: \nnot just beating Nigeria but doing so Nigeria at home. And bottom placed Sudan as well will want to make a point: \ngetting maximum points from their match with the Red Devils of Congo.\n\n17.03\n\n\n\nNigeria will likely qualify only if they beat South Africa comfortably as any goal by Congo in the other group game \nagainst Sudan could lead to the Eagles not qualifying for the tournament on goal difference rule.\n\nWe can only hope that Sudan, which sits below the table, would beat Congo.\n\n17.00\n\nIt's less than an hour to kick-off in Uyo. The statistics are sure in favour of the Super Eagles who have beaten \nSouth Africa in all their home games played in the country. 1992 - 4-0 2000 - 2-0 2004 - 4-0 2008 - 2-0\n\n16.50\n\nPre-Match analysis\n\nNigeria has an enormous striking force which can cause major upset for the Bafana Bafana. The defence line of \nSouth Africa will be on the lookout for these players because any major mistake could prove lethal.\n\nIkechukwu Uche's return to the Eagles squad could pay off at the end for the Super Eagles as his form with his \ncurrent club is highly unprecedented and he could likely cause an upset.\n\nEmenike cannot be written off as well. His strength can throw the South African defenders off balance.\n\nIn the Eagles' rank also is the former Kano Pillars and current CSKA Moscow winger, Ahmed Musa, whose elegant \ncross can find the foot of Emenike, and he can likely find the back of the net as well.\n\nThe new kid on the block, Aaron Samuel, has impressed so far for the Eagles and may be looking to establish \nhimself in Keshi's squad as a starter instead of the super-sub role he currently enjoys.\n\n16.19\n\nHead Coach Stephen Keshi has made two changes in the Super Eagles starting lineup for Wednesday's clash \nagainst South Africa. Kenneth Omeruo and Raheem Lawal are the only two players that did not start the game \nagainst Congo that have now been given the nod for the must-win clash against the South Africans. As expected \ngoalkeeper Vincent Enyeama is leading the Eagles while Ik Uche and Emmanuel Emenike are leading the attack as \nthe reigning African champions gun for goals. Eagles XI vs Bafana Bafana. Enyeama, Efe, Omeruo, Egwuekwe, \nOshaniwa; Onazi, Lawal, Mikel; Uche, Musa, Emenike\n\n15.51\n\nKeshi makes two changes for Bafana clash\n\n17.38\n\nMission accomplished..

Get the full declaration speech here.\n\n14.15\n\nThe declaration event is formally brought to an end with the national anthem.\n\n14.12\n\nThe president has rounded off his speech. He is escorted back to the VIP section by his wife and multitude of aides, \npolitical associates and supporters. Compared to his past deliveries, his presentation today is a lot smoother and \nassertive. It was a long speech but he was able to wade through it slowly, and without losing steam.\n\n14.10\n\nIt appears the sound system broken down shortly after the president's declaration. A lot From where I stand in the \ncrowd, I can't hear the President any longer. With the sound system dysfunctional, many people in here are barely \nlistening to the president. Many are engrossed in other activities.\n\n14.07\n\nBuried deep in the lengthy speech is the key declaration of the day. \"After seeking the face of God and quite \nreflection with my Family..., I Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, has accepted to present myself\" for the contest for \nthe 2015 general elections, Jonathan announces to a cheering crowd. The crowd just won't stop cheering ... By this \nwords, the President has thrown his hat into the ring. The race begins... This is what the mammoth crowd here \ncame to hear.\n\n14.04\n\n\n\nThe president recounted how he, the governors of Lagos and Rivers, and all Nigerians united to fight Ebola. He \nrecalled how he declared a state of emergency and called for national action when Ebola came to Nigeria and that \nwith the cooperation of all Nigerians, the nation was able to successfully contained the disease. \"Just as we \nstopped Ebola, we are on our way to eradicating polio in Nigeria,\" Mr. Jonathan said as the crowd roared. \"I \npromise that I will not handover polio to anyone.\"\n\n14.02\n\nHe said he has established 14 new Universities out of which two are specialised. \"Under my watch, every Nigerian \nstate has a Federal University,\" he said. He said he has established 150 almajiri schools in the north.\n\n13.59\n\nHe said the Dangote group has invested one billion dollars on rice production and that in five years, \"Nigeria will \nbecome a net exporter of Rice.\" He said the government is encouraging high school students to begin to see agric \nas a commercial venture. He said he has eradicated corruption in the agric sector and that that success would be \nextended to other sectors. He said going forward, he would double his effort in the fight against corruption and that \ncorrupt government officials would begin to face justice.\n\n13.49\n\nHe said his government has succeeded in eliminating long queue in filling stations through consistent provision of \npetroleum products to Nigerians. He said the private sector is investing bn in the petrochemical sector as a result of \nhis government's favourable policy. He said his government has revolutionised the Agric sector by transforming it \ninto a business. \"We ended the case of corruption in the fertiliser and seed supply chain,\" he said. He said 14 \nmillion farmers, out of which two millions are women, have accessed fertiliser through the e-wallet system \nintroduced by government.\n\n13.46\n\nMr. Jonathan said he has started a revolution in the Housing sector that will enable millions of Nigerians to become \nfirst time House owners. He said 66,000 mortgage requests from young Nigerians are already being processed. \nHe said 10 new districts are being developed in the FCT and that very soon Nigerians will start using the light rail \nfrom the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport to the city centre.\n\n13.44\n\nHe said his government has completed the dredging of the River Niger from Baro in Niger state to Warri in Delta \nstate. He said he made a commitment to build two new major bridges across the Rivers Niger and Benue and that \nwork is at advance stages on the two bridges.\n\n13.41\n\nPresident Jonathan also thanked all the organs of the party for adopting him as the sole candidate of the party. He \nsaid his government has pursued a power sector reform to \"an irreversible progress\". He also said additional Hydro \npower stations are being built in Zungeru and Mambila. He said he has released N60bn for the Africa Green project \nand that tremendous progress had been made, with 37 new dams built. He said various intervention in the \nirrigation sub sector has led to about N45bn revenue. Mr. Jonathan also enumerated the various progress made on \nthe railway sector. \"Very soon, people can stay in Kaduna and work in Abuja with the completion of the Abuja-\nKaduna standard gauge,\" he said.\n\n13.39\n\nPresident Jonathan said he remains grateful for the trust reposed on him by Nigerians. He also said he is grateful \nto Nigerians for their understanding over the handling of the difficult insecurity challenges. He pledges to defeat \n\n\n\nterror and also said the kidnapped Chibok girls would be released. He said through the Safe School Initiative and \nvictim support fund, his government has set aside N60bn to aide the victims of terror.\n\n13.33\n\nJonathan thanks Nigerians and party members for the support just before calling for a one-minute silence for \nstudents killed in a suicide bomb attack on Government Science Secondary School in Potiskum on Monday. One \nminute over, the president declared, \"May their souls rest in peace,\" and the crowd sat back. The president admits \nterrorism is a challenge and promises to bring back the Chibok schoolgirls who were taken hostage in April.\n\n13.27\n\nAt the stage, Jonathan adjusts his glasses, his speech papers, and did some more hand-waving to the crowd as a \nsong by Onyeka Onwenu, Run, Jonathan Run, blares through the speakers.\n\n13.24\n\nMr. Sambo pledges his loyalty and calls on the president to come on stage to declare his ambition. Jonathan hugs \nhis wife before departing for the podium.\n\n13.21\n\nPresident Jonathan is in a deep conversation with his wife and a third party as the Vice President delivers his \nspeech. The president repeatedly slices the air, horizontally, with his right hand, through the conversation.\n\n13.18\n\nThe Vice President, Namadi Sambo, would speak next. He left his position as governor of Kaduna state to join \nJonathan shortly after the later took office in 2010 following the death of Umaru Yar'Adua. He is expected to pledge \nhis loyalty and underline the achievements of the Jonathan administration of which he is part. He is likely to remain \nthe Vice President if Jonathan wins.\n\n13.14\n\nThe senate president apparently led all PDP members of the National Assembly to the event. The speaker of the \nHouse of Reps recently decamped to the opposition All Progressives Congress. The senate president asked the \npresident to heed the call by Nigerians and run for a second term. He said all over the world, performing \ncandidates are endorsed to run for second terms. He said everyone in the country must come together and support \nthe president o overcome the challenges of insecurity posed by the Boko Haram sect\n\n13.10\n\nPresident Jonathan has sat calmly in the VIP section listening to these speeches. At times, he smiles. At times, he \nis expressionless. But he must be a very happy man today. He could have wished for a larger crowd at his \ndeclaration ceremony.\n\n13.07\n\nThe senate president said Nigerians want a president who can be trusted, who is reliable and inspiring, and that \nJonathan is that president. He said the if he fails to return, the tangible projects he started might not see the light of \nthe day. \"We trust and believe you can deliver the dividends of democracy to Nigeria,\" he said.\n\n13.00\n\nDavid Mark, the senate president is next on stage. But before that, Nigeria star rapper, Naeto C sings a stage \nversion of his Ten Over Ten, for the president.\n\n\n\n12.57\n\n\"Mr. President do not be intimidated and we are solidly behind you. Those who are behind are more than those \nagainst you,\" Akpabio said. Akpabio ended his speech saying: \"We cannot handover Nigeria to the enemies of \nProgress\".\n\n12.56\n\nGodswill Akpabio, governor of Akwa Ibom state led the PDP Governors to the podium. He said \"We field \ncommanders (Governors)\" will ensure the PDP gets 30 states. He said they were the first to notice Jonathan's \ntransformation efforts in railways, power, agriculture, power, and economy. He said after the recognisance, the \nPDP Governors decided not to contest against him. He admits the road to the 2015 election will be tough but said \nthey will emerge victorious. \"Those who are behind you are more than those who are against you,\" he said. He \nsaid the opposition have no plan for Nigeria and accused them of plotting to destabilise nigeria and encouraging \nterror. He is flanked by the PDP Governors as he speaks.\n\n12.53\n\nGodswill Akpabio: \"Dr. Goodluck Ebelo Jonathan, we PDP Governors are saying \"carry go\".

But many of the president's critics disagree. They say he has failed to check the growing \ninsurgency in the country, that electricity supply in the country has worsened under his reign, that kidnapping and \nabductions have heightened; that unemployment has skyrocketed. Mr. Jonathan is most likely to use this occasion \nto respond to his critics. He is most likely going to showcase his achievements in the past three years too.\n\n11.54\n\nThe President has returned to the VIPS stand After his tour. After a brief exchange of pleasantries with dignitaries \nat the VIP section, the national anthem is sang, paving way for the declaration speeches.\n\n11.48\n\nBefore today, former Head of State, Muhammadu Buhari [APC], former Vice President Atiku [APC] and Governor \nRabiu Kwankwaso [APC] have declared their presidential ambition in Abuja.

Security personnel \nhave now closed the main entrance to the Square, asking people to go and sit in one of the large tents outside the \nSquare and monitor proceedings on the three giant screens provided. People are however adamant they want to go \nin. A lot of people are pushing to get in. The President could not have wished for more than this mammoth crowd.\n\n21.13\n\nFinal score Nigeria 2-0 Cameroon.

He also said there is rampant corruption \ncases even before the Senate and that Nigeria needs someone like Buhari to the rescue. Melaye closed the event \nby saying all are expected to return by May 2015 for the inauguration of GMB as president.\n\n14.10\n\nWe in APC have pledge to bring change to Nigeria. Agricultural productivity and taking out poverty and proving food \nsecurity will be a focal point. We will restore honour and integrity to public service and also tackle corruption \n\"Nigeria is now a country where stealing is not corruption\".\n\n14.04\n\n\"There is no point in holding election if it is not free and fair\" Whether PDP likes it or not, injustice cannot endure. \nNigeria has never been so polarised by a sinking government We in APC have resolved to stop them in their track. \nThere is now general insecurity in the land, Boko Haram, armed robbery, kidnapping e.t.c.\n\nThe economy continues to degenerate while government continues to announce fantastic figures and fathom \neconomic growth.\n\n13.57\n\nGMB began his speech by paying tribute to Nigerians who are grappling with poverty and insecurity \"due to \ninsurgencies by Godless people in the name of Boko Haram, marauding murders in communities and kidnappers.\" \nHe also commended the armed offices and the police in their efforts to return peace to the country urging them to \n\n\n\n\"continue until victory is won\" \"I humbly wish to present you, before all Nigerians and before God seeking to be \nelected as APC presidential candidate,\" GMB said.\n\n13.54\n\nMr. Ogbe also dispelled rumours that GMB is a religious fanatic, saying that if he was a fanatic, himself, and \nAmaechi, Oshiomhole, Oyegun who are all christians will have nothing to do with him. He said God brought \neveryone together for a reason. He described GMB as a quiet and rational human who \"had power but never \nabused it\" He said GMB is a man of unusual character who has to run for office because Nigeria is in serious \ntrouble-Terrorism in the North East and high level corruption- which is being covered under propaganda. He said \nNigeria needs Buhari and the other APC candidates. \" we send out greetings and sympathy to the people of the \nNorth East  and the parents of the Chibok girls. \"We commend the people behind the #BringBackOurGirls. We \nunderstand the government is planning to take them to court, let the court room be large enough to accommodate \nall of us. Mr. Ogbe now invited GMB to be accompanied by other VIP's to come to the podium and give his \ndeclaration speech\n\n13.40\n\nGovernor Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers state, speaking on behalf of other governors said change is in the air.

He also said it was \nwrong for the PDP and the President to take credit for the fight against Ebola. \"Apart from announcing the number \nof casualties, what have they done for us\". \"Kano, Lagos and Rivers is not in their hands, tell me how they will win. \nWe will give them the Osun treatment,\" he said. He also called on all APC members to make sure they have their \nvoters card so that \"whoever emerge as our party candidate we will vote for him.\". He also recalled that President \nJonathan said in 2013 that he was the most abused president but that by the following year Nigerians will dance \nand praise his name because they will have enough power. \"Are you praising him and do you have power?\" Mr. \nAmaechi asked. Next to speak is the coordinator of GMB's campaign Audu Ogbe who said we discussed the crisis \nof the youth last night and we have concluded that \"we must find you jobs\". Mr. Ogbe went ahead to read a brief \nbiography of GMB\n\n13.27\n\nGeneral Buhari was a Federal Commissioner for Petroleum; Chairman, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation; \nGovernor of North-Eastern State; Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces; Chairman, \nPetroleum Trust Fund [PTF]; three-time presidential candidate [twice for the All Nigeria Peoples Party, ANPP, and \nonce for the Congress for Progressive Change, CPC]. This is his fourth time of aspiring for president.\n\n13.26\n\nMelaye \" APC is a very responsible party, a member just found a large sum of money and has brought it to us, so \nwhoever lost money should approach us\".\n\nProfessor Isa Odidi speaking on behalf of APC members in the diaspora said Nigeria is faced with extra ordinary \ncircumstances and there is the need for an extra ordinary leader to solve them.\n\nHe said GMB epitomises the qualities of an extra ordinary leader and urged \"all Nigerians to take back your \ncountry\".\n\n13.21\n\nAlso speaking on behalf of the youth is Comrade Jasper who said various promises of employment have been \nmade since 1999 but such promises were never kept. He said GMB initiated and signed for Nigeria's two existing \nrefineries. He urged the youth to vote for him so that he will come back and build more. He also recalled the \nwonderful days of PTF and stated that many roads in the South East are in bad shape and that \"Jonathan laid \n\n\n\nfoundation for the second Niger bridge two times that is the road I pass to go to my village, there is no single brick \nbeing laid in the name of second Niger bridge. All this things you are doing to us Jonathan, there is God o!\" Jasper \nsaid.\n\n13.17\n\nMelaye \"we are here to stop those who said there is a difference between stealing and corruption, we are here to \nstop those who said they had no shoe to deceive Nigerians, General Buhari had a shoe\" Speaking on behalf of \nwomen is Rabi Ishaq said. Nigerian women should respond to the call by the APC. She said Nigerians yearn for \nand must get change. \"We are here to endorse our one and only GMB who has always stood for the good of all. \n\"Women of Nigeria you are the voters, and you have voted in rulers and not leaders. It is time you vote in leaders\" \" \nWe belief GMB can change most of the ills we have in Nigeria within the shortest possible time. Please support our \none and only Mandela. He has no parallel,\" she said.\n\n13.16\n\nNext is goodwill message from various institutions. First to speak is Senator Olorumimbe Mamora on behalf of the \nelders of the APC. He said there is a wind of change that is blowing and that an idea whose time has come, no one \ncan stop it. He said there is no doubt that an APC government will be in place next year. He said the country \ncannot afford to continue with insecurity and economic deprivation. \"We have to work to achieve success,\" he said. \nAlso speaking, on behalf of Senators is the former Governor of Benue state, George Akume. Mr. Akume said the \nNational Assembly had a very exciting session with General Buhari last night. He said they asked Mr. Buhari how \nhe will manage the Oil industry, adding that if his response is relayed to the gathering \"you will all weep for this \ncountry\". Mr. Akume also said the APC is richly endowed with the great human Resources anyone can find in any \npart of the world. He said his point is buttressed by the way various aspirants under the APC are campaigning \nwithout recourse to abuses. \"Difference without division, rivalry in fellowship,\" he said.\n\n13.09\n\nGeneral Buhari is making a fresh bid to return to power more than 29 years after he was ousted as military head of \nstate by his then Chief of Army Staff, Ibrahim Babangida. A strict disciplinarian, Mr. Buhari chased the Shehu \nShagari civilian regime from power on December 31, 1983. On August 27, 1985, Babangida and his fellow coup \nplotters sacked him, locking him up for years. His mother died while in detention.\n\n13.02\n\nThe former Governor of Bayelsa state, Timipre Sylva, giving the welcome address, said Nigeria's economy today \nneeds revamping. He said security situation is in dire need of resuscitation and that the over 200 girls from Chibok \nare still somewhere no one knows. He said Nigeria's problems are well known, but that there is good news \nbecause the solution to Nigeria's problems is at Eagle Square today, General Muhammadu Buhari. He also said \nBuhari has occupied almost all cadre of offices, but is running for office again because of Nigerians and not himself. \n\"We are very happy that he has decided to come out of retirement to help us stabilise this country, so that the \nyounger ones can carry on with the development of this nation,\" he said. For those who say Buhari is too old, he \nsaid \"we are not going to talk about age in this campaign because we don't want to be accused of using the \ninexperience of our opponent. \"Buhari brings experience and Integrity to this campaign. He is a man of the people \ntoday and he will be the president of the People come 14 February 2015,\" Mr. Sylva concluded.\n\n12.55\n\nAudu Ogbeh, a former National Chairman of the PDP, opened the event with a word of prayer.\n\nMr. Ogbeh, a farmer and intellectual, is coordinating Mr. Buhari's campaign.\n\nHe left the PDP after then President Olusegun Obasanjo shoved him aside for daring to write a letter criticising \nsome of Mr. Obasanjo's political tactics at the time [including the abduction of a sitting governor, Chris Ngige].\n\n\n\n12.51\n\n12.44\n\nAs Mr. Buhari passes in front of our stand, an overwhelmed supporter sitting beside me said, \"Are you sure this \nman is a human being? oh General!\" Another elderly guy near him was busy weeping!\n\n12.36\n\nBuhari finally arrives.\n\n12.28\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_169515\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"526\"] The stage is set for Gen.

Mrs. Tinubu's presence appears to strengthen \n\n\n\nspeculation that her husband is pitching tent with General Buhari to pick the APC ticket. But she might have been \nthere on her own accord as well.\n\n12.01\n\nAlthough Buhari is the one declaring today, his posters and banners are competing side by side with various \naspirants nationwide at the Eagle Square Abuja.\n\n12.36\n\nAtiku is now joined by friends and leaders of his party, All Progressive Congress. Senator George Akume, Minority \nleader in the senate, speaks first, in solidarity with the aspirant.\n\n12.33\n\nQuotes from Atiku's declaration speech In spite of the many challenges we face, it is quite remarkable that our \npeople have refused to give up on Nigeria It is inspiring that amidst difficulties and growing anxiety over the future of \nour country, our people have refused to succumb to despair and hopelessness. This never say die attitude gives \nme immense hope and it is one of the reasons why I can never give up on Nigeria. The glaring mismatch between \nour potentials and achievements has become for many a frustrating puzzle; for others it is a topic for national \ndebate; and yet for another group, it is doomsday lament. But as a progressive and open minded Nigeria, I consider \nit a golden opportunity and a bitter sweet chance to display our courage, rekindle our innovative instinct, showcase \nour character and turn the Nigerian dream into reality.\n\n12.27\n\n\"Our country seems to be in auto-pilot with no one in charge\" Atiku continues in his speech, stopping intermittently \nto receive hails and cheers from the crowd.\n\n12.24\n\nAtiku began his declaration speech saying \"As I go round Nigeria, I listen to citizens voicing out their concerns and \nfrustrations.\"\n\nHe strongly recognizes the youth. \"Please follow me in giving three Gbosas to our youth. My story is similar to that \nof many of my generation.

The speech is expected to contain reasons he is running and how he intends to solve the \nhitherto listed national problems.\n\n12.05\n\nSome of the guests (youth) are called on to the stage to give short speeches, describing their personal problems \nand linking their challenges to how Nigeria have deteriorated over time.\n\nThe first speaker drew inspiration from Chinua Achebe's book: There Was a Country. \"Indeed, there was a coutry,\" \nhe said as he recounted how the Nigeria deteriorated with time. He eulogised Atiku and called on Nigerians to \nsupport him for purposeful leadership.\n\n\n\nThe second speaker, a lady, speaks at least three Nigerian languages. She gave a run down of the present security \nchallenges In the country and asked all Nigerians to support Atiku for adequate security.\n\nThe lady spoke in Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba and said \"I love this country and I want what is good for it, I believe \neveryone do the same,\" she said.\n\nThe third speaker, from Warri in Delta state, spoke in pidgin English. He said \"poor man no fit stay Abuja and dey \nsay we are one Nigeria, I must speak my mind' we for Warri need leaders not dealers\"\n\n11.47\n\nAtiku promises change. A future where stealing government funds is a punishable crime. Series of documentaries \ntouching on all points where Nigeria needs change is shown to the guest. The first documentary examined the \nproblems - Insecurity, energy dearth, employment, education, health, infrastructure, etc. The second documentary \nfeatures Atiku and explains how he would solve Nigeria's problems. \"I am Atiku Abubakar, together, we can build a \nNigeria for all!\" the second documentary ended.\n\n11.32\n\nA cultural troupe, Ebony Theatre is now entertaining guests, after various youth organisations who support Atiku's \nambition across Nigeria were recognized.

Thanks for following.\n\n13.09\n\nSamson Itodo just gave a message to the SA to the president on Job creation, Mrs Joesphine Washima-Attah.\n\nA message to President Goodluck Jonathan\n\n\"Please tell the president to make sure that bombs stop taking off by providing employment to the youth, tell him to \nprosecute all corrupt government officials who ask unemployed youth to pay N200,000 to be employed, tell him also \nthat those he promised compensation after the NIS job stampede have not seen any compensation up to now o!\"\n\n12.32\n\nSpeaking now is Samson Itodo, the Head of Research at YIAGA Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth & \nAdvancement.\n\nMr. Itodo commended previous speakers who represent government agencies for their 'sincere comments'.\n\nHe also said it is good the report is coming now because it poses a huge challenge to government on job creation \ninitiatives.\n\nHe said certain concepts such as coordination needs to be redefined \"It is a often question of who holds the money \nand who disburses the money\" he said.\n\nThe solution is to prosecute corrupt officials that politicise job creation initiatives. He recalled the job interview that \nled to the death of many Nigerians recently and the government appear to be playing lip service to the matter.\n\nHe said the National Assembly had directed that no government agency charge job seekers, yet it continues \nunabated. He asked the SA to the President to relay these to him in case he is not aware.\n\nHe said government Institutions must learn to respect the law of the land. He said most government agencies \nrefuse to adhere to requests made based on the Freedom of Information Act. He said for any policy to work, \ninteraction should start with the local populace first before any 'elitist summit\". He said the top to bottom approach \nof government in Nigeria is not working and there is the need for a rethink.\n\nHe also said the apparent polarization that pervades the country is also inhibiting the implementation of any policy. \nAdded to that he said, is the lack of information from the government to the people.\n\nHe said part of the problem of the Youth Council is that many people who have overgrown the age of being a youth \nprefers to remain there \"as if it is their birth right\".\n\nHe also said the issue of funding of the council through the Youth Ministry is another problem. He said the Youth \nCouncil needs an autonomous source of funding.\n\n12.27\n\n\n\nNext to speak is the Secretary General of the National Youth Council, Saleh Kubah.\n\nMr. Kubah also commended NSRP for an honest report. He said this is the first time he is coming across a report \nthat is sincere in its findings.\n\nHe said there is serious lack of confidence by the youth and that is because the youth are not involved as a body. \nHe said his organisation has been balkanized by politicians with vested interests in controlling the body.\n\nHe said any programme for employment that is merely a palliative and intervention, it will fade out. He said such \nprogrammes should be tied to the nations long term economic goals\n\nHe said most of the initiatives had not helped in mitigating violent conflicts because of the competition for power by \npoliticians and the youth are use as the vehicle for that.\n\nHe said rather than decrease, the interventions actually exacerbate the conflicts.\n\nLike others who spoke before him, Mr. Kubah identified the lack of synergy among the agencies involved jobs as \nleading cause of negative data. He said states are not keying in on these programmes. He said states are simply \nstealing proceeds from SURE-P and the programme is only implemented at the Federal level while majority of \nthose targeted by the programme reside in the states.\n\nHe said governors now find it convenient to set up vigilante group as intervention scheme which turn out to actually \nlead to violence.\n\nHe said the President has laudable programmes for youth development but their is no outcome because of the \nlapses by agencies involved. \"I see no reason why the Ministry of Finance will be running a Youth Development \nprogramme\" he said.\n\nHe advocated for a unified Youth Council to partner with government to mobilise the youth for national \ndevelopment.\n\n\"As I speak with you now, we have five persons parading themselves as the President of the youth council\" he \nsaid.\n\nHe said there is the need for a declaration of emergency on the unemployment sector.\n\n11.56\n\nNext to speak is Mr. Mangset the Director Enterprise Development and Promotion, Federal Ministry of Youth \nDevelopment.\n\nMr. Mangset said the Ministry made contributions to the research and also the study came at the right time \nbecause it touched on almost all the issues that his Ministry is working on. He identified data generated as one of \nthe key things that will aid the Ministry. He hopes the report will not be locked away like many others in the past.\n\nHe said the report also shows that majority of the youth in Nigeria are in the rural areas and the fact that most f the \nprogrammes are politicized, the target beneficiaries are often left out.\n\nHe said the president cannot be everywhere, and urged those in positions of authority to sit up and do their jobs \ndiligently.\n\nHe gave example with the Youwin Programme that requires applicants to apply online saying \"many of the target \nbeneficiaries do not have access to the internet\".\n\nHe said most agencies working on job creation do so independently and the lack of coordination and synergy is \nhindrance the success of the programmes.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody wants to coordinate, but no one wants to be coordinated\" he said He said politicization as identified in \nthe report is a key factor that also hinders job creation.\n\nHe said policies are developed without taking the beneficiaries taken into consideration. He said beneficiaries \nshould be part and parcel of all developments leading to a policy. \"If you don't carry them along, whatever policy \nyou adopt may end up somewhere else\" he said.\n\nHe said as a Ministry they have never received a report from the National Youth Council identifying lapses in any \narea and possible solutions.\n\n11.53\n\nMrs Okpuno also highlighted many government interventions that seek to generate employment in the country. She \nsaid Labour based technology remains the best way to \"utilize the idle hands we have in this country\".\n\nShe also commended the report for being an \"evidence based research\".\n\n11.41\n\nThe discussants\n\n11.38\n\nFirst to speak is Mrs Okpuno who said employment generation is a task that must be accomplished.\n\nShe also said the launch of the report provides an opportunity to look at the challenges of youth unemployment in \nNigeria.\n\nShe said over the years Nigeria's economy has been witnessing wide income disparity, with high unemployment in \na fast rising population. She said the transformation agenda focuses on special areas of development that include \nhuman resource development.\n\nShe said the government is seriously thinking about job creation and it cuts across all MDAs.\n\nShe said the NSRP's report has confirmed that youth unemployment remains the major challenge in Nigeria. She \nsaid the figures speak volumes hence the country is facing serious unrest.\n\nShe also said the report has shown why unemployment remains high despite government's effort and reiterated \nthat government is aware of the lack of coordination mentioned in the report.\n\n11.36\n\nBreak is over. A panel discussion on perspective on NSRP's report to be chaired by Akupo Adege who is \nrepresenting Peter Papka, the Director GIS-SURE-P follows.\n\nOthers on the panel are Mrs. Jessie Okpuno, Director Wages and Employment in the Federal Ministry of Labour, \nLuka Jonathan, Director Enterprise Development and Promotion, Federal Ministry of Youth Development, Engr. \nSaleh Alhassan Kubah, Secretary General, Nigerian Youth Council, Samson Itodo, Head of Research and \nAdvocay, YAIGA and Mrs. Attah, the SA to the president on Job creation.\n\n11.13\n\nThe event is on a tea break now. But here are the audience and speakers in pictures.\n\n10.53\n\nMrs Attah said one of the key functions of her office is to interface with job creation agencies and bodies, create job \nfairs and generate data on job creation.\n\n\n\nShe said most of the initiative in place today should be maintained by successive administrations because it is the \nbest way to solve the problem. She said she was in the Niger Delta recently and reconfirmed that there is a strong \ncorrelation between unemployment and violent conflicts.\n\nShe said she came to the programme late because she lost two person in yesterday's bomb blast in Abuja.\n\nshe urged politicians to stop politicizing employment generation initiatives and also called on the media to play a \npart in reducing unemployment.\n\nShe said the government is doing something \"but we can do better\".\n\nShe added that what is required is the solution to the problems, saying one of which is report such as the one \nlaunched today. She urged all present to study the report and implement same in their various capacities.\n\n10.52\n\nThe Special Assistant to the President on Job Creation Josephin Washima-Attah is now presenting her key note \naddress.\n\n10.51\n\nMs. Banfield also highlighted some of the outcome of the Cohort with youth during the research.\n\nshe said 39% agreed that the government publish information on selection process, 26% agreed that programmes \nhad contributed to reducing unemployment in the country, while a whopping 79% agreed that only youth closed to \npoliticians eventually get employed.\n\nMs. Banfield thereafter highlighted some of the recommendations which include Planning and coordination as a \nsector, result- based management, sector- wide standards (Transparency, conflict gender-sensitivity, youth \ninvolvement) and then Active citizenship; monitoring government programmes.\n\n10.48\n\nMs. Banfield also said the President had also inaugurated a presidential committee on job creation and appointed a \nSpecial Assistant on Job Creation as part of his Transformation Agenda.\n\nFindings from the report according to Ms. Banfield include; Varied Technical Quality, both in design and \nimplementation, quality control and result monitoring.\n\nLimited consultation with the youth: the youth felt excluded from policy design and implementation\n\nGender; she said there is limited efforts made in given consideration to women in youth employment programmes.\n\nConflict Sensitivity: most of the employment programmes are designed with rhetorical goals.\n\nPoliticization of youth employment programmes and initiatives, she said it it paradoxical that politicians design \nemployment programmes to reduce conflicts with one hand and then take it away with another through \npoliticization.\n\nProblem Institutional coordination and leadership.\n\nFinally she identified the problem of also looking at the Symptoms not causes of the problems.\n\n10.38\n\nMs. Banfied also said apart from unemployment, other factors such as patrimonial politics, poverty and inequality \nalso lead to violent conflicts.\n\n\n\nShe also highlighted some of the Youth employment schemes of government such as SURE-P, YESSO, NEDEP, \nUEDP, IYDI, JOB FAIR, NDE, NYSC, SMEDAN, NAPEP EDC's e.t.c.\n\nShe also identified the National Action Plan for Employment Creation, National Youth Policy and National Policy on \nMSME's, as well as the Agricultural Transformation Action Plan.\n\n10.37\n\nThe report is now being presented by Jessica Banfied an NSRP consultant.\n\nMs Banfied identified the methodology of the report which involved Literature review, State and Federal Level policy \nmapping and analysis, Youth Cohort Study; FGDs in 8 states; Civil Society and Peer Review Process.\n\n10.37\n\nILO representative, Denis Olu, speaking also said for peace to be maintained the dividends of peace are provided. \nHe also said it is not just about Jobs but the quality of jobs to be created. He also spoke about the sustainability of \nthe jobs created and an all inclusive growth.\n\nHe said unemployment should not be left to the markets alone. He said data is very important in finding solution to \nthe problems of unemployment in Nigeria.\"Not just about data but information and some of the information that ILO \nis looking for will be in the report\" he said.\n\nHe said a lot of programmes in Nigeria is always on the supply side with very little attention to demand.\n\n\"What sort of graduates are we getting into the market, we might be training people whose demand is not in the \nmarket\" he said.\n\nHe said greater attention should also be given to skills acquisition through entrepreneurial training. He said NSRP \nhas provided the resource needed by all involved and thanked the body for the report.\n\n10.31\n\nNDE, DG said the NDE considers the launch so important that all the Directors of the agency are present at the \nlaunching.\n\nHe said the NDE constantly carry out in house assessment to find out the impact it is having on employment \ngeneration.\n\nHe said relevant local and international bodies has commended the agency for this assessment efforts.\n\nHe said employment and empowerment, without a doubt, remains one of the most effective method of reducing \nviolent conflicts in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the NDE is fully committed to working with the NSRP in the implementation of the recommendations of the \nreport.\n\n10.29\n\nAlso attending launch is the Director General of National Directorate of Employment, Abubakar Mohammed.\n\nNSRP Programm Manager Dr. Ukoha Ukiwo speaking said NSRP seeks to work with Nigerian Institutions and \nactors to support them manage their capacity to manage violent conflicts.\n\nHe said everywhere they went in Nigeria, Youth Unemployment was identified as the key source of violence in \nNigeria. He added that that was why the research was undertaken.\n\n\n\nHe said the research looked at all the employment programmes of past governments. He said most of the \nprogrammes are conflict management institutions and they looked at how they are fairing and how diligent they had \nbeen in carrying out their assignments.\n\nHe said early findings confirmed that even though most of the programmes had significant budgets, there was a \nproblem of consultations with the youth who often felt alienated.\n\nHe said NSRP thought it necessary to now bequeath these programmes with requisite date to help aid their work.\n\nHe said NSRP will work with Civil Society and legislature to try to make impact in producing model employment \nprogramme that other employment programmes can use to implement their programmes.\n\nHe urged those present to partner with the NSRP to achieve that objective.\n\n10.26\n\nMr. Kenny also said the report being launched today is timely and hope the recommendations contained therein will \nbe taken forward.\n\n10.23\n\nDFID representative Simon Kenny also said when he saw the topic\"Winners or Loser\" he thought session will \ndiscuss Nigeria's match last night.\n\nHe said NSRP is one of the broad programmes DFID supports in Nigeria and it is about helping Nigeria use its \nresources to achieve its economic objectives.\n\nThe solution to create growth is simple to articulate but difficult to execute. The country relies too much on Oil and \nGas and that some of the problems facing Nigeria would be reduced through NSRP, he explained.\n\n10.21\n\nThe launch is chaired by Kole Shettima, a member of the board of NSRP.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Mr. Shettima said what will be discussed is very important for Nigeria because of the \nprevailing circumstances. He said recent Data shows that Youth between 0-24 constitute 63% of population, which \ncan be positive or negative depending on number of choices made by Nigerians.\n\nHe said it can be Positives if right investments are made and negative if wrong investments are made.\n\n10.17\n\nNSRP project manager, Ukoha Ukiwo, delivering the opening remarks. caption id=\"attachment_163833\" \nalign=\"aligncenter\" width=\"465\"] Nsrp project manager, Ukoha Ukiwo[/caption]\n\n19.22\n\nThis live update is now closed.

Credit to him.\n\n00.27\n\nIf the game ends as it stands and Nigeria can manage a draw against Argentina, then the Eagles will qualify for the \nknockout round.\n\n00.23\n\nConcentration is key for the Eagles as we go into the last 25 minutes of the game. Nigeria still leading with that lone \ngoal by Osaze.\n\n00.21\n\n\n\nShola Ameobi replaces Ahmed Musa.\n\n00.21\n\nBosnia have made their third and final substitution.\n\n00.19\n\nThe Nigerian supporters are surely providing the Eagles with that needed 12th man.\n\n00.18\n\nEmenike and Babatunde try Begovic from close range in quick succession, but the Bosnian keeper is forced into \nmaking decent saves.\n\n00.16\n\nIbisevic, the man who scored Bosnia's goal against Argentina, has been brought on. Salihovic also comes on for \nLulic.\n\n00.15\n\nSecond change for Bosnia.\n\n00.14\n\nIf only Onazi can learn to be more of a team player. He sure has the potentials.\n\n00.13\n\nBosnia make their first change, bringing on another striker.\n\n00.11\n\nBegovic is forced to make a save, as the Eagles press for the second goal.\n\n00.09\n\nVictor Moses' deputy Babatunde, is making good use of the starting chance given him.\n\n00.08\n\nOsaze is the first Stoke City player to score in a #WorldCup , commentator says.\n\n00.07\n\nBosnia's attacks have mainly come from Nigeria's left full back.

More purpose than against Iran.\n\n23.48\n\nHalf time, and Nigeria leads 1-0. How would you rate the Eagles performance in this first half?\n\n23.46\n\nMikel has lost the ball at least twice while holding on to it for too long.\n\n23.45\n\nEmenike's strength and pace appears to much for the Bosnian defense to handle.\n\n23.43\n\nNigeria's defense needs to pay more attention to Dzeko. He's been let go too often.\n\n23.33\n\nSo far, its been a formidable World Cup match. Its been attack and counter attack from both teams, with Bosnia \ntaking more time in their build-up.\n\n23.30\n\nGOAL!! Its Nigeria 1 Bosnia 0. Osaze opens the scoring.\n\n23.29\n\nVincent Enyeama has been kept busy for the past 5minutes, and that's as a result of Nigeria losing the ball in \nmidfield.\n\n23.25\n\nBosnia seem to be getting back into the match. Their passes are connecting better.\n\n\n\n23.24\n\nEnyeama makes a good save to deny the Bosnian winger.\n\n23.17\n\nEmenike takes a wayward shot that almost leads to a counter for Bosnia.\n\n23.16\n\nThe Bosnia keeper has may feel the wrath of the eagles shooting today.\n\n23.14\n\nOsaze has a shot stopped by the goalkeeper, but the supplier Babatunde was offside.\n\n23.13\n\nIt does seem the Eagles are more fired for this game. Closing down better than they did against Iran, to win back \nthe ball.\n\n23.10\n\nThe game begins at a frantic pace. both teams going all out.\n\n21.18\n\nA commissioner, in the Fayemi cabinet, who doesn't wants to be named just told some of his supporters that almost \nall senior member of the Fayemi government, including the governor and his deputy lost in their wards.\n\n20.54\n\nArmed with a sheet of paper, torch lights and guns in a dark street, police officers created a roadblock about 500 \nmetres from the collation centre where journalists and others whose names are not in their sheet are turned back. \nThe intervention of Taiwo Gbadegeshin, INEC PRO coyld not salvage the situation as he too was sent back to his \noffice by the police officers.

Beautiful strike shot narrowly wide.\n\n21.40\n\nLess than 10 minutes to go. The Nigerian midfield has collapsed and ball control dropped drastically. Iran now \nmaking a strong push for a goal, even though they lack quality strikers to slot in a goal.\n\n21.30\n\nGreat cross from Oshaniwa on the left flank and a header narrowly missed by Ameobi. It is his first World Cup \nappearance.\n\n21.28\n\nThe match has been boring so far. Both sides had fair chances but have been unable to convert. Incomplete \npasses have continued. Osaze in to replace Azeez.\n\n21.16\n\n57 minutes played, still no goal. Nigeria is however waking into the game in this half, but finishing has been poor so \nfar.\n\n21.10\n\nIt is Iran who is mounting the pressure in this half. Victor Moses is off for Shola Ameobi.\n\n21.05\n\nSecond half begins.\n\n20.57\n\nWhat is your analysis of Nigeria's performance in the first half?

Iranian national anthem is taken first.\n\n19.42\n\nThe Nigerian side is warming up at the moment. Mikel is expected to hold the team together, and push forward.

Victor Moses and Emenike are the \nhopeful goal scorers.\n\n19.37\n\nIn the build up to the world cup, Nigeria played three friendlies, drew two and lost the last one to United States. \nMany Nigerians are hopeful the Super Eagles will turning a winning leaf today, with an expected trashing of Iran. \nMost Nigerians predict Nigeria will win Iran.\n\n19.28\n\n\n\nIran will come out in white with black inscriptions while Nigeria will be dressed in our traditional green apparel - \nOnly that this time, Nigeria's will wear a green very close to that of the local telecom giant, Glo.\n\n19.24\n\nNigerian players are already making their way into the Stadium, lead by Stephen Keshi.

Fashola said that for sports, a lot of \njob could be created, that is true. There are so many ways to create employment. There are so many ways to \nencourage the creation of employment.\n\n\"After 26 years in Ghana, when I came back to Nigeria, what I noticed was that even our mechanics are not well \ntrained. A driver in Ghana, before he gets to driving, must be made to go for an auto-mechanic training.\n\n\"That's the way for Nigeria to go.\"\n\nThe announcer says it is time for Governor Amaechi to present the communique.\n\n16.11\n\nResponding to a comment from a speaker that government should invest more in agriculture in Ogoni land where \nthey have a large arable land; Amaechi says that to get land for farming in Ogoni is like fighting a war.\n\n\"We have over 300 cases in court on over 2,000 hectares of land. The banana farm...99 percent of those in the \nbanana farm are from Ogoni.\"\n\nFashola, in what he called his \"intervention,\" notes that today's employment has moved beyond the usual 9 to 5 \njob.\n\n\"Last year, we employed 92,000 people from road construction alone.\n\n\"How sustainable is the world that continues to desire to bring more people in the world saying we don't employ \neverybody. We must slow down growth.\n\n\"The new war that will be fought is on the creation of local employment.\"\n\n15.43\n\n\n\nOnly three State governors are left at the retreat - Amaechi, the host; Oshiomhole of Edo; and Fashola of Lagos.\n\nThe third session, focusing on youth unemployment, has gone into a question and answer segment.\n\nSunmonu, the session Chairman, asks if anyone is seeing job opportunities in the 60 million unemployed youths in \nNigeria.\n\n15.32\n\nOshiomhole says the private sector needs to drive employment.\n\n\"Two things drive the private sector: money and infrastructure.\n\n\"Governments, including the Edo State government, will never be able to employ everyone. Even if I devote all the \nresources of Edo State to create jobs.\n\nOshiomhole blames high level of unemployment on faulty monetary policy and lack of electricity.\n\n\"It is like telling someone to live long and then giving him poison.\n\n\"How can you create jobs by pricing money out of the reach of investors in the name of achieving market stability.\n\n\"There is a limit to what we can do as governors without power.\"\n\nOshiomhole further says that companies like Michelin, Bata, textile firms in Aba had closed down because of lack \nof power.\n\n\"In Bangladesh, a small country, 60 percent of their total earnings come from textile industries, creating millions of \njobs.\n\n\"This is not what we see in pentecostal business where, with the power of the Holy Spirit, everything becomes \npossible.\n\n\"I believe Nigeria has all the potentials. But without power, without sensible industrial policy, without tackling \ncorruption, we will continue to wallow in symptoms of Boko Haram.\"\n\n15.17\n\nFola Adeola urges governors to make internet broadband readily available to citizens.\n\n\"We need to create sources of employment as much as possible. The cell phone is where the wealth of the future \nresides.\"\n\nLike Adeola, Wamakko says he never applied for a job after his graduation - the jobs were waiting for him.\n\nSunmonu says the governors have begun doing disappearing acts after Wamakko takes his leave immediately \nafter his presentation.\n\n\"I think next time the organizers should make unemployment the first session,\" he adds.\n\nOshiomhole begins by noting that he was downgraded from Labour boss to a state governor.\n\n\"I used to be president,\" he says.\n\nHe further says he told Obasanjo during a dinner in 2003 to focus on a three point agenda. \"Number 1 is \nunemployment. Number 2 is unemployment. Number 3 is unemployment.\"\n\n15.03\n\n\n\nThe retreat has reconvened for the third and last session.\n\nThe session 'Overview of the state of Unemployment in Nigeria' will be chaired Hassan Sunmonu, former Secretary \nGeneral, Organization of African Trade Union.\n\nPresenters/discussants include Professor Olu Ajakaiye, President, Nigeria Economic Society; Fola Adeola, \nFounder, FATE Foundation; Rauf Aregbesola, Governor, Osun State; Murtala Nyako, Governor, Adamawa State; \nand Adams Oshiomhole, Governor, Edo State.\n\nMr. Aregbesola did not attend the retreat.\n\n13.54\n\nThe hall is now empty.\n\nGovernors and guests have gone for prayers and lunch.\n\nThe next session, the third, will be the last one before a communique is drawn up.\n\n13.53\n\nOnly seven Governors are remaining in the hall as Senator Saraki winds up the second session.\n\nThe announcer starts to announce a short break for Jumat prayers and lunch but changes his mind mid-way.\n\n\"I've just been told that the next session will begin immediately. Those going for the Jumat prayers will join us when \nthey return,\" he says.\n\nThe hall is virtually empty.\n\n13.33\n\nGovernor Fashola says the community also has a role to play in attaining a robust healthcare system.\n\n\"For me, it is how to prevent people from being ill that is the most important aspect.\"\n\n\"The primary healthcare system will help but I think what will help more is the environment, provision of water, \nprevention of open defaecation and so on.\n\nFashola also says that people must start having the number of children they can take care of.\n\nGovernor Amaechi says governors must transcend mere construction of structures to building a system that is \nrunning. He adds that Rivers State has 140 primary health centres and the rural centres have 10 patients per day.\n\nThe session has gone into a question and answer segment.\n\n13.31\n\nGovernor Amosun details how his government has achieved zero maternal mortality.\n\nHe says primary healthcare is the most important sector in Ogun State.\n\n\"We have two programmes: the Conditional Grant Scheme which makes sure that during pregnancy, all pregnant \nwomen are entitled to N1,000 during each of the six ante-natal visits. During childbirth, they receive N3,000 plus \nbaby care products. After birth, they receive N1,000 in each four post natal visit.\n\n\"We also buy mobile phones for them. In all we budget N25,000 per pregnant woman.\"\n\nAmosun also says that NHIS cannot solve Nigeria's health problem.\n\n\n\n13.31\n\nSaraki argues that the NHIS takes care of only the formal sector and advocates for more funding to the primary \nhealthcare sector.\n\n\"If we can invest more money in primary healthcare, the money we will have invested in the secondary and tertiary \nhealthcare will have reduced.\"\n\nProf. Owolabi says that more investment needs to be made in the health sector.\n\n\"In 1964, the University College Hospital, Ibadan, was recognized as the 4th best institution in the whole of \nCommonwealth.\"\n\n13.05\n\nThe first session has ended. The second session 'Overview of the Current State of the Health Sector at the Sub-\nNational Level' and 'Achieving and Sustaining Universal Primary Healthcare at the Subnational Level' begins \nimmediately. The session is chaired by Senator Bukola Saraki and presenters/discussants include Governors \nAmaechi, Fashola, and Amosun. As well as Professors Oyewole Owolabi, Professor Emeritus, Formerly of Ford \nFoundation; and Prof. Oyewale Tomori, Former Vice Chancellor, Redeemers University\n\n13.01\n\nLife After Office\n\nOrji Uzor Kalu says that as a governor for 8 years, his businesses all over the world suffered.\n\nHe also enjoined leaders to think towards entrepreneurship and providing employment opportunities to people in \ncompanies where they have dominant shares.\n\n\"Also mind the type of people you want to succeed you. You all know my story. Beware of animals in human skin.\"\n\nGovernor Oshiomhole says he wondered why a governor is so important to \"merit this level of conversation.\"\n\n\"Governor is an office and like every office there is a time to go.\"\n\nHe says that his only fear after leaving office is being able to move around freely.\n\nGovernor Nyako says he has prepared for life as a farmer and doesn't expect any benefits from the government \nwhen he leaves office.\n\n\"I don't intend to trouble myself with what benefits I will get after office. If they don't give me anything, I will not \ntrouble myself.\"\n\n12.58\n\nIn his reaction, Okorocha says he doesn't think about life after office.\n\n\"But I know it must come. For every sunrise there must be a sunset. I don't think it's something we must belabour \nourselves.\"\n\nOkorocha says that it is the fear of life after office that pushes some people to engage in \"primitive accumulation of \nwealth.\"\n\n\"Who you are before office is also very important. If we elect a criminal into office, he will simply become excellency \ncriminal. When you serve the people well, the people will become your security.\n\n\"People often think that dramatization of poverty is humility. For me, the dramatization of poverty is stupidity.\n\n\n\n\"And poverty, by the way, is strategic. Be careful.\n\n\"I've gone through it and I swore that my generation will never experience it. It is better to have AIDS than poverty.\n\n\"A president must not dramatize poverty. A president must have charisma... Let me stop here.\"\n\n12.56\n\nAjimobi says that people govern better when they are prepared for it.\n\n\"It is not enough for a leader to visualize. You must have the courage to implement.\n\n\"The first person the king attacks is the kingmaker. Avoid always trying to influence or control your successor.\n\n\"When I leave office, I want to be a preacher. I want to be a consultant. I want to be able to tell people that there is \nGod.\n\n\"My final word is avoid enjoying what you usually cannot afford and just know that life is transient.\"\n\n12.55\n\nAjimobi is first to react to Prof. Jinadu's presentation. He says he's already experienced what life after office was \nlike.\n\n\"I have worked in the oil industry for about 30 years. I've ran businesses that are very profitable. I had all my \nchildren when I was working in the oil industry. When I'm in a lucrative position, all manner of people bring gifts. But \nthe moment you leave that lucrative position, they will not even greet you.\"\n\nAjimobi gave an example of when he became an MD and a chief engineer brought some documents for him to sign.\n\n\"Always review a document before you sign.\n\n\"When you go to commission the project and you are not satisfied. He would whisper in your ear - Oga, it's part of \nthat thing that you signed.\"\n\n12.10\n\nA member of the panel, Professor Adele Jinadu, said that the problems leaders face after exiting government is an \nuncharted territory in academic circles.\n\nProf. Jinadu said that based on interactions with governors, after office they still face \"serious\" economic, \npsychological, political, social, and other challenges. He attributed the challenges partly to the country's political \nclimate in which political power is used to acquire economic power.\n\nUnder psychological/personal challenges, Prof. Jinadu outlines issues such as the temptation of viewing office as \nbeing a job and not a vocation, reconciling the role of the governor as the servant of the people, upholding the \ndignity of the office of the governor, enjoying the ideals of the perks of office without abusing them, and avoiding \nsnares by opponents.\n\nIn his guide book to the governors, Prof. Jinadu also called for the separation of the office of the governor from the \nperson and also a balancing of office with family life.\n\n10.59\n\nProf. Sawyer says that preparation for life after office begins at the time of swearing in.\n\n\"When appointed or elected, it is important to see public service as a privilege.\n\n\n\nHe says that public service is an assignment and not an entitlement, and as an assignment, it is time bound.\n\n\"We must be mindful that others are to follow us. And most often, we will have had a predecessor. We have a \nresponsibility to build on the good things of our predecessor...\n\n\"There is a tendency to condemn our predecessor. It does not enhance development and brings an adversarial \nrelationship between incumbent and predecessor.\"\n\n10.52\n\nThe first session 'Transitioning Out - Life after Office: Perspective and Challenges' is chaired by Professor Sawyer.\n\nPresenters and panellists include Ajimobi, Okorocha, Adele Jinadu, and Managing Director of Daily Telegraph who \nrepresented Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nProf. Sawyer thanked the governors for giving him an opportunity to share his experiences with them.\n\n\"Africans owe an enormous debt to Mbeki, former South African president, for his extraordinary leadership in \npromotion of good governance. Since his retirement, he has been just as busy.\n\n\"We also owe gratitude to Obasanjo and Mbeki who in 2003 brought the leadership of my country to an end by \npersuading Taylor to step down and leave.\n\nProf. Sawyer also said that the quality of life after office is shaped by the quality of service while in office.\n\n10.41\n\nThe 4th Nigeria Governors' Forum retreat began with a rendition of the National Anthem.\n\nFayemi of Ekiti State said the opening prayers.\n\nAmaechi began his welcome remarks by requesting a minute silence for the late Emir of Kano, and Nyako said a \nshort prayer for the repose of his soul.\n\nAmaechi said that today's retreat is held at a critical juncture in our national life. \"It is imperative that we do some \nstock takings as we prepare to bow out in 2015,\" said Amaechi.\n\nThe announcer asked everyone apart from the member of the Forum and resource persons to leave the hall. But \nAmaechi intervened and asked everyone to stay.\n\n\"Let us reflect on the crack on the body of the Nigeria Governors Forum. The time to bring everybody back is now,\" \nhe added.\n\n10.21\n\nThe state governors seated in for the retreat include those of Rivers, Lagos, Kwara, Ekiti, Adamawa, Sokoto , \nKano, Ogun, and Imo states.\n\nSenator Bukola Saraki arrived a while ago.\n\n10.20\n\nFormer Liberian President, Emos Sawyer and Fola Adeola are resource persons for the retreat.\n\n09.55\n\nThe three northern governors in the venue stood up to have a few minutes chat with one another behind the three \nother governors before rejoining their colleagues. The governors' security officers have been asked to move to a \n\n\n\nhall behind the venue. Invited guests have taken up all the available seats in the hall. The programme will start \nshortly, according to the announcer.\n\n09.54\n\n09.49\n\nMore governors have arrived. Murtala Nyako of Adamawa; Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo; and Aliyu Wamakko of Sokoto \nState. It's been an APC affair so far.\n\n09.35\n\nThe retreat is yet to officially commence. But the Governors have started arriving. Rabiu Kwankwaso of Kano State \nand Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State are the first to arrive. Mr. Fayemi went round to hug and exchange banters with \nsome of the guests before taking his seat while Mr. Kwankwaso marched straight to his chair. 22 seats have been \nset up for the Governors. The reason for that is not yet clear.\n\n08.59\n\nThree state governors have been sighted around the venue, including Rotimi Amaechi, the host Governor. The \nothers are Rabiu Kwankwaso, the Kano State Governor, and Rochas Okorocha, Imo State Governor. Unlike the \nprevious retreat in Lagos which turned out to be an APC Governors affair, today's retreat is expected to feature \nsome PDP Governors in key roles. Jonah Jang, the Plateau State Governor and Chairman of a faction of the \nGovernors' Forum is expected to be a discussant in one of the sessions. Sessions will also feature other PDP \nGovernors as presenters and discussants. The PDP Governors were also scheduled to take part in discussions at \nthe Lagos retreat but they failed to turn up.\n\n18.10\n\nThank you for following our live blog.\n\n18.09\n\nThe Symposium ends. The campaigners said they will return to street protests.\n\n17.58\n\nTwo little girls and a boy were on stage asking for the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls to be brought back alive and \nnow!\n\n17.57\n\nAn eight years old boy also spoke on how he wants the girls back and at the end of his short speech shouted \"What \nare we demanding for\" and the crowd replied, \"the truth and nothing but the truth.\"\n\n17.56\n\nJibrin Ibrahim, the moderator, has just posed a question to the panelists saying: \"If you were my students, how \nwould you demand the release of the abducted girls?\" Maureen Kabrik, a panelist answered first. She concluded \nher speech with a saying by Madiba: \"Never deny people their human rights and their humanity.\" She shouted \n\"Your loyalty is to who\" and the attendees shouted \"the Chibok girls\" and she shouts again saying \"What are we \ndemanding\" and everyone replies \"Bring Back Our Girls Now and Alive!!\" Listen to her full speech in the playlist \nabove.\n\n17.35\n\n\n\nDr Omano: \"We are not Igbo or Hausa, we are not Muslims, it just simply means we are human beings\" \"Citizens \nare drivers and custodians of democracy, that is why you are claiming that the government has to be responsive to \ncitizens\" \"We are only saying the government we elected should exercise thier functions and bring back our girls \nnow and alive\" \"Sending thugs to intimidate us is a mistake, they are not going to send thugs to the international \npeople protesting.\" He said his advise to the troublemakers is \"Join this movement to bring back our girls now and \nalive.\"\n\n17.26\n\nThe panalists.

Be \nassured you will be the first to hear what they said.\n\n17.08\n\nProfessor Awwal Yadudu spoke after Oby Ezekwesili saying he had a flight to catch but forfeited it to attend.\n\n\"We have one focus and only one focus to bring our girls back and alive,\" he explained.\n\n\"We should look at ourselves as believers and not one faith fighting another faith. We would keep our sights on the \nneed to remain united and I don't see need for anyone finding the need to undermine us,\" the professor said.\n\nListen to his speech in the playlist above.\n\n16.56\n\nOby Ezekwesili has been reading events relating to efforts to rescue the schoolgirls since the news of the kidnap \nwas first broken. She explained the happenings \"Last Monday, May 26th, a new group called Boko Haram Release \nOur Girls also joined the campaign and we began to observe hostility during the meetings. It became worse the \nnext day with the way they would sing their Islamic songs and Christian songs to disrupt our meeting but we \ndecided to remain civilized citizens\"\n\n16.35\n\nOn May 8, The NSA, the IG Police and service Chiefs visited Chibok. This basically happened 24 days after the \nkidnap of the Chibok girls.

Two weeks after the abduction of the Chibok \ngirls, the parents asked \"why has the government not done anything about this?\"\n\n16.13\n\nThe symposium commenced with the second stanza of the National Anthem as opening prayer. The theme of the \ndemocracy day event is \"Citizens, Accountability and Democracy\". The purpose of the event is to gather as a family \nto discuss strategies on how to reach out to the government to bring the kidnapped girls back to their parents. Oby \nEzekwesili addressed the attendees on the chronology of events since the Chibok girls were kidnapped.

And the answers we have received is inadequate,\" Oby \nEzekwesili said. \"Please let Mr. President know that the answers we received is not enough. Tell him also that he \nalso missed a colossal opportunity to address his citizens on a crucial issue. \"Our proposal is: that we will demand \nof Mr. President another opportunity of addressing the issues that the citizens have put before him as the \ncommander-in -chief. \"We also want the delegates to tell the president that we hold the office of the president in \nvery high esteem,\" she said.\n\n17.46\n\nThe protest ends in Eagle Square, two kilometres away from the intended Aso Rock destination. Protesters \ndisperse, others return to Unity Fountain singing solidarity songs.\n\n17.22\n\nThe questions protesters want government officials to answer include: Why has the president not visited Chibok? \nWhere were the security operatives when Chibok was attacked for four hours even though there was a state of \nemergency and many more?\n\n17.17\n\n\n\nProtesters are still at the Eagles Square, about two kilometres away from Aso Rock. They read their demands, in \nturns, to the government representatives that met them. It appears the protest will terminate at this point, but the \norganizers are not saying anything yet.\n\n17.00\n\nThe Police Commissioner in Abuja, Joseph Mbu, who had earlier threatened to stop the protest has been very \ncooperative with the protesters. In Eagle Square, he told protesters sitting on the floor that he was supporting them, \nthough in uniform. Mr. Mbu also ordered his orderly to get cold water for the women.\n\n16.29\n\nAt the Eagle Square, close to the presidential villa entrance, the protesters are met by a team of government \nofficials including the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Bala Mohammed, Secretary to the Government of the \nFederation, Pius Anyim, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Reuben Abati, and others. The \nprotesters' initial destination - the presidential villa - is still about two kilometres away.\n\n16.24\n\nThis is how the protesters will introduce themselves when they eventually get to Aso Rock. Who are we? Crowd: \nChibok family What are we demanding? Crowd : #BringBackOurGirls Now and Alive\n\n16.22\n\nPolice officers barricade the road leading into Aso Rock, as expected.

The march is halted as Oby Ezekwesili \naddresses the crowd on purpose and discipline.\n\n15.47\n\nThe protest takes its first step away from the Unity Fountain starting point. Protesters are still in lines but organizers \nare working hard to keep it that way.\n\n15.44\n\n\"We are going to be a model of a discipline, nobody will talk to the president rudely. Our questions are simple and \nstraight.

Make sure you have a touch of red, if you do not have one a red T-shirt will be \ngiven to you soon. 3. Look at your neighbours and report any suspicious person or item. 5. Do not carry any thing \nthat will inconvenience you. 6. Do not carry any kind of metal that can be seen as a weapon.\n\n15.21\n\nThere are close to one thousand people gather at the Unity Fountain starting point of the protest.

It is now closed.\n\n\n\n16.31\n\nNaomi Mutah Nyadar leader of the #BringBackOurGirls Abuja protest has been released.\n\n15.09\n\nIt has been more than three hours since Naomi Mutah Nyadar, leader of the #BringBackOurGirls Abuja protest was \nwhisked away in Presidency van to an unknown location. Her lawyers say they are still unable to establish contacts \nwith her. Even in her absence, the #BringBackOurGirls protest plans to go ahead at the Unity Fountain in Abuja, \nmeteres away from the venue of the planned World Economic Forum.\n\n13.04\n\nLawyers of the detained #BringBackOurGirls protest leader say they are yet to establish contacts with her since she \nwas whisked away in a car belonging to the Presidency from the Asokoro Police station. Meanwhile, the crowd that \ngathered at the Asokoro police station have now dispersed.\n\n11.58\n\nMrs. Nyadar has been moved away from the Asokoro police station where a crowd was swelling and demanding \nher release. She was whisked from the station in van belonging to the presidency. It is believed she would be \nreturned to the presidential villa in a secluded area of town and out of reach by protesters. The presidency is not \nknow to have any legal detention center.\n\n11.37\n\nThe Associated Press is reporting that Nigeria's First Lady, Patience Jonathan ordered the arrest of Naomi Mutah \nNyadar. Another leader of the protest, Saratu Angus Ndirpaya, told AP State Security Service agents drove her and \nMrs Nyadar to the police station after an all-night meeting with the First lady at the presidential villa in Abuja. She \nsaid police immediately released her but held Mrs. Nyadar. She told AP the First Lady expressed doubts there was \nany kidnapping and accused them of belonging to Boko Haram. Mrs. Ndirpaya said the First Lady accused them of \nfabricating the abductions. \"She told so many lies, that we just wanted the government of Nigeria to have a bad \nname, that we did not want to support her husband's rule,\" she said in a telephone interview with AP. See full AP \nreport here.\n\n11.12\n\nEfforts by lawyers to free the detained leader of the #BringBackOurGirls protest have been stalled as the Divisional \nPolice Officer in charge of the Asokoro police station where she is detained has \"absconded.\" The police officer \nwho is said to have exclusive knowledge of her offence locked her up and left the station after crowd began to \ngather to demand her release. According Mrs. Nyarda's lawyers, she is detained arbitrarily without an offence as \nthe police has no documentation about her in the station. \"Her name is not listed in he 'entry book' at the station \nand no one else besides the DPO knows about her case,\" her lawyers said.\n\n20.46\n\nThe seventh presidential media chat ends. \"The issue of security, we are handling it...\" the said as his parting \nwords. \"Let the parents [of missing Chibok schoolgirls] come forward and help us, and I promise we shall find the \ngirls.]\n\n20.42\n\nThe chat progresses into the legitimacy of the ongoing National Conference. The president said the conference is \nlegitimate. The key thing is how to work with the parliament to make the best use of what is output from the \nconference.\n\n\n\n20.42\n\nIf you go on strike for one day, you are supposed to forgo your salary, the president said on ASUP Strike\n\n20.40\n\nTweet from Emmanuel Sunday requested for the introduction of other core subjects in schools and the offering of \nfree textbooks. The president said an agencies are in place to handle the request for free textbooks.\n\n20.32\n\nOlarenwaju Smart tweeted a question about the president's earlier claim that Boko Haram had infiltrated his \ncabinet. \"I never said that Boko Haram has infiltrated my cabinet,\" the president replied. \"I used the word \ngovernment.\" The president said some security agents in his government are currently under investigation for \ninvolvement in Boko Haram.\n\n20.28\n\nThe president again evades to state categorically if he intends to stand for election or not.\n\n20.27\n\n\"The issue of declaration should not be a problem for Nigerian,\" the president said, while pressed for his ambitions. \nHe said Nigerians should be more concerned with what the panel had discussed with him earlier.\n\n20.25\n\nThe president admits the power reforms are not moving as fast as expected but says the country will never go back \nto the days when it was producing just 2000 MW of electricity. He said the first problem he had was gas [for \ngeneration] and then distribution.\n\n20.22\n\nSome papers and magazine are specifically set up by to oppose government. He said a paper called NEXT was \nset up from the onset to to bring the government down and its target was the Ministry of Petroleum Ministry and \nwhen they didn't succeed, it died. He spoke when defending alleged corruption in the Petroleum ministry. He also \ndefended the petroleum minister's alleged extravagance on private jets.\n\n20.17\n\nThe president said he will not hesitate to increase pump price if he has to do it. But for now, he has no plans to \nincrease pump price.\n\n20.13\n\n\"I cannot increase pump price through the back door. if I want to do it, I will do it,\" the president said in reaction to \nquestions regarding recent petrol scarcity in Nigeria and rumored plans to increase pump price in Nigeria. HE said \nif anyone manipulates sales points, it is criminal.\n\n20.09\n\nThe president, while reacting to that corruption question, spent a lot of time showing his dissatisfaction with the \ninconsistencies in CBN governor's allegations. \"Sanusi is not an ordinary Nigerian,\" he said.\n\n20.07\n\nThe president's argument is that it is impossible to steal billion in Nigeria. \"If anybody steals billion, I am telling you, \nwe will know... billion now in this country, we will celebrate it,\" the president said.\n\n\n\n20.04\n\nThe issue of the Missing billion is up again as the president tackles a question on corruption by Bashiru Saad \nAbdulahi of the BBC World Service.\n\n19.59\n\nHe said Nigeria must spend money to organize the World Economic Forum but justifies it saying it is necessary to \ncreate jobs. \"For you to create jobs, you must encourage the private sector,\" he said.\n\n19.56\n\nThe president defended creation of 1.6 million jobs in 2013 He mentioned Agric, Nollywood, Sure-P, YouWin as \nareas were jobs were created, but did not give specifics. He insists that National Bureau of Statistics has details of \nthe 1.6 mn jobs, \"I have asked them to publish it,\" he said. He admits government cannot employ more than 5% of \nNigerians but said he has created environment for small and medium scale enterprise to thrive.\n\n19.53\n\nUnemployment and Jobs People must know that re-basing the economy has not added anything to 'us', the \npresident said while discussing job creation in his administration. \"Re-basing the economy does not mean new \nthings were created, it simply means proper stock taking of the economy,\" he said. Government cannot employ \nmore than 5%, he said, arguing that government creates good environment for employers to thrive.\n\n19.46\n\nHE adds that Nigeria is discussing with U.S., France, Uk and China to help Nigeria tackle the terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n19.45\n\nThe president said he has had personal discussions with Barrack Obama of the U.S where he requested for \nassistance to tackle Boko Haram.\n\n19.41\n\nThe issues have rolled to planned World Economic Forum. The president explains that his decision to shut down \nthe entire city for the project is with good intention. He said it is to make movement of the attendees easier and \nfaster. He appeals to the private institutions to join government offices and shutdown during the WEF. \"Nigeria will \nnot be the first country, people in other countries do that,\" he said. \"It does not affect our economy.\" \"We are not \nsaying that private companies must close down, but we advise that they do,\" he added.\n\n19.35\n\nWithout the state of emergency, security operatives in affected states may be frustrated, he explains.\n\n19.33\n\n\"Terrorism is not a phenomenon a six months or one year State of Emergency can solve,\" the President said while \njustifying the performance of the state of emergency in place in the most affected northeast Nigeria states. His \nexplanation indicates a plan to extend the state of emergency in the affected states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.\n\n19.28\n\n\"Were are receiving an unfair share of the global terror,\" the president said while trying to blame external [foreign] \nforces targeting the destruction of Africa's largest economy [Nigeria]. He argues that because of Nigeria's size and \neconomy, many world forces are interested in its downfall.\n\n\n\n19.22\n\nwhile reviewing the capability of Nigeria's security agents to respond to the increasing security challenges in \nNigeria, the president said they were \"capable\". He added that he had reached a decision to recruit more and train \nthem well.\n\n19.19\n\nWhile comparing the security situation in Nigeria's northeast with what happened in the Niger Delta few years back, \nthe president said they situations were different. He argues the difference is in Boko Haram's clandestine \noperations and lack of distinct or public leadership. \"The Niger Delta militants were not terrorist. I'm not trying to \ndefend them,\" he said.\n\n19.15\n\n530 were registered in that school, according to WAEC. 193 were relocated to other schools. The school, \nalthough a girls' only collage was recently made a mixed school due to the security situation, explaining the reason \nthe number of students in the school at the time of the kidnap was high.\n\n19.11\n\nWhen asked if he was negotiating with the terrorists for the release of the girls, he said: \"You cant't negotiate with \npeople you don't know,\" pointing that it is not clear who has the girls. \"Some times, you people know more than \nme,\" he said.\n\n19.09\n\nThe president said he met with the Chibok school's principal and was informed 53 students have returned. But the \npolice insists only 44 have returned. He pleads with the parents and guardians o cooperate with security agencies \nto release information about the girls. He wants the guardians should give the police names and pictures of \nschoolgirls that are still missing.\n\n19.05\n\nThe issue of the kidnapped Chibok school girls is next on the table. The president said the security agencies have \nbeen combing everywhere since the girls were kidnapped. \"Wherever they are, we will surely get them back,\" he \nsaid.\n\n19.03\n\nFunke Fadugba - Ray Power, Bashiru Saad Abdulahi, BBC World Service, and Jide Ajani make up the panel.

He should go home.\" An issue up for consideration: We have literally myriads of \"has \nbeens\" at the national conference: Former governors, former lawmakers, former this, former that; Can't they \nsacrifice and do without the N12 million paid to them delegates?\n\n16.40\n\n#naijaHaardTaalk real faces of applicants at the NIS recruitment #NISstampede @PremiumTimesng @OSIWA1 \n@chairmanNHRC pic.twitter.com/LamAaxvbyi\n\n- Mikang Longjan (@mikoqp) March 21, 2014\n\n16.35\n\nJibrin Ibrahim: Inspite of all the problems I have with the National Conference, I fully support it.

Nigeria 3-1 South Africa\n\n19.37\n\nA second yellow card for South African Vuyo Mere. The match is now down to 10 against 10.\n\n19.34\n\nNigerian defender, Solomon Kwambe given a red card after a rough tackle on a South African player. Nigerian now \nplaying 10 against 11.\n\n19.32\n\nWhat would have been the best goal of this tournament, a fabulous strike by Chrisantus Uzoenyi, was held back \nfrom the net by the top bar. A semi-bicycle kick.\n\n19.26\n\nAgbim, the Nigerian goalkeeper has been brilliant today. He has made two spectacular saves to keep Nigeria \nahead with its 3-0 lead in the last 10 minutes.\n\n19.23\n\nGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL! Nigeria 3-0 South Africa. Another brilliant strike from Chrisantus Uzoenyi.\n\n19.10\n\nSecond half begins. Nigerian goalkeeper yellow carded for time wasting. Meanwhile in the other match. Mali has \nequalizer and are now the favorites to to qualify in second place, behind Nigeria.\n\n18.50\n\n\n\nFirst half ends. Nigeria 2-0 South Africa Mali 0-1 Mozambique If the match ends this way, Nigeria and South Africa \nwill move on to the quarter finals.\n\n18.48\n\nSouth Africa loses yet another close chance to get one back after a strike that lobbed the Nigerian goalkeeper went \nnarrowly wide.\n\n18.45\n\nIf the matches end as it stand, South Africa and Nigeria will go through to the next round, with Nigeria leading the \ngroup. Three minutes added to the first half.\n\n18.42\n\nSecond yellow card of the match goes to South African defender, Vuyo Mere.\n\n18.41\n\nIn the other match, Mozambique is leading Mali 1-0.\n\n18.37\n\nA South African free kick near the 18 yard box is shot straight into the Nigerian wall. Play continues.\n\n18.35\n\nSouth Africa almost got one back after a header from Parker missed the goal mark by inches. Meanwhile, South \nAfrica has made its first change. Mashego is in.\n\n18.33\n\nEde's goal was almost saved by the South African goalkeeper who got a hand to the shot. But the resulting \ndeflection was not enough to push the ball away from the net.\n\n18.32\n\nGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!! Ede scores the penalty. Nigeria 2-0 South Africa.\n\n18.31\n\nNigeria awarded a penalty after the South African goalkeeper fouled Salami, the Nigerian 9.\n\n18.24\n\n24\" Nigeria 1-0 South Africa\n\n18.22\n\nGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL! Chrisantus Uzoenyi puts Nigeria ahead with an excellent \nstrike.\n\n18.14\n\nThe South African were unable to convert their spot kick. The Nigerian side have also missed clear opportunities to \nput themselves ahead of the South Africans after a cross by Ede was missed by an unmarked striker.\n\n18.08\n\n\n\nBoth sides seem to have started very well today, better than each other's previous matches. But a free kick is \nawarded to the South African side near the Nigerian 18 yard box after a Nigerian defender badged into an \nopponent.\n\n18.03\n\nMatch has began. Nigeria is playing goalkeeper Agbim in the lineup. One minute into the match.\n\n15.07\n\nCoscharis: To the best of my knowledge, we followed all due process. We were interviewed by SSS. We were \ninterviewed by the National Security Adviser. Every due process by law was followed. \"We do business with \nmorality,\" he says. Another Coscharis official: Armoured cars are in levels; Level B7 is the highest for any \ncivilian/VIP armoured cars. More than that is for military tanks. Coscharis: The controversial cars are level B7. The \nBMW 760 series, bought by NCAA, goes for 418 thousand Euro from factory without shipping cost, taxes, etc. \nCoscharis offers to demonstrate a powerpoint to show how it arrived at the cost. But is disallowed by committee.\n\n14.55\n\nCoscharis' Maduka: \"People have spoken, different media have written, I kept quiet. Nobody has called me to ask \nanything. But I thank God for this opportunity to state my own side of the story.\" \"People have called me from US \nembassy to ask when did you start money laundering.\" He says the whole controversy is \"politically motivated\". He \npleads to be allowed to speak. Mr Maduka said the matter is so important that his Uncle died and will be buried \ntomorrow, but he has to attend the sitting. He said he is prepared to give details how Coscharis arrived at the \nprice.\n\n14.46\n\nFirst Bank asked to step aside. Coscharis takes over. Coscharis chief, Cosmas Maduka, calls the car scandal \"very \ncontroversial matter that has made newspaper headlines for two consecutive weeks\" as he takes the hot seat.\n\n14.37\n\nFirst Bank cannot explain how the loan given to NCAA for all its 54 cars climbed from earlier stated N564 million to \nN643 million. The bank claimed earlier that the difference was because the two armoured cars were not included-\napparently untrue because of the cost. Under questioning by the committee, the bank now says only the NCAA can \nexplain the difference; the bank says it was only concerned about what the NCAA as a customer asked for. \"Our \njob as financier are based on what the customers are asking for\"\n\n14.29\n\nInteraction with First Bank representative continues...\n\nFirst Bank: The armoured BMWs were not part of the first order from NCAA which comprised mainly Land Cruisers \ntotaling less than N600 million. House chair, Nkiruka Onyejeocha: So could it be that the BMWs were an \nafterthought? First Bank: That's for the NCAA to answer.\n\n14.24\n\n\"Absence of the minister is a slap on the face of the House,\" Jerry Manwe, a member of the committee from \nTaraba state said, apparently angered by the minister's absence.\n\n14.23\n\nFirst Bank official, Seyi Oyefeso, that oversaw the transaction addressed the House committee on behalf of the \nExecutive Director of the bank. First Bank was invited to make proposals alongside other banks and tender was \n\n\n\nopened publicly on 21 of May, 2013 in the presence of other banks and media First Bank was afterwards \nshortlisted alongside 7 others. First Bank granted a loan facility of N643 million for purchase of assorted cars.\n\n14.19\n\nThe Customs representatives at the hearing said Coscharis lied to the Ministry of Finance and NSA, making them \nto believe that the cars were for Lagos state government, for the National Sports festival. The NSA office issued \nEnd User certificate without knowing that it was doing so for cars to be delivered to Stella Oduah or the NCAA. So, \nin a way, the NSA office is right to have told PREMIUM TIMES it did not issue end user certificate for any bullet \nproof cars for Minister Oduah and the NCAA.\n\n14.11\n\nDeputy Comptroller General of Customs, Manasa Daniel Jatau, said the following\n\nThe two cars were imported through Tin Can Port 2; Imported from Antwerp Netherlands. The vehicles were \ncleared 19/6/2013. Coscharis imported the cars without paying import duties since there was a waiver from the \nministry of finance. Coscharis obtained the waiver claiming the armoured cars were part of 300 vehicles imported \nfor the Sports festival in Lagos last year, and therefore the beneficiary was Lagos state government. The due \nimport duty should have been N10.1 million. The cars had an End User Certificate from the NSA office in the name \nof Coscharis. The waiver obtained by Coscharis was for one year; as such the time of importation this year was \ncovered. Customs admit its laws requires that it enforces duty on any item for which waiver was obtained, which \nwas not used for the purpose stated-in this case, for Sports festival.\n\n13.53\n\nCar dealers as well as end users of armoured cars are mandated to seek authorization from the office of the \nNational Security Adviser, NSA, before ordering or importing such vehicles into Nigeria. Last week, reliable sources \nat the office of the NSA told PREMIUM TIMES no authorization certificate was ever issued to either Minister Oduah \nor the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, to procure the controversial vehicles.\n\n13.50\n\nNigerian Customs confirmed that the two cars were imported and cleared at Tin Can 2. The Customs said the \nimport duty on the two cars which should have been N10 million plus were not paid because there was a waiver \nnote issued by the finance ministry. Customs also confirmed there was an End User certificate issued by the office \nof the National Security Adviser, NSA.\n\n13.43\n\nThe hearing, proposed to start at noon, started 25 minutes late. The minister is absent at the hearing. The \ncommittee said it will take a position on that later.\n\n16.01\n\nThe communique of the summit, the last task of the summit, not ready yet. It will be produced and disseminated \"in \ndue course\". Trust you will have you copy here at PREMIUM TIMES.

The Sultan of Sokoto, and the former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku \nAbubakar, have spoken. A tea break will follow, and lead into the breakout sessions where the main brainstorming \nwill take place.\n\n11.52\n\nAtiku Abubakar is next to speak. \"If unity schools must remain federally owned, we must quickly reverse the trend \nof its localisation,\" -- Atiku\n\n11.49\n\nSultan Abubakar addresses the summit. He is an old boy of Barewa College Zaria. Barewa College is not a Federal \nGovernment College, but \"Superior\". [An amusing contest of my school is better than yours follows, to lighten the \nmood] The Sultan ended his speech by reminding the participants that the Sokoto Caliphate is founded on \nknowledge.\n\n11.30\n\nDriven by a need to get a private room at the university, he networked federal government college alumni in ABU at \nthe time and ran for a student union office on their support. Makarfi was little known on campus, but he won the \nelection and got the room. Makarfi narrated that as one of the benefits of attending a federal government college. \n\"It can come in hand for those with political interest,\" he said. He was applauded. Sen. Makarfi began his speech \npromising not to make controversial statements.\n\n11.15\n\n\"Only proper kind of education delivered in appropriate environment will enable us see things in their proper \ncontext. This is what will make us unavailable for exploitation by the elite, who after coming to their wits end, \nwithdraw into ethnic, religious, regional or other cocoons and whip up our undeserved sympathies; because when \nwe are adequately enlightened in their ways, we will then be able to ask them the difficult questions,\" Ahmed \nMakarfi.\n\n11.02\n\n\"Nothing liberates like education... this is because nothing imprisons like ignorance,\" -- Makarfi.\n\n10.59\n\nSen. Makarfi begins his keynote address, shortly after Nnenna gave a short speech to speech to inspire deep \nreflections on Nigeria's education malaise.\n\n10.47\n\n\n\nOby Ezekwesili and a member of House of Reps, Nnennai Ukeja - FGC Owerri- are invited to the high table. \nNnenna sits beside the Sultan, to his right, sandwiching the Sultan between herself and Atiku Abubakar. But that is \napparently an uncomfortable arrangement. She is soon moved to another end of the table. A man takes her place.\n\n10.40\n\nAtiku Abubakar has investments covering different levels of Education in Nigeria. He is applauded at the summit.\n\n10.36\n\nAtiku Abubakar, former Vice President of Nigeria, and the Sultan of Sokoto, just walked into the summit.\n\n10.27\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_147151\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"530\"] Kabiru Nuhu-Koko[/caption] Kabiru Nuhu-Koko, \nPresident General of USOSA.\n\n10.18\n\nAisha Osori and Ahmed Akanbi would anchor the event.

He sent in a representative.\n\n10.11\n\n\"This dialogue is our own way seeking for inputs in the National search for a generally acceptable way of moving \nNigeria forward in our quest for Qualitative/Affordable Education, Good Governance and National Unity.\" Nuhu-\nKoko\n\n10.08\n\nSen. Atiku Bagudu, representing senate committee chairman on Education is invited to the high table, just before \nUSOSA President General, Kabiru Nuhu-Koko delivers his opening speech.\n\n10.04\n\nAgain, delegates stand to sing the USOSA anthem, praying God to unite members. \"What ever God has joined \ntogether, let no man put asunder ...\"\n\n10.02\n\nFebruary 3 1966, the first federal government college was established in Sokoto. The first registered student of that \ncollege, Alhaji Jere, is given a special ovation just before the National Anthem is played to officially kick off the \nsummit.\n\n09.56\n\nMakarfi is an old boy of Federal Government College, Enugu. He has climbed the high table from where he will \ndeliver his keynote address.\n\n09.54\n\nMemories, memories and more. Old mates, some meeting for the first times since they left school exchange \npleasantries as the summit begins to shape up. Up to four generation of Nigerians represented at the summit.\n\n\n\n09.49\n\nAhmed Makarfi, former governor of Kaduna state, currently a senator, will deliver the key not address at the \ndialogue. He is here. Former education minister, Oby Ezekwesili, is also attending the dialogue.\n\n13.54\n\nGovernment reaction to Lagos Plane Crash\n\nThe Ondo State Government received with shock the news of the crash of the plane bearing the corpse of the \nformer Governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Agagu, as it was taking off from Lagos. A commissioner, family \nmembers, associates and other top government officials were also involved in the crash. Information available \nindicates that there were casualties and a few survivors of this unfortunate crash. We are however still expecting \nmore information. No doubt, this is an unfortunate disaster in the life of our dear State. We can only pray that God \nwill visit the State with mercy and give us all the strength to bear these unfortunate losses. We ask all residents to \nbe in a sober and prayerful mood at these trying times as God is indeed the only person we should call upon in this \nperiod. Government assures that further and better information will be released as soon as they are available.\n\n12.59\n\nIn Ondo, government officials were waiting\n\nOndo government officials including Governor Mimiko were waiting for Mr. Agagu's corpse at the Akure airport \nwhen the Lagos Plane Crash occurred.

Also a delegate from Adamawa just told us \nthere was serious drama as Mr. Tukur wanted only delegates from his faction to be given accreditation. But the rule \nis that only delegates who participated in the last convention were recognised and his faction was not in place then, \nrather it was Murtala Nyako's people. It was finally resolved, and both camps were given tags to enable them to \nvote at the election. So far only those from Mr. Tukur's camp have arrived and are occupying one half of their \npavilion.\n\n09.46\n\n3500 delegates vote for 75 aspirants\n\nAbout 3500 delegates are expected to vote at the Special National Convention of the PDP on Saturday at the Eagle \nSquare in Abuja.

He said only the position of the National Secretary will not be \ncontested. The lawmaker said that some respectable Nigerians would be invited to compere the event. A total of 75 \naspirants are vying for the 17 available positions.\n\n18.53\n\nWorld Reaction (Source AP)\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nThe White House condemned the violence, saying it will only make it more difficult for Egypt to move forward. \nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said the violence runs counter to the pledges made by Egypt's interim \ngovernment. He said the \"world is watching\" what is happening in Cairo and urged restraint. The Obama \nadministration has avoided making a determination on whether Morsi's ouster was a coup.\n\nTURKEY\n\nTurkey's government, which has been consistently critical of the military-backed ouster of Morsi, harshly criticized \nthe crackdown. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office called the violence \"a serious blow to the \nhopes of a return to democracy.\" It also blamed other unnamed countries for encouraging the government after \nMorsi's ouster on July 3. Turkish President Abdullah Gul warned that Egypt could descend into chaos, comparing \nthe clashes to the crackdown in Syria that precipitated a civil war. Turkey itself has been criticized in recent months \nfor heavy-handed police tactics in clamping down on protests against Erdogan's government that included firing \n\n\n\ntear gas canisters directly at protesters. Hundreds of Turks in Ankara and Istanbul protested against the crackdown \nin Egypt. ---\n\nUNITED NATIONS\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon denounced the violence and called on all sides to reconsider their actions in \nlight of new political realities and the need to prevent further loss of life. Ban said he regrets that Egyptian \nauthorities chose to use force to respond to the demonstrations and is \"well aware that the vast majority of the \nEgyptian people want their country to go forward peacefully in an Egyptian-led process towards prosperity and \ndemocracy,\" according to a statement from his office. Ban urged all Egyptians to focus on reconciliation, the \nstatement said, because he believes that \"violence and incitement from any side are not the answers to the \nchallenges Egypt faces.\" ---\n\nGERMANY\n\nGerman Foreign Minister, Guido Westerwelle, said the government was \"extremely worried\" about the \"very \ndangerous\" escalation of violence, indirectly criticizing the leadership for its crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood \nwhile at the same time urging an end to violence. \"We expect from the transitional government and the Egyptian \nauthorities that they allow peaceful demonstrations just as we expect from the other political forces that they \ndistance themselves clearly from violence, that they don't demand violence and don't act violently.\" Chancellor \nAngela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the \"decisive principle\" must be \"that the human rights of all \nEgyptians, independent of their political direction and conviction, have to be respected and protected.\" ---\n\nJORDAN\n\nJordan's Muslim Brotherhood has urged its Egyptian peers to continue protests, saying their victory will help the \nfundamentalist group rise to power elsewhere in the Arab world. The Brotherhood's political arm, the Islamic Action \nFront, also warned Egypt's military rulers they have fallen into a \"conspiracy\" hatched by the U.S. and Israel to \nweaken Muslims. \"Today is your day, and upon its outcome, the future of Egypt, Arabs and Muslims will be \ndetermined,\" according to a statement issued before Brotherhood activists staged a protest outside the Egyptian \nEmbassy in Amman. The protesters rebuked Egypt's military rulers as a \"tool for corrupt and tyrant military \nregimes.\" ---\n\nBRITAIN\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said the violence is \"not going to solve anything.\" \"What is required in Egypt \nis a genuine transition to a genuine democracy. That means compromise from all sides - the President Morsi \nsupporters but also the military - that's what needs to happen,\" he said. \"We don't support this violence, we \ncondemn it completely, it's not going to solve the problems.\" Cameron added that he was sorry to hear about the \ndeath of Sky news cameraman Mick Deane in the violence, saying his thoughts are with Deane's family and \nfriends. \"It is an incredibly brave and important job he was doing. It is essential that cameramen are in places like \nEgypt because otherwise none of us would know what is happening.\" ---\n\nIRAN\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry condemned the crackdown, warning the violence \"strengthens the possibility of civil war.\" \n\"While denouncing the violent crackdown and condemning the massacre of the people, it expresses its deep \nconcern regarding the undesirable consequences\" of the events, the ministry said in a statement. ---\n\nITALY\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Emma Bonino appealed to all sides in Egypt to do what they can to immediately stop the \nexplosion of violence and \"avoid a bloodbath.\" Bonino expressed deep sorrow for the loss of human lives. \"I had \nexpressed the hope that the squares with the sit-ins be emptied\" through an agreement among all sides, and \"not \nwith the intervention of police forces, which doesn't help the search for a solution to the political crisis,\" Bonino said. \n\n\n\nShe added that it was essential that security forces \"exercise maximum self-control; likewise, everyone must avoid \nevery incitement to violence.\" Bonino renewed an appeal for the resumption of a \"process of national dialogue.\"\n\n18.50\n\nEgypt's Vice President El Baradei resigns\n\nEgypt's acting vice president, Mohammed El Baradei, has announced his resignation in protest against a brutal \ncrackdown by the army-backed government that left more than 100 people dead. Egypt's health ministry said 149 \npeople were killed on Wednesday in a bloody assault against hundreds of thousands of who held sit-ins to demand \nthe reinstatement of Mohammed Morsi, who was sacked by the army on July 3. But the Muslim Brotherhood, which \nwas behind the protests, says more than 2,000 died. Emergency order has been imposed in many parts of Egypt, \nto begin from 8pm local time. Mr. El Baradei, a Nobel Peace laureate said he stepped down from the interim \ngovernment because he \"cannot continue in shouldering the responsibility for decisions I do not agree with and I \nfear their consequences.\" \"I cannot shoulder the responsibility for a single drop of blood,\" he said in a statement. \nHis resignation is seen as a big blow to Egypt's interim government which forced Mr. Morsi out with the support of \nMr. El Baradei. Reports say he favored more negotiation and dialogue to any use of force, and threw in the towel \nafter his opinion was repeatedly ignored by the military-backed government. The scale of violence on Wednesday \nseemed most bloody since the removal of Mr. Morsi and drew widespread condemnations around the world. The \ngovernment said the decision to storm the sit-ins was taken because the \"security and order of the nation face \ndanger due to deliberate sabotage, and attacks on public and private buildings and the loss of life by extremist \ngroups.\"\n\n15.15\n\nEgypt declares emergency as violence spreads.\n\nEgypt has announced a state of emergency across the country starting at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) as violence escalates \nafter security forces moved in against pro-Morsi sit-ins, leaving dozens of demonstrators dead. The country's army-\nbacked presidency ordered the military to support interior ministry in imposing security, according to statement \nreleased Wednesday afternoon. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that two journalists were amongst those killed \nduring the bloody clash between security forces and supporters of the ousted president, Mohammed Morsi, in \nCairo. Gulf news correspondent Habiba Abdel Aziz was shot and killed, and Sky News' cameraman Mick Deane \nwas shot dead, the news organization confirmed. The 17 year-old daughter of a Muslim Brotherhood leader, \nMohammed Beltagy, was also shot and killed. The figures of casualties remain conflicting, but it remains clear \ndozens of people have been killed. Health Ministry's official gave the death toll as 13; while there is another report \nfrom the health ministry saying 56 people were killed, 526 injured. The BBC said its reporter counted 50 bodies \nwhile an AFP reporter counted 43. Muslim Brotherhood said between 200 and 300 have died. British Embassy in \nCairo has been closed today & tomorrow amid unrest. Reports say two police stations in Cairo and several other \ngovernment buildings and churches elsewhere have been attacked by pro-Morsi protesters.\n\n11.13\n\nScores killed, trains shut, all banks closed, two churches burnt\n\nThe ongoing crisis in Egypt is worsening as Aljazeera reports that pro-Morsi supporters outside the capital, Cairo, \nhave burnt two churches. The supporters believe the minority Coptic Christians in Egypt supported the coup that \nousted former President Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. At least 40 people were feared \nkilled earlier on Monday when Egyptian security forces stormed two pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo. Over 200 people \nhave been arrested as authorities cleared the sit-ins in Nahda and are currently storming that in Rabaa-al-\nAdawiya. A Reuters correspondent saw dozens of people lying in the street with bullet and birdshot wounds. Pools \nof blood were everywhere. \"At 7 a.m. they came. Helicopters from the top and bulldozers from below. They \nsmashed through our walls. Police and soldiers, they fired tear gas at children,\" one teacher, Saleh Abdulaziz, 39, \nquoted by Reuters, said, clutching a bleeding wound on his head. The operation came after the army-backed \ngovernment declared international efforts to mediate an end to the six-week political standoff with Mr. Morsi's \n\n\n\nsupporters, a failure. The Muslim Brotherhood has rebuffed pleas to end the sit-ins, insisting on the reinstatement \nof Mr. Morsi, who was sacked by the armed forces July 3. Over 200 people, predominantly pro-Morsi, supporters \nhave been killed since the former President was removed in July. Meanwhile, authorities have ordered that all \ntrains in and out of Cairo be shut to prevent thousands coming from neighbouring states to join the protests in \nCairo. Also, the Egyptian Central Bank has ordered all banks in Egypt closed as the crisis continues. The Muslim \nBrotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party, the largest in Egypt, has asked its supporters to embark on a \nnationwide protest with protests reported in at least five other cities including Suez and Alexandria.\n\n17.52\n\nJournalists, others barred from witnessing burial of Fashola's father. The burial rites of Ademola Fashola was \nconducted inside a fenced tomb at Vaults and Gardens, a private cemetery in Lagos. The burial was ongoing as at \n4:15 p.m. Close family members and some government functionaries were allowed inside the tomb while journalists \nwere barred.\n\n23.23\n\nAl Jazeera is reporting that its live Egypt service have been taken off air along with several other TV channels. \n\"Reports from our correspondents say this happened during a live broadcast when security forces stormed the \nbuilding and arrested the presenter, guests and producers,\" Al Jazeera said in a report.\n\n22.48\n\nMorsi's office released the following statement as Mohamed Morsi's reaction to the army's statement effectively \noverthrowing him. Dr. Mohamed Morsi, President of Egypt, emphasizes that the measures declared by the Chief \nCommand of Armed Forces represent a military coup d'\u00e9tat, which we categorically reject, in whole or part by all \nthe honest honorable men who struggled for the transformation to democracy.

The \ngovernors, led by Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom, claim Mr. Amaechi's election held earlier was rigged. Addressing \nthe press at the end of an emergency meeting at the Akwa Ibom Government House in Abuja, Mr. Akpabio, leading \nOlusegun Mimiko of Ondo, Peter Obi of Anambra, and others, said the ballot papers used for the election were not \nserialized thus allowing for manipulation. They said they would not recognise Mr. Amaechi's victory and would \ninstead recognise Mr. Amaechi's challenger, Jonah Jang of Plateau, as the Governors Forum chairman. Mr. \nAmaechi defeated Mr. Jang by 19 votes to 16 on Friday at the election held at the Rivers State Government House. \nThe Presidency and the Peoples Democratic Party leadership had opposed Mr. Amaechi's re-election with the PDP \nBoard of Trustees Chairman, Tony Anenih, claiming the NGF had been hijacked by the opposition.\n\n19.06\n\nRiver state information commissioner described her boss' victory over President Goodluck Jonathan's interest as \n\"mission accomplished.\"\n\n19.01\n\nRiver state delegation singing \"it is a miracle working God\" outside and more PDP governors depart the election \nvenue.\n\n18.59\n\nAkwa-Ibom, Bayelsa and Kwara state governors have left the election venue wearing stone faces.

Inside feelers say it is 19:16 in Amaechi's favour and a \ncheery Ameachi sympathizers are jubilating outside even without official results yet.\n\n18.40\n\nYobe and Kebbi state governors are not present for voting.\n\n18.30\n\nThe River State information commissioner, Ibim Semenitari, is seen outside the voting room smiling and dancing \nwithout music. ???\n\n18.19\n\nMr. Jang, the northern consensus candidate for the election, did not submit a letter of intent for the position, as \nrequired by the Nigeria Governors' Forum by-law, before today, 24 May 2013. This has caused a hitch in pitching \nhim for the position, we understand.\n\n18.11\n\nDespite the consensus candidate from the governors of northern states, Mr. Amaechi, the incumbent, have insisted \non having an election, refusing to step down, we understand. Meanwhile, while other governors are locked inside, \n\n\n\nthe Akwa Ibom state governor, have made repeated trips, out and in of the voting room, to make and receive calls. \nObservers are whispering \"he might be giving live updates to the Villa.\"\n\n17.46\n\nNGF Election: Shema, Yuguda withdraw from race Jang emerges consensus candidate of northern governors The \nmeeting of the Nigeria Governors Forum, NGF, where its officers will be elected, has just commenced in Abuja, \nwith strong indications that two candidates for the position of the chairman, Katsina State Governor, Ibrahim Shema \nand his Bauchi State counterpart, Isa Yuguda have withdrawn from the race. About 33 out of the 36 state governors \nhave already arrived at the Rivers State Governor's Lodge, Abuja venue of the meeting where a source told \nPREMIUM TIMES that the Plateau State Governor, David Jang, has joined the race for chairmanship seat of the \nForum. With this development, Mr Jang joins the incumbent chairman of the Forum and Rivers State Governor, \nChibuike Amaechi in the race. The position of vice chairman is reportedly being contested two opposition \ngovernors, Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State and Olusegun Mimiko of Ondo State. Mr Yari belongs to All Nigeria \nPeoples Party, ANPP, while Mr Mimiko is of the Labour Party, LP. The Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi is the \noutgoing vice chairman. It was gathered that Mr Jang, who is about 70 years old, was picked at the consensus \ncandidate at the meeting of the Northern States Governors Forum, NSGF, which held in Abuja on Friday morning. \nThe northern governors met at the Niger State Governors Lodge in the Asokoro District of the federal capital and \nlasted for more than three hours. Both Messrs Shema and Yuguda were advised to step down for their Plateau \nState counterpart by the governors. Prior to the ongoing meeting of the NGF at the Rivers State Governors Lodge, \nthe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governors met at the Akwa Ibom State Governor's Lodge while the opposition \ngovernors under the umbrella of the yet-to-be registered All Progressives Congress, APC, met at Lagos House, to \nstrategise for the election. It was not clear if Mr Amaechi, a member of PDP, attended the party's governor's \nmeeting chaired by Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom State.\n\n18.24\n\nThank you for following our Live Blog of Chinua Achebe's burial.

The body of the writer and poet was laid in state at the auditorium of the University of Nigeria, Enugu \nCampus. There the academics filed past the casket draped with Nigerian Flag. In his tribute, the Vice-Chancellor of \nthe university, Professor Bartho Okolo, described Mr. Achebe as :one of the finest academics that the UNN has \never produced\". \"We mourn him for his unique contributions to the development of our university and for the \nenormous visibility he brought to our university through his creative works, even in death. \"He will be remembered \nas a remarkable teacher, an astute administrator, a creative genius, a story teller and author of extra-ordinary \nability,\" he said. Mr. Okolo said the Institute of African Studies, which he headed and the \"Okike Journal\" which he \nfounded, would continue to serve as worthy and enduring monuments of his career in the university. While \nconsoling Mr. Achebe's family for his loss, the vice-chancellor said that the university would immortalise him at the \nappropriate time. In his remarks, the former Vice-Chancellor of Renaissance University, Agbani in Enugu State, \nProfessor Emeka Okpara, described Mr. Achebe's death as a great loss to Igbo land and Nigeria in general. Mr. \nOkpara, a professor of psychology at UNN, stressed the need for Mr. Achebe to be immortalised by the university \nand in Igbo land for his dedication and contributions to the development of the nation.

In an interview, Mr. Okolo, who represented Governor Sullivan Chime of Enugu State, said the \ndeceased would be missed by both the state and the nation at large. \"We are mourning Achebe today because he \nwas part of the state,\" he said. The President of Ogidi Union Nigeria, Obi Okaro, said Mr. Achebe exhibited true \nleadership qualities, adding that the community would soon unveil plans to immortalise him. A university don, Ike \nNdolo, who also came to honour Mr. Achebe, suggested that a national monument be named after the literary icon. \nThe body of Achebe is expected to be taken to the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus, where he would be \nhonoured before leaving for Ogidi, where it would be buried on Thursday, May 23.

Preliminary reports from the FRSC indicated that a \ntyre from the Dangote truck suddenly pulled out and rammed into the Tanker which caught fire immediately. The \nLuxury bus which was on speed, lost control and ran into the blazing fire, consuming its occupants. However, an \nFRSC team was on hand to rescue 3 passengers while 30 others died from the Luxury bus. The Tanker driver with \n\n\n\nhis conductor, in addition to the Truck driver and his conductor were also confirmed dead. Two children were also \nconsumed by the fire which spread to a nearby mechanic workshop, burning 8 additional vehicles resulting to a \nheavy traffic gridlock. Meanwhile, a detachment of the FRSC, Police and the Construction Company were at the \nscene for intensive traffic control and diversion of route to ensure seamless traffic flow along the corridor. The \nCorps advises road users on Benin road to take Oluku junction - Ifon-Owo-Akure road to Lagos while vehicles from \nLagos are advised to take Akure - Owo road . The FRSC also contacted the Young Shall Grow transport company \nto ascertain from its manifest, that 30 persons boarded the bus earlier in the day from the Jibowu terminus to \nEnugu. Disturbed by the recent spate of road crash fatalities linked to speeding and reckless driving , the Federal \nRoad Safety Corps has concluded plans to evoke its statutory mandate by instituting legal actions against the driver \nand transport operators whose vehicles are responsible for such crashes. Part of this arrangement include the \nCorps' resolve to assist victims and relations of road crash victims to seek compensation from such fleet operators. \nJonas Agwu Corps Commander Corps Public Education Officer For: Corps Marshal and Chief Executive \njonasagwu65@yahoo.com, 08033026491\n\n20.02\n\nThe FRSC has issued another release, saying the casualty figure from the accident is 36, not the earlier annouced \n62.

A Dangote truck and a Young Shall \ngrow luxury bus were involved. The fire spread to a nearby mechanic workshop where eight other vehicles were \nburnt. A nearby local market called also got burnt. The accident caused gridlock on the two carrigeways. Rescue \nactivities is still ongoing and total casualty figure is yet to be ascertined.

From Kano, it's exactly 35 hours 15 minutes. So long guys. Good night.\n\n20.34\n\nI pray my boss gives me another assignment: To blog about a journey from Lagos to Lisbon with a yacht.\n\n19.48\n\n#NoteToSelf: When you get home, soak yourself in hot water, eat hot beans and akamu, slumber, and wake up on \nThursday. Or Friday.\n\n19.38\n\nI must thank God and everyone who has been a part of this journey. And, of course, the real heroes: the frequent \ntravellers on the Second Class coaches. E no easy abeg.\n\n19.36\n\nWe stopped again. At Agege. Goods are being offloaded.\n\nmailto:jonasagwu65@yahoo.com\n\n\n19.10\n\n7:00 p.m. Agege. Bashir disembark. He waves frantically as the train begins to pull out of the station. \"Goodbye my \nfriend. Goodbye my friend.\"\n\n19.02\n\nA brief stop at Alagbado. An old, blind woman, who has been with us since Kano, disembark. A little boy (her \ngrandson?) guides her home.\n\n19.02\n\n#NOTE: A bus journey from Lagos to Kano costs roughly N5,000. And it lasts about 25 - 28 hours. That was by \nroad. Let's leave out the journey by air. Unless someone wants to improve on the witches' brooms for night flight.\n\n19.01\n\nBy the way, that laugh was my first real laughter since yesterday. The coach had been so crowded there was no \nroom to laugh.\n\n19.01\n\nRecurrent and Capital Expenditure 6:30 p.m. We are off to Agege. We are relaxed now in the coach, anxious to \ndisembark. A passenger decides to wind up Bashir and asks him about his 'Fashola Visa' to enter Lagos. Dude \npanics and turns to me, helplessly. \"Is it true?\" Hahaha!\n\n18.07\n\nOk, that was a bit exaggerated. If you have a 90 seater Second Class coach, that means you've got 90 passengers \nall seated. Then the 18 rows in the coach can conveniently take, at least, 20 people; that's 110. Then another 10 \npeople crowded outside the toilet's door and the gangway and you have about 120 people per coach.\n\n18.04\n\nI wonder why those bus preachers have not thought taking their messages to the trains where they'll have a larger \ncongregation. Ideally, each Second Class coach should contain 90 people comfortably - or uncomfortably - seated. \nBut just my coach carried about 5,000 passengers last night.\n\n17.11\n\n4:50 p.m. We are on the move. Goodbye Abeokuta. 1029km from Kano. But I'll prefer to say it's 97km to Iddo, \nLagos.\n\n16.46\n\nEn route Abeokuta from Ibadan, we passed a long stretch of thick bushes. If a lion is hot on your heels here and \nyou are frantically dialling 767, forget it. Telecom networks don't get to the bush.\n\n16.45\n\nJust thought of Bob. As kids, we used to dream of racing each other on the roof of a moving train. And how the first \nto get to the last coach would leap into the bush, just like they do in movies. If he was here we'd probably have \nridden together. And we'd have smiled at such childish wishes. R.I.P brother. #LetsEradicateSickleCellAnaemia\n\n16.44\n\nTo Elisha: No. After this ride, I do not want a state pardon for my future crimes. I demand the title of GCON. And I \nwill never settle for less.\n\n\n\n16.44\n\nDuring an exclusive interview with David Ndakotsu, Assistant Director, Public Relations, Nigeria Railway \nCorporation; he told me that they were already working on extending the rail lines beyond Kano - up to Maiduguri. \nWe've now spent 31 and a half hour away from Kano.\n\n15.22\n\nTicket inspectors making the rounds again. Little Audu, who had been standing since I noticed him at Offa, is fast \nasleep.\n\n15.02\n\nStill on Audu, a woman in our coach volunteers to take him home. And when she'd be getting back to Kaduna, in \nthree weeks, she would take the boy back to his parents at Minna.\n\n15.01\n\nA young boy, Audu, joins us in our coach. He says he doesn't know how old he is, but he looks 10; and he doesn't \nunderstand English. He had joined the train at Minna, heading to Lagos. He is running away from home.\n\n15.00\n\nThe yellow and black flag is up. We are on the move again. After two hours and thirty minutes.\n\n15.00\n\nThe Lagos-Ilorin train just arrived and crosses to an adjacent rail line. The coast is clear now.\n\n14.08\n\nWe've been at Ibadan for over one and a half hour. A railway official tells me we are waiting for the Lagos-Ilorin \ntrain to pass before we start heading to Abeokuta. To avoid a head on collision.\n\n13.44\n\nBack in Zaria, children watch the train as it slowly grinds to a halt.\n\n12.57\n\nEhen. Where's that railway guy that told us at 7:30 a.m. that we'd hit Lagos in three hours? I wonder if he was \nsleep-talking then. It's approaching 1 p.m. And we've still got, give or take, four hours between Ibadan and Lagos.\n\n12.37\n\nQuote Of The Day: A 'high' railway official to one of the ABU students (a guy) at the bar, last night. \"I like you, my \ndaughter. You are a good dancers.\"\n\n12.18\n\n12:00 p.m. Ibadan. 933km from Kano. We've now done exactly 27 hours on the rail. Lagos is 193km away.\n\n12.03\n\nWe pass through school built near the rail line at Bodija, school children come out to wave at us. The train snakes, \ngradually, towards the Ibadan station.\n\n12.01\n\n\n\nThe crowd and the load in my coach has thinned. But not enough to get everyone seated. Some folks still standing \non the aisle. I join my guys on our two seater, three of us uncomfortably seated. I have a photo...\n\n11.50\n\nHow does it feel to jump out of a moving train? Anybody knows? I actually paid for a seat in this train. I'm returning \nto my coach.\n\n10.01\n\nI am not sure I told you earlier that Bashir paid N2,000 for his first ever train ride from Kaduna to Lagos, Second \nClass.\n\n09.59\n\nBeen chatting with the heir to my seat, Bashir Yusuf, 20. It's his first time on a train. He says he's headed to Agege, \nLagos, to visit a friend and would return to Kaduna next week. I ask him if he'd like ride the train again. \"Kai! No. I \nwill follow Marco Polo (bus). I'll pay for attachment, N2,000.\"\n\n09.55\n\n9:40 a.m. Slowly, we pull out of Oshogbo station. The next three stops are Ede, Iwo, and Ibadan. In that order.\n\n09.31\n\nOshogbo 9:25 a.m. From where I am standing, I can hear a garage voice screaming Oshogbo-Lagos. I am tempted \nstrongly.\n\n09.15\n\n9:00 a.m. Still headed to Oshogbo. We've now completed 24 hours.\n\n08.39\n\nDoes anyone notice the look on the faces of air hostesses when they draw the curtains that separate the Business \nClass from Economy? Well, this one is slightly different. The railway guy, stationed in First Class, that comes to \nshut the door separating the from the bar and the rest of the coaches always has a very serious look on his face.\n\n08.37\n\nThe thought of Lagos just made me remember my manners. Good morning guys.\n\n08.17\n\n8:10 a.m. We are on the move. Next three stops would be Inisa, Oshogbo, and Ede. In that order.\n\n08.15\n\nSo far, I've carefully avoided a real meal since yesterday. On second thoughts, I decide not to describe the toilets in \nSecond Class coaches. For the sake of folks who may be having breakfast at this hour.\n\n08.14\n\nBreakfast at Offa.\n\n07.53\n\nAt Offa, a railway official tells us we'd hit Lagos in three hours. I'd say this is the real Good News. If it's true.\n\n\n\n07.52\n\nOffa. 7:35 a.m. Seven more stations to Iddo, Lagos.\n\n07.52\n\nBy the way, the students kept thing lively at the bar through the night, turning into a makeshift night club. While \nthose at the First Class retired, afterwards, to sleep at the seats/beds; the Second Class folks stayed to either \nsleep on the bar stools, plastic chairs, or the floor.\n\n07.51\n\nBeen standing for almost one hour. In the bar. The students from ABU, two of them seated on the floor, tell me they \nwere disappointed with the treatment they received from the railway corporation. They paid N1,700 each from Zaria \nand did not get a sitting space. And there was no question of a discount in their fares.\n\n07.50\n\nBut they are great guys.\n\n07.49\n\nOn my way to retrieve my toothbrush from my bag, my immediate neighbours in my coach begged me to return. \nNow I don't know if I should call them friends or enemies.\n\n07.49\n\nWe alight to brush our teeth/pray/relieve ourselves. Passengers/loads disembark. More passengers/more loads \nembark. 6:35 a.m. We are on the move.\n\n07.48\n\n6:15 a.m. Ilorin. Now we are making progress.\n\n07.48\n\n3:45 a.m. Jebba. 688km from Kano. 488km to Lagos.\n\n07.42\n\nI also thank God for my new friend at the First Class coach who'd been charging my phone Free Of Charge. A little \nact of kindness goes a long way, I confirm.\n\n07.42\n\nArrgghhh! My neck aches. Must have placed it in the wrong position during my midnight meditation. Thank God for \nthis restaurant/bar. And for my new friends who never told me to vacate a seat for a customer.\n\n07.41\n\nI made another friend back at my coach. A young man heading to Lagos for the first time from Kaduna (I'll get to \nknow him better later). He'd been standing from Kaduna, and when we got to Gwada (a distance of 123km), I \ninvited him to squeeze into our two seater. And when I decided to flee from the coach, I appointed him heir to my \nseat. Dude was so effusive in his thanks I was really embarrassed. And he'd been guarding my bag with the last \ndrop of his blood.\n\n07.40\n\n\n\nBy the way, I took a couple of shots of what my coach looks like at 2 a.m. I'll upload that when it's convenient. Just \na few photos though, because I had to hurry away before those two fighting women decide to present a common \nfront and come after me.\n\n07.39\n\nDISCLAIMER: I noticed the AIT camera guy had been going around recording sleeping folks. I raised my head just \nin time to see him hurrying away with his equipment, an evil grin in his eyes. If I should appear anywhere in there, I \nwas performing my midnight meditation. Thank you.\n\n07.39\n\n2:35 a.m. We were on the move from Mokwa. Our next three stops would be Jebba, Ilorin, and Offa. Ironically, the \nlast town is now sounding like it's sitting next to Lagos. It's not.\n\n07.37\n\n...I have never been to hell but based on literatures, but if there is a train there, then that would be my coach. Folks \nusing hand fans to blow themselves and their kids - furiously. Just two minutes there and I already started \nsweating. And then there was a shouting match between two women. At 2 a.m.? Chai!\n\n07.36\n\nPhew! Now let me describe what happened when I decided to check out how folks at my coach were faring at 2:20 \na.m (remember I'd taken refuge at the bar): Passengers sit on the floor around the kitchen (forcing the cook to take \nup the strategic position again at the kitchen door - as she did when we were coming); the loads at the gangway \nbetween the restaurant and the first Second Class coach had grown into a mountain (I had to climb with both hands \nto get access to my coach)...\n\n07.35\n\nAs you can imagine, it's been a long night.\n\n22.22\n\n#NOTE: If you are trying to make an online booking to any of the train routes of the Nigeria Railway Corporation; \nYOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.\n\n22.21\n\n#NOTE: Only the seats in First Class are numbered, making it easy to make a reservation. The seats in the \nSecond Class coaches are not numbered. It's a case of who goes to the stream early... Part of the reasons I fled \nfrom my coach was that I was seated right next to the toilet. *sighs*\n\n22.20\n\n#NOTE: The only way you are guaranteed a seat on the Lagos-Kano/Kano-Lagos route is if you begin the journey \nat the starting points. Or if you know someone that would help you pay and reserve a seat in the First Class at the \nstarting points, and then you join when the train arrives at your station. Or if you know someone that knows \nsomeone who can help you pay and reserve...\n\n22.19\n\nLet me say this: I've fled from by seat at my coach. There was a strong smell of rotten onions that almost reduced \nme to tears. I've taken refuge at the good ol' bar. And pondering how I'd look like if I were to order two chilled \nsachet water and pouring them into an empty bottled water. Dilemma.\n\n\n\n21.50\n\n...Do not misuse or mess up the toilet(s). Ensure that you flush it immediately you used it. Do not enter or board a \ncoach with only one hand. Enter or board it with your two hands, holding the hand rails firmly.\n\n21.49\n\nFor Your Information. Some of the Don'ts of the Nigeria Railway Corporation: Do not stand at the entrance to a \ncoach or gangway between coaches when train is in motion. Do not pull the safety chain inside a coach. It will \nmake the train to come to a sudden stop...\n\n21.48\n\nWe are on the move again. By the way, Zungeru is 441km from Kano. To get to Zungeru from Kano, First Class \nseater folks would have to cough out N1,125. First Class sleeper costs N1,950. Second Class costs N750.\n\n21.36\n\nZungeru. 9:30 a.m.\n\n21.36\n\nI don't know if I'd told you guys about a young man who was arrested in one of the Second Class coaches and \nhandcuffed in both hands, earlier this evening. A police officer told me that \"after taking 'gum,' he wanted to break \nsomebody's head.\"\n\n21.10\n\nI didn't mention that the students who joined us in Zaria practically turned our dear bar into a night club. But I \nauthoritatively say that three of them are on the brink of passing out into 'stupordom.'\n\n21.08\n\nMy new friend, the railway staff who craved anonymity (he actually craved anonymity) told me that he had spent 13 \nyears at the Nigeria Railway Corporation working in trains. He has NEVER (emphasis) entered a Second Class \ncoach.\n\n21.05\n\nI'm playing back the look on the face of my new friend (a railway staff) when I informed him that I intend to travel \nSecond Class. \"How can you come with First Class and now you want to stay in that horrible place.\"\n\n19.58\n\n7:55 p.m. We are on the move again. From Minna. Our next stop will see us almost at the halfway mark of the \njourney. At Mokwa, 598 km from Kano.\n\n19.58\n\nThirdly, standing outside the coach and watching the guys in First Class have unfettered access to the \nbar/restaurant; it's almost like a kid trekking to school and seeing his fellow kids chat excitedly inside their school \nbus.\n\n19.57\n\n7:50 p.m. We've now spent exactly one hour at Minna. Two things, firstly, the GEJ coach had to be detached to be \nrefuelled before it would be re-attached again. Secondly, the Second Class access door to the restaurant/bar had \nbeen locked since the one hour that we stopped.\n\n\n\n19.56\n\nA shouting match going on inside my coach now. Over seating space. And standing space too.\n\n19.36\n\nJust walked past the door of one Second Class coach, the gush of hot air from within almost melted my glasses. By \nthe way, we are still awaiting the head coach to finish its refueling.\n\n19.06\n\nWe stopped to refill the Dr. Goodluck Jonathan Diesel Electric Locomotive.\n\n19.04\n\n6:50 p.m. We stop. Minna, 383km from Kano.\n\n18.49\n\nAs if to distract the passengers, there is a loud voice at the end of the coach: A mobile salesman! \"Pimples, \neczema, toilet infections, lapa lapa, rashes...\"\n\n18.47\n\nNews of the bomb blast filters in. New Road, Sabon Gari, Kano. Terror on everyone's face.\n\n18.47\n\nBack to my coach. Gosh! My leg room has all but disappeared. The guy squatting on the aisle beside leans heavily \non me, and I'm forced to make a little room to accommodate him on our two seater. And we haven't even gone \nhalfway.\n\n18.27\n\nA little more description again: The First Class coaches sit 60 passengers - 15 rows with two people on either side. \nThe Second Class coaches sit 90 passengers - 18 rows of two people on one side and three on the other side \n(face-me-I-face-you style).\n\n18.26\n\nA power cut. The first outage since we left Kano. The student (it's their first ride, by the way) couldn't believe their \neyes. \"They carry light for train again? This thing must enter twitter!\"\n\n18.25\n\nActually, the bar is relatively less congested, plus it's got music, comfortable seats, lively companies, and, of \ncourse...*coughs*\n\n18.23\n\nOh. Did I add that I received another elbow? This time to my face and it sent my glasses flying to the floor. That \nwas the last straw before I headed out again - to the bar.\n\n18.19\n\nThe Second Class coaches continue to get more crowded. Railway officials go round to collect money from those \ncrowded at gangways and aisles.\n\n\n\n18.17\n\n6:00 p.m. A brief stop at Gwada. 346km from Kano. We are on the move again.\n\n18.16\n\nNetwork has been virtually non-existent on this return trip. By the way, can someone confirm the bomb blast at the \nNew Road garage in Kano, about an hour ago.\n\n15.17\n\n3:10 p.m. We leave Kaduna. To Gwagwada, Serikin Pawa, and Gwada. In that order. I'll see if I can attach more \nphotos.\n\n15.04\n\nThe loads on the gangways between Second Class coaches mean that people can enter/exit through just one door \non one side of the train. Loads have been used to block the opposite doors. To move to the other side of the train, \nyou have to use the gangway of the First Class coaches (which is really not an option). Or crawl under the train \n(definitely not an option for me).\n\n14.59\n\nWhile we wait for the Muslims to finish their afternoon prayer, I'll stretch my legs again. Meanwhile a railway guard \njust chastised a little boy dragging a sack into a First Class coach. \"What is this?\" He asked the boy, pointing at the \nhuge sack. \"Go to Second Class. Got to Second Class.\"\n\n14.53\n\nKaduna. 2:35 p.m. The multitude at the station is mind-numbing. I hope they are not waiting to enter this train.\n\n14.28\n\nKaduna station is always associated with the stench of overnight feces. Why? *sighs*\n\n14.13\n\nKaduna is in sight. My new friends have gone to keep an eye on their luggage. The bar man has locked the door \nleading to the First Class coaches.\n\n14.11\n\nIn addition, the sleepers have makeshift tables in the rooms, and 40 litre jerry cans filled with water in the \ntoilet/bathroom.\n\n14.10\n\nStill on the First Class (sleeper), there are double-bunks, single and double. No, not the boarding house styled \nones. These are more like couches. You are either two or four per room.\n\n14.02\n\nI've lost Internet, so will be updating only text. One of my student pals that had gone to check a friend at the First \nClass (sleeper) has just received a stern reprimand from an armed police officer. Actually, we Second Class folks \nhave NO business at the First Class coaches.\n\n14.00\n\n\n\nFrom the bar, I get a full glimpse of the First Class 'A' coach. All eyes are focused at an angle of elevation - at the \nTV. This life is not fair.\n\n13.39\n\nJust before I finished typing the last post, someone elbowed me on the head. I'm heading to the bar.\n\n13.38\n\nI think there are barely clad kids watching and waving at the train. I can't see clearly. My glasses are covered with \ndust.\n\n13.35\n\n...And these are our fowls\n\n13.32\n\nThis is my coach, Second Class.\n\n13.27\n\nWe left Zaria. 12:37 p.m. By the way Zaria is 140km from Kano. From Kano, a First Class seater costs N360; a \nFirst Class sleeper N425; a Second Class N240. Next stop is Kaduna.\n\n13.25\n\nIf you've got a respiratory problem. AVOID Second Class. I repeat, if you've got a respiratory problem, avoid \nSecond Class coaches. The screen of my Blackberry is so coated with dust I've had to continually wipe the screen \nto see what I'm typing.\n\n13.25\n\nAt the beginning of this trip, from Kano, the first of the seven Second Class coaches was very empty. Now all the \ncoaches are filled such that passengers stand on all the gangways. Except, of course, the First Class gangways.\n\n13.24\n\nIf you've been attentive, you'd have noticed that I have not said anything about electricity. That's because it's been \nlargely regular. Though the fans creak while making their circular motion. (Yes, as a Nigerian, I must complain)\n\n12.46\n\n12:37 p.m. We are on the move again. By the way Zaria is 140km from Kano. From Kano, a First Class seater \ncosts N360; a First Class sleeper N425; a Second Class N240. Next stop is Kaduna.\n\n12.44\n\nBeen speaking with some dudes at one of the Second Class coaches. Five young men jammed at the gangway \nbetween two Second Class coaches. They'd paid N1,700 from Zaria to Lagos but nowhere to sit. I advise to stroll to \nthe bar, when they get tired of standing, to rest their bodies. \"Bar? There is a bar?\" One asks excitedly. I've got \nanother company.\n\n12.43\n\nWe are still at the Zaria Station. Folks loading/unloading their goods. I'm taking a long stroll outside the train to \nstretch my legs. There's barely enough leg room at my seat - everywhere cramped with sacks. But I'm keeping a \nwary eye at the dude with the flag, ready to do an Usain Bolt as soon as he waves the yellow and black.\n\n\n\n12.42\n\nWe were greeted by a dusty haze as we hit Zaria. 12 p.m.\n\n12.19\n\nZaria station. Passengers disembarking. Passengers embarking. Second Class Only.\n\n12.03\n\nNow if you are coming from Lagos. And, after you'd waited on the long queue for one hour, they collect your \nN2,000, instead of the stipulated N1,930 to Kano (Second Class). And you 'mistakenly' demand for your \nchange...\"Oya bring back the ticket. Bring back the ticket and take ya money.\"\n\n12.03\n\nI have to say that the Railway staff at Kano are much more efficient - and friendly - than those goons in Lagos. Let \nme describe two scenarios to drive home my point: At the Kano station, the listed price for Second Class is N1,915. \nBut you'll have to pay N2,000. \"The balance is for insurance and VAT,\" the pleasant voiced lady tells us. Those in \nFirst Class parted with N3,100, as against the N2,875 listed on the board.\n\n11.53\n\nThere are 21 designated stops on the Kano-Lagos route, as against 17 on the opposite direction. We have passed \ntwo stations.\n\n11.51\n\nThe ticket inspectors re back again. Their leader takes one look at the toilet and loses his temper. \"Who is the \nowner of these fowls? ...Your money is N500,\" he says s Alhaji approaches. \"I just want to pity him,\" he tells us.\n\n11.47\n\nNow, if you are traveling Second Class on this train, it would be advisable to put on a helmet. The luggage kept on \nthe rack above have a habit of dropping on someone's head every half an hour.\n\n11.42\n\nOur friend, the fowl merchant, says he's stopping at Kaduna. From Madobi. He paid N400 for the 181km journey.\n\n11.31\n\nThere is a sentry at the door leading into the restaurant to stop newly boarded passengers from flooding the First \nClass sections. \"All of you, move this way.\" To the second class.\n\n11.29\n\nMeanwhile, some co-travelers have occupied the toilet - fowls!\n\n11.27\n\nTlking of our new co-travelers from Maidobi, it seems they re heading to the market in the next village. Bags, fowls, \nmore bags, and more fowls.\n\n11.17\n\nNow let me clear the air on my so called 'frequent' visits to the bar. I happened to strike up a different kind of \nrapport with the bar lady, so I undertake these 'frequent' trips to ensure she's on top of the situation.\n\n\n\n11.14\n\nSo far, I think we've had more areas with weak mobile network than those with strong signals. As for charging of \nphones, there are two options - the bar and the dude operating the telephone in our coach. I chose the later, for \nobvious reasons. He told me his fee is N100 per session.\n\n11.11\n\n10:00 a.m. First Stop. Maidobi. 42km from Kano. More passengers enter the Second Class coaches. 10:02 a.m. \nWe are on the move again.\n\n11.10\n\nLet me say this again: the train is driven by a 'diesel-electric locomotive', followed by seven Second Class coaches; \na restaurant/bar coach; two First Class coaches (Seater); and two First Class Sleeper coaches. By the way, one of \nthe Sleeper coaches is reserved for the railway staff.\n\n11.10\n\nWe shuttle past a lot of ancient buildings - mud and thatch houses. Also acres and acres of arid lands.\n\n11.09\n\nThe Dr. Goodluck Jonathan had been 'shunted' - in other words, rearranged - before the trip back to Lagos. The \nrestaurant/bar is now jammed between a Second Class coach and the First Class 'A' coach. As against the First \nClass 'B' coach during the first trip.\n\n11.09\n\nRailway officials in for their routine ticket inspection. By the way, I'm flying Second Class. That means I've had to \ncough out another whooping N2,000. 'Whooping' because my tickets says N16.60.\n\n11.04\n\nI'm a bit train-lagged from the last trip. And I haven't gotten the sleep that would balance the body equation. So my \nupdates may be 'slow-motioned.'\n\n11.04\n\nGoodbye Kano. The journey back to Lagos begins. 9:00 a.m. My Notes.\n\n21.04\n\nWe have reached the final destination. I suppose there's nothing more to talk about. Thank God for journey \nmercies. And thanks to everyone who was part of this 30 hour journey all the way from Lagos. No, I'm not \nexhausted. Good night!\n\n20.56\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is the ancient city of Kano. It's exactly 30 hours 15 minutes from Lagos. There is a \ncollective sigh of relief.\n\n20.29\n\nLet me dwell a bit on some of the positives of this Lagos-Kano trip: It's a bumpy ride; you have access to a bar on \nthe go; there's no bolting through a bus' window in an armed robbery attack; and there's no question of emergency \nlanding. If you are going to Kano, you'll get to Kano.\n\n\n\n20.17\n\nThe train is blaring furiously o. I think Kano is in sight. 8:06 p.m.\n\n19.44\n\nWe are on the move immediately. I hear Kano is 40 minutes away. Time to gather my stuff. And settle all \noutstanding bills.\n\n19.24\n\nWe hit Challawa. This is the last stop before Kano. It's 7:15 p.m. That's exactly 29 hours since we left Lagos.\n\n18.56\n\nAs the train snakes its way through rocky plains towards Kano, we pass a community where half clad kids run out \nof thatch homes to wave at us. Presidential stuff!\n\n18.07\n\nSecond Class Standard: N1,690. First Class A/C: N2,530. First Class A/C Sleeper: N4,990.\n\n17.46\n\nJust so you know, Zaria is the last major station before Kano. But there's Challawa in between the two cities. At \nZaria, we had gone 986km from Lagos. As for the cost of getting to Zaria from Lagos...\n\n17.45\n\nGoodbye Zaria. 5:30 p.m. Next stop, Challawa.\n\n17.35\n\nOn the move again. From Zaria. Both First Class coaches have gradually emptied, so we now sit where we want. \nHowever, the same cannot be said of the Second Class coaches.\n\n17.04\n\nSomeone in the First Class coach just told me that the \"toilet is OK.\" Issokay.\n\n16.56\n\nAt the Zaria Station, there is a First Class Waiting Room, flanked by the offices of the Public Relations and the Man \nO' War. I suppose Second Class Waiting Room would be to stand outside.\n\n16.53\n\nFortunately for me, I meet Salisu, a Kano resident travelling Second Class from Lagos. I ask him if he had enjoyed \nthe ride thus far: \"I like it. We are only two on this chair. I'm not a big man. The A/C is for the big man.\"\n\n16.53\n\nWhile we await the Zaria bound passengers to unload their luggage, I make another trip to the Second Class \ncoaches. The first four guys I meet tell me: \"Ba na ji turanci.\" Which roughly means 'I do not understand English.' \nUnfortunately, the only Hausa I learnt after a four year stay at the University of Jos were how to hurl abuses and \ncurses at people.\n\n16.52\n\n\n\nWhile I was discussing bar matters, the train stopped abruptly. ZARIA. 4:30 p.m.\n\n16.46\n\nTo be honest, internet connection has been very stable since we left Kaduna. But matters at the bar had kept me \nfrom updates. By the way, it took me less than two minutes to get to the bar after we left Kaduna. That's a world \nrecord. Still on bar related matters, don't forget that from my First Class 'A' coach, I'll have to walk through the 'B', \nthen kitchen to arrive at the bar. Last night, crowd at the corridor between 'A' and 'B'; another crowd between 'B' \nand the restaurant; and the multitude at the bar were awesome. If you manage to buy a drink, for the bottle to arrive \nat your mouth, you'd have to elbow some fellow.\n\n16.28\n\nOn a more serious note, this train journey hasn't been all doom and gloom. Problem is, every time I try to think of \nthe positives, I remember the toilet...\n\n16.25\n\nJust spoke to a passenger who is heading to Zaria. She told me she was 'deceived' into boarding the train by Oga \nMaku: \"I watched him on AIT last two weeks when he entered a brand new train with a large flat screen TV. And \nthey were interviewing a woman who said she was very happy. Me I'm not happy.\"\n\n15.30\n\nOur train as driven by Dr. Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n15.20\n\nOne dude who was left behind at Gwada, the last station before Kaduna, dashes into the train. He'd used Okada to \npursue the train. And paid N2,000. One Yoruba guy screams: \"N2,000?! Ah!\"\n\n15.18\n\nWe are headed towards Zaria now. 83km and two hours away.\n\n15.16\n\nDid you know that when the train sounds its horn and the dude at a back coach waves a red flag, the train is not \nready to move? A black and yellow flag? Jump on the train.\n\n15.15\n\nThe toilet? Damn! I'm so traumatized at what I saw I won't speak further on the matter.\n\n15.14\n\nDon't know if anyone noticed, but I've tactically avoided the toilet. Actually, I've got a phobia for public toilet. That \nsaid, this journey leaves me with no choice, I have to check out the toilet. Wish me luck.\n\n14.10\n\nThe Locomotive\n\n14.05\n\nJust before we got to Gwagwada, the locomotive stopped before a hill, and then painstakingly dragged all 16 \ncoaches, at snail speed, across the hill. So when we arrived Gwagwada Station, the 'aggrieved' thing just zoomed \npast, without as much as saying hello to the folks there.\n\n\n\n14.04\n\nI haven't gone missing. Just been hanging out at the bar again. *Clears throat* Apparently, Kaduna has been \nshifted to a farther location, we are supposed to have hit it by now.\n\n11.49\n\nOn the move again. From Gwada. Next stop will be the third to the last: Kaduna. By God's grace.\n\n11.34\n\nAt Gwada, these four tubers of yam was bought at N400. How much will it cost in your local market?\n\n11.29\n\nThe power has been cut and coach has gone from warmer to more warmer. We are still at Gwada. The train's \nengine is not running.\n\n11.27\n\nAnother stop. At Gwada. The coaching is getting warmer and so I've shed all my winter attire of last night. There is \npower and the fans are blazing. No A/C.\n\n11.25\n\nAt Minna, we had done 19 hours. 743km from Lagos. A bit of info for those who'd love to come as far as Minna: \nSecond Class Standard costs N1,280; First Class A/C costs N1,910; First Class A/C Sleeper costs N3,300.\n\n11.15\n\nInside the Second Class\n\n10.31\n\n10:26 a.m. On the move again. Spent almost an hour at Minna. Every hour brings Kano closer to this GEJ-manned \nlocomotive.\n\n10.30\n\nIt would seem that the Second Class coaches have an insatiable appetite for passengers and luggage. More folks, \nencumbered with their loads, struggle to enter.\n\n10.29\n\nA cleaner has arrived at our coach. It's about time.\n\n10.25\n\nI must confess I'm getting tired of taking trips to the bar. The last time I tried to get a drink, the crowd there \nmultiplied like there was some kind of meiotic division that occurred while I was away. I tried to get another glimpse \nof activities at the Second Class coach. Going through the bar, I discovered the connecting door has been shut. I \nforce it open, walk through, then discover I can't go beyond the first Second Class coach. Children and bags \ncompete for territoriality on the aisle.\n\n10.23\n\nMy colleague, Dave, who embarked on the same trip last week, told me they were driven by The Dame herself. And \nthey spent 35 hours en route. I hope Ebele shows he is the man on top.\n\n\n\n10.21\n\nDo you know that we are being driven by Dr. Goodluck Jonathan? Yes, you heard right. The Dame's hubby. That's \nthe name inscribed on the locomotive, the frontal coach, taking us to Kano.\n\n10.20\n\n10.18\n\nMinna. 9:30 a.m. A flurry of trading activities at the station. Hawkers from sachet water to bread to egg. The coach \nis almost empty now, people disembarking to get some fresh air. My new friend tells me he's going in search of \ncigarette.\n\n08.14\n\nThe dude from the kitchen is making his morning rounds: gala, bottled water, canned malt and Fayrouz drinks. In \nfact, we just hit ZUNGERU. Learnt the last stop was a \"small station.\" It's 8:03. We brushed our teeth at the speed \nof light. See you at Minna.\n\n08.13\n\n7 a.m. We hit Zungeru. 685km from Lagos. That means we've covered more than half the distance! I wondered \nwhether it was too early to head to the bar. When I made my usual round to the bar at 4 a.m., there was no more \nspace to sit or even stand. The waitress had stretched her bulk across the bar's counter and had slept off. Dejected, \nI turned back.\n\n08.12\n\n5:30 a.m. I lost count of the number of times power was cut and restored, so I stopped taking notes. However, I'd \ntried to take a nap before it's dawn, but a combination of dark forces, including the water droplets from the A/Cs \nvent ensured I failed. I made a mental note to forward a letter, through the official, to the federal government to get \npaid for night guard services.\n\n08.11\n\n1:56 a.m. We hit Jebba. 488km from Lagos. Seven minutes later we were on the move again. 3:00 a.m. We hit \nMokwa. Just when I was beginning to wonder what had become of the ticket inspector, the dude emerged, with his \narmed-to-the-teeth-with-AK47 rifle police officers. \"I know them. So let us go,\" he told his escorts. And they hurried \npast the coach, onto the next coaches.\n\n08.09\n\nSo by 1:30 a.m, when I sauntered - or staggered - back to my coach, everywhere had gone pitch dark. The guys \nhad, obviously, won the war with the official: they had become overdosed with the Nollywood and needed a lights \nout. With the aid of the light from my mobile phone, I located my seat, my mate had changed to a sitting position. I \ntapped her on the shoulder, gently, she moved, and I tucked in.\n\n08.08\n\nI have to mention that by midnight, the Second Class Coaches had become so overcrowded that folks began \nspilling into the bar and the restaurant. The cook was forced to take a strategic position outside her kitchen's door.\n\n08.08\n\nAt midnight, I lumbered back to my coach from the bar only to discover that my seat mate had coveted my space, \nstretching her legs across my seat and snoring softly under the sheet. A gentlemanly spirit got the better of me, so I \nmade a detour to the bar.\n\n\n\n08.06\n\nGood morning guys. We were out of network areas for the better part of the night... But I'll bring you up to speed on \nmajor incidents through the night...\n\n00.26\n\nJust had a serious discussion with the railway official on the coach. The temperature is approaching zero degrees. \n\"This is a train. Before you enter the First Class, you supposed to prepare for the AC,\" he said.\n\n23.50\n\n11:45 p.m. The train gradually pulls pulls out of the Ilorin Station. We are making progress.\n\n23.40\n\nNow at Ilorin. 391km from Lagos. Again, we skipped Inisha as stated on travel guide. Everyone now complaining \nabout the cold, including me.\n\n23.36\n\nIt's still all quiet. Train is moving, electricity is restored, and everyone's attention is riveted at the Nollywood. I am \ntorn between taking a nap, and another trip to the bar.\n\n23.15\n\nPower restored. The coach is very cold, and relatively quiet. Except for the sound from the movie and that of metal \ngrinding against metal , below, as the train heads towards Inisha, the next station\n\n22.43\n\nWe leave Offa. 10.35 p.m. Power has been cut off again.\n\n22.40\n\nThe bar man pulls out a mop to drain the mess on the floor. Drunk dude staggers from one stool to the next. The \nwaitress, still furious, screams at him to return to his coach. He saunters towards the Second Class coach.\n\n22.37\n\nUnfortunately, I can't get access to the Second Class coach. The multitude of humans hanging by the door, \ncoupled with those standing on the aisle.\n\n22.35\n\nThe train is still at Offa. Waiting. I try to walk from my coach to the Second Class coach. That means I have to pass \nthrough the First Class 'B,' restaurant, and then bar. At the bar, a drunk dude just emptied his stomach's content \nonto the waitress' table. She is furious.\n\n22.19\n\nWe hit Offa. 346km from Lagos. Power is still on, so the coach is incredibly cold. Almost everyone has a cloth \ndraped over her body. No blanket is offered by the train company - yet.\n\n22.06\n\nHere is our electricity story over the last hour. Restored at 9:09 p.m. Cut at 9:13 p.m. Restored at 9:43 p.m. Cut at \n9:50 p.m. Restored at 10:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n22.00\n\nSpeaking of electricity, it has been restored. 30 minutes after it went off. The drops stop whenever electricity is cut.\n\n21.59\n\nDroplets of water, from the air conditioner's vent have been dropping on my head so much so that I am considering \nbuying an \"umblerra\" at the next stop.\n\n21.44\n\nWe've lost electricity - again. The entire coach is now in darkness, and quiet.\n\n21.42\n\nLet me rewind to some notable incidents that happened when I lost contact with the entire world. Before we got to \nOshogbo. An elderly market woman who joined us at Ibadan, had occupied a dark space between the two first \nclass coaches. Sprawled on top of her sacks and lost in sleep.\n\n21.32\n\nThere is a man, a couple actually, who would have thanked God if that woman was left behind. They are heading to \nMinna, bought First Class ticket at Ibadan, but there is no seat for them. The man is at the back of our coach, his \nwife is some where nearby. But divided they stand.\n\n21.25\n\nThe train pulls out of Oshogbo station (9:09 p.m.) . A woman beside me sprints into the coach, breathless. She \nsays she has disembarked to 'gist' with her daughter who lives in Oshogbo . And this 'heavenly' train nearly left her \nbehind.\n\n21.13\n\nCONFIRMED: This is Oshogbo. 293km from Lagos. So if you paid N510 for Second Class and N760 for First \nClass, this is your lst bus stop. Sorry, Train stop.\n\n21.07\n\nHold on a minute. Stepping off the train to confirm this is Oshogbo. Because I don't want to say one thing now, and \nmy Oga at the top will say it's another thing...\n\n21.04\n\nCORRECTION: I've just learnt that the station we just pulled into is Oshogbo. That means we skipped Iwo and Ede, \naccording to the manifest. So WELCOME TO OSHOGBO.\n\n21.01\n\nI hear a lot of folks have missed me. *blushes heavily*. We've lost sight of telecom masts again. But we've left \nIbadan according to my earlier blog post, and headed Iwo, the next station. 241km from Lagos. By the way, I will be \nblogging text only until further notice.\n\n20.54\n\nBen has lost internet on his phone. The train is currently snaking through the Osun forests. Next station is Iwo. He \nwill resume multimedia updates as soon as the next 3g area.\n\n19.27\n\n\n\nThis is what happens: as the train pulls out of each station, officials and those armed-to-the-teeth-with-AK47 rifle \npolice officers, go around the coaches for a fresh inspection of tickets.\n\n19.25\n\nI have to reiterate that meals/drinks are PAY AS YOU EAT/DRINK. The drink is actually 'pay before service.' A \nround faced lady sits before a padlocked fridge, unlocks it to remove a drink, and re-locks immediately. As for the \nbar, they have assorted beer and spirits. That's all. Just in case you are wondering, the train has a restaurant and \nbeer on board. An entire coach jammed between a First Class Coach and a Second Class Coach. The restaurant \nhas a kitchen that prepares all the meals I listed earlier.\n\n19.03\n\nWe are on the move again. Power is back. Everyone is happy again. Except the guys in First Class A/C 'B' - we \npaid the same fare, yet they don't get Nollywood. They don't have air conditioners too. Incredible! Goodbye Ibadan.\n\n18.58\n\nOk, back to my job. Basically, what happens is that at each station, passengers disembark, more passengers \nembark. And so we are having crowded coaches. At the Second Class.\n\n18.52\n\nIn case you are wondering what happened in '75. My mother was heavily pregnant with her second child. I'm the \nfifth child. Haha.\n\n18.52\n\nWe've stayed in Ibadan now for over 30 minutes. Power has been cut again. Our coach started to feel like an oven, \nso I stepped out onto the gravel-decked rail track, remembered what happened in 1975, and rushed back in.\n\n18.48\n\nOne cabin is dedicated to refreshment. Right now at Ibadan, it's time to eat. The first-class ticket does not come \nwith meal tickets, just a sitting space.\n\n18.24\n\nIbadan! 6:13 p.m. I'm rushing back to my seat.\n\n17.58\n\nSorry for the break in transmission. We've been zooming past thick bushes and trees. No telecom masts in sight. \nNothing worthy of note has happened though. The only notable incident was when Ini Edo shoved a pregnant \nwoman to the floor and thrust a kitchen knife into her protruded belly. A collective gasp rang across the coach. \nNollywood, of course.\n\n17.51\n\nThe gala boy is making another round at the coach, with the same array of confectionery. Except that the canned \nmalts have been replaced by two prominent bottles of Heineken beer.\n\n17.49\n\nOur operator gives us Nollywood again. We are on the move, everything is working, and everybody is happy.\n\n16.44\n\n\n\nAn official, accompanied by an armed police officer, comes into the coach and stares at faces as he walks by. \"We \nare looking for new faces. We are looking for new faces...\"\n\n16.32\n\nWe are on the move again, slowly gathering speed. Everybody in the coach has a form of mouth organ - plaintain \nchips, Ofada rice, gala (this one at N50 company price), boiled egg, etc.\n\n16.19\n\nWe are having a situation at the Abeokuta Station. Incoming passengers arguing with already boarded passengers \nover ownership of seats. I better hurry back to my seat.\n\n16.19\n\nWe just pulled into the Abeokuta Station, 4.07 p.m. That means we've covered 97km from Lagos.\n\n16.00\n\nJust as I finished the last post, the power went off again. And everything else accompanying it.\n\n15.58\n\nBy the way, the train is escorted by a crack team of dare devil police officers armed to the teeth with AK 47 rifles. \nTwo are dozing at the back of the First Class A/C 'B'.\n\n15.52\n\nI'm trying to read, but the lady beside me won't just stop moaning about the Nollywood movie. \"How can Ini Edo \nwear the same cloth for two weeks?\" \"How can Mike Ezuruonye go into a bush bare chested?\" \"The director of this \nmovie is not a pro?\".... I may change my mind and have another beer.\n\n15.48\n\nA little more description of the coaches: The First Class A/C is divided into A and B. Those of us in A are having \nthe sole privilege of enjoying Nollywood-on-the-go.\n\n15.47\n\nInside the first class coach.\n\n15.37\n\nThe scene in Skyfall, where James Bond boarded the train in search of a terrorist, is a film trick. On my short \njourney back from the bar, I smashed my skull, thrice, against the wall, fell into a seat occupied by a couple, and \nkicked a lot of feet enroute. The train seemed to be bumping across a perpetual gallop.\n\n15.03\n\nThe power is restored. The railway staff begins to shut a window but suddenly gets a brain wave. \"Make I leave am \nopen jare. They go still take the light.\" He gives us back our Nollywood.\n\n15.02\n\nOops! A bag, stowed on the rack above, lands on the head of a sleeping passenger. The gala seller apologizes and \nputs it back. By the way, his gala is N60, a 20 percent increase from the market price.\n\n14.56\n\n\n\nA young man moves around with a basket of bread, gala sausage, and canned malt drinks. No, this is not a flight. \nYou pay as you eat.\n\n14.54\n\nThe power is yet to be restored. A staff is going round sliding down the glass windows. Right now the difference \nbetween here and the 2nd Class is that we still have enough leg room. And there are no multitude of babies wailing \nto high heavens.\n\n14.52\n\nWe just hit Agege. A short stop for more passengers to embark. Into the 2nd Class coach. On the move again.\n\n14.45\n\nSo I decide to have a beer. For the road. Alhaji Tanko, standing at the door, tells me the last time he boarded a train \n- in 1973 - to Jos. From Lagos. \"We spent one week before we reach Jos. At Kafanchan, we spent more that three \ndays.\" My beer is suddenly bitter.\n\n14.43\n\nAnother round of warning from the armed guy: \"If you see anybody you don't know in this coach, confront him. Or \nelse they will pick your handsets and bags.\" The train jerks violently and the fans and A/Cs go off. Our Nollywood \nmovie too. But we are moving.\n\n14.42\n\nAnother round of warning from the armed guy: \"If you see anybody you don't know in this coach, confront him. Or \nelse they will pick your handsets and bags.\"\n\n14.41\n\nThis is my first train experience, so I'm wondering why we are on a reverse motion, moving backwards, as opposed \nto facing the direction you are heading towards.\n\n14.40\n\nAnd YES, we are finally moving. 2 hours 15 minutes behind schedule. Say a short prayer for us. For journey \nmercies.\n\n14.40\n\nNeed I add that no official bothered to explain the cause of the delay. Or even apologize.\n\n14.39\n\nJust as I finished the last post, the train's engine went off again. That means, the air conditioners and fans have \nstopped. And the juju music too.\n\n14.37\n\nWe are now two hours behind schedule. And they are still \"repairing something.\" The Juju music is playing now, \napparently to calm our nerves.\n\n14.34\n\n\n\nFor want of something to do, I'll just describe this coach: 15 rows of seats, two people on each side; a miniature \nloudspeaker hung on the wall; a 14 inch LCD (I hope it's working); and seven overhead fans, evenly spaced from \none another. And, of course, the air-conditions.\n\n13.58\n\nAn armed police officer, straight from the 2nd Class coach, walks into our coach (1st Class, in case you've \nforgotten): \"Hmmmmm. This place is extraordinary. You have to pay extra money...\"\n\n13.57\n\nThis train hasn't moved, I just see people in blue overalls, clutching spanners and screwdrivers, and making phone \ncalls. But we are enjoying the air-conditioned coach though.\n\n13.34\n\nIn this photo, I'm looking at those people who have been \"repairing something.\" The train is still not moving - or has \nrefused to move.\n\n13.19\n\nThey have switched off the engine. I'm told they \"are still repairing something.\"\n\n13.17\n\nFinally, there's an announcement. From an armed police officer: \"Whosoever is coming into this coach that you \ndon't know, raise an alarm.\"\n\n13.16\n\nBy the way, the onboard loudspeakers are belching out Juju music. Non-stop.\n\n13.15\n\nThe train is still not moving. No voice from the loudspeaker to tell us the reason for the delay. I overhear a \npassenger: \"they say they are repairing something.\"\n\n13.14\n\nFor the records, I'm travelling on the FIRST CLASS A/C. So I've had to cough out a whooping N2,890. 'Whooping' \nbecause my ticket says 'Lagos Terminus to Kano. A/C 1st Class. Fare N59.70.'\n\n13.13\n\nThere's the Second Class Standard, costs N1,930. Then the First Class A/C, costs N2,890. And then the First \nClass Sleeper A/C, costs N4990. The last two categories have air-conditions (as the name implies), the last one \nhas a bed. Yes, a bed.\n\n13.13\n\nWhile we are waiting for the train to move, I'll just run through the prices for the various coaches - three in all...\n\n13.12\n\nThe railway guys are still checking tickets. And loads too. They tell one passenger: \"Your load is one-five (N1,500). \nThe man opens his mouth: \"One-five?\"\n\n13.12\n\n\n\nApparently, the coach is internet-challenged. Been finding it hard to get a connection. The train just crawled a few \nmetres and stopped. The railway staff are now checking passengers' tickets.\n\n14.59\n\nThese are some of the parties participating in the FCT Area Council Elections Peoples Democratic Party, Congress \nfor Progressive Change, All Progressive Grand Alliance, All Nigeria peoples Party, Labour Party, Action Congress \nof Nigeria, National Conscience Party\n\n14.53\n\nA total of 269 candidates are vying for the 62 chairmanship, vice chairmanship, and councillorship seats in the six \nArea Councils of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, all drawn from 13 political parties.\n\n08.12\n\nPope Francis' schedule for coming days Pope Francis' papacy will commence with Mass on Thursday, March 14 in \nthe Sistine Chapel together with the cardinals at 5 p.m. Pope Francis will pay a private visit to Santa Maria \nMaggiore the same day, where he will ask for the Blessed Virgin's protection and intercession during his pontificate. \nOn March 15 at 11 a.m. he will officially welcome and address the cardinals, both those who elected him and those \nwho are over 80. On Saturday March 16, Pope Francis will hold an audience for journalists and media \nrepresentatives in the Paul VI Hall. He will give an Angelus address on Sunday. Pope Francis' inauguration as \nBishop of Rome will be held Tuesday, March 19 at St. Peter's Square.\n\n08.03\n\nThe Pope would be known as Pope Francis, not Pope Francis the First, a statement from the Vatican has said.\n\n21.00\n\nThe new Pope cooks for himself.\n\n20.49\n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio, now Pope Francis I, was Archbishop of Buenos Aires. He is a Jesuit and is 76. He is the first \nLatin American Pope and the first Jesuit Pope. In 2005, he received the second-most votes in the conclave the \nelected Pope Benedict. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1958, and obtained a licentiate in philosophy. He was \nordained a priest in 1969, and was a theology professor. He was a provincial leader for the Society and a seminary \nrector.\n\n20.44\n\nPope Francis is a conservative and strongly opposed to abortion and gay right. He is considered as a prefect that \nwill protect the catholic teaching from external influences. He has been known to criticize priests who refuses to \nbaptize children born out of wedlock.\n\n20.35\n\nPope Francis asks for prayers as he embark on his Papacy journey.\n\n20.32\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_124589\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"465\"] Jorge Bergoglio, New Pope Francis[/caption]\n\n20.31\n\n\n\nProfile: Pope Francis Born: Dec. 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Education: Studied at Theological Faculty of \nSan Miguel. Received licentiate in philosophy. Ordained for the Jesuits on Dec. 13, 1969. Languages: Besides his \nnative Spanish, Bergoglio also speaks Italian and German.\n\n20.30\n\nThe Pope bows to receive blessings from faithfuls.\n\n20.26\n\nThe new Pope makes his first public speech, with a prayer for the Pope Emeritus, Benedict XVI.\n\n20.24\n\nPope Francis appears, in White papal cap, and white Cassock, waving to a thunderous cheer from the faithfuls in \nSt. Peter's Square.\n\n20.23\n\nThe new Pope will be revealed to the public in no time. Pope Francis has a very high profile in Latin America.\n\n20.18\n\nThe Catholic Church gets the first Latin American Pope, His Papal name will be St. Francis the First, Reuters says.\n\n20.16\n\nThe Pope's Identity has been revealed, the archbishop of Buenos Aries from Argentina.

It was \naccompanied by the ringing of bells at St. Peter's to tell the world that two-thirds of the 115 cardinals gathered in \nthe conclave had come to an agreement in casting their ballots for the new Pope.\n\n20.02\n\nThe smoke came early this time because none of the voting Cardinals were in the infirmary. Healthier cardinals \nmeant earlier smoke signals.\n\n19.55\n\nThe identity of the new Holy Father will be revealed shortly, and he will greet the faithful gathered in St. Peter's \nSquare from the balcony of the basilica after he receives the \"Keys\" from Jesus Christ, the head of the Church.\n\n19.53\n\n\n\nPapal twitter account was reactivated immediately after the White smoke rose signalling a key regard for social \nmedia as a means of outreach by the Vatican.\n\n19.51\n\nNo hint of the identity of the new pope emerged before the White Smoke. The Vatican had taken precautions, \nincluding electronic jamming devices, to prevent any leaks from inside the conclave.\n\n19.47\n\nThe new Pope's name will be said in Latin and then his new (Papal) name after. A lot of excitement in the Square \nas more faithfuls flock in to witness the new Pope.\n\n19.45\n\nThe new Pope is the 266th for the Catholic Church. He will succeed Pope Benedict XVI who suddenly abdicated \nlast month.\n\n19.43\n\nThe new Pope was elected on the second day of voting in Conclave after five voting sessions.\n\n19.42\n\nThousands of Catholics are gathered in the St. Peter's Square waiting to catch the first glimpse of the new Pope.\n\n16.01\n\nFriends of the players, family members and village groups will join the procession to the stadium where a larger \nreception is organized.\n\n15.58\n\nThe Super eagles arrival at the Abuja Airport seems a tad unorganized. Nevertheless, everyone here is in high \nspirits with unending joy.\n\n15.53\n\nA blasting sound of trumpets chorusing victory songs fills the Abuja airport reception as the supporters entertain \nfans.\n\n15.46\n\nSitting at the airport reception, Stephen Keshi is receiving endless salutes, handshakes and camera actions from \nfans and airport staff.\n\n15.43\n\nThe player will journey triumphantly from the airport to the National Stadium where there will be a larger reception \nparty and cup showing. The president will, later tonight, host the team at the Aso Rock presidential villa.\n\n15.40\n\nExcited Immigration officers and airport staff also joined in the celebration, hugging and kissing the triumphant \nplayers.\n\n15.38\n\n\n\nThe cup makes its way into the airport reception followed by the cheering crowd.\n\n15.37\n\nYobo finally exits with cup, and lifts it to the cheer of the mammoth crowd gathered at the tarmac.\n\n15.36\n\nIke Uche, Omerou, Echiejile, Mba, .... all coming down now.\n\n15.35\n\nHere we go! the Super Eagles are coming down from the aircraft one after the other.

They came from a one goal down lead to equalise at \nthe last minute of that match. For Nigeria, the resilience of the Burkina Faso player is not new, but can they stand it \ntoday?
