{"title": "U.S. Ideological Test For Asylum Seekers", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nThe statements by the spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in your news account of recent \nraids on Long Island (July 28) are inaccurate and misleading. Contrary to his suggestion, in the first six months of \n1986, immigration authorities approved only 36 of 449 Salvadoran cases (8 percent).\nYet during the same period, the authorities approved 407 of 708 Nicaraguan cases (57 percent).\n\nSuch statistical disparities have been traditional in U.S. asylum practice - and the authorities have steadfastly \ndenied them and sought to obfuscate the issue by, for example, saying that ''El Salvador ranks fifth'' - actually now \nsixth - ''in terms of numbers granted asylum.'' Such tactics are disingenuous at best.\n\nThe inescapable fact is that refuge in America is distributed on essentially ideological grounds. It is far easier to \nwin asylum if a person flees a Communist-dominated regime than if he or she flees a merely authoritarian regime, \nparticularly one with which our Government has close dealings, irrespective of a poor human rights record. The \nextreme reluctance of the authorities to face this issue squarely suggests that they, too, consider such a distortion \nto be unfair and legally questionable.\n\n \n\nARTHUR C.
