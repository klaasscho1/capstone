{"title": "Immigration: Assimilation and the measure of an American; Immigration reform, making its way through Congress, and the Boston Marathon bombings - allegedly committed by two Chechen immigrants - has raised heated debate about how we measure the assimilation of newcomers civically, culturally, economically, and even patriotically.", "body": "\nIf there were such a thing as a classic American immigrant story, it might sound something like the one Arlene tells \nof her family.\n\nHer immigrant parents each arrived in New York City poor but eager, searching for a better way of life. They found \nwork - and each other - in the garment district; they married, had children, and sent their girls to parochial school \nwhere nuns taught proper English.\n\nArlene's parents told her and her sister that here, in the United States of America, they could do anything. So the \ngirls went to college, became professionals, married, and had children of their own - English-speaking children who \nwould never consider themselves anything but American.\n\nIt is a familiar, almost nostalgic, narrative; one that evokes sepia-toned photos of Ellis Island, Little Italy boccie \nplayers, German grandmas, or Eastern European deli proprietors.\n\nBut there is a twist.\n\nArlene's last name is Garcia. Her parents came from the Caribbean, not Europe. Today she lives in Lawrence, \nMass., a city north of Boston that is more than 73 percent Hispanic. She is fluent in Spanish and English, switching \nseamlessly one recent morning at work answering the phone at Esperanza Academy, a tuition-free, private school \nfor low-income girls. She is married to a Dominican man (albeit one whose name - Johnny Mackenzie - is far more \ngringo than hers) and returns regularly to the Dominican Republic (although these days she far prefers the Punta \nCana resort area to the villages of her ancestors).\n\nIs she assimilated? She laughs at the question: \"Well, it depends on what you mean by 'assimilated.' \"\n\nThat, it turns out, is a controversial question. And it is one that has moved in recent months to the forefront of public \ndebate, as lawmakers wrestle with immigration reform, and as the Boston Marathon bombings - allegedly \nperpetrated by two ethnic Chechen immigrants - ushered in a new wave of speculation about newcomers' ability, or \ndesire, to integrate into American culture.\n\nOn one side are conservative officials and pundits who worry that a flood of Spanish-speaking immigrants and a \nreverence for \"multiculturalism\" have led to a population of immigrants in the US unappreciative of and unconnected \nto their new country. On the other are a slew of academics, armed with studies from think tanks and longitudinal \n\n\nresearch projects, who say that assimilation these days is as strong as it has ever been, that immigrants as a \ngroup are still more enthusiastic about the country than the native born, that immigrants' children tend to do better \nthan their parents by a host of socioeconomic indicators, and that within three generations an immigrant family fully \nidentifies as American.\n\nThis happens across the country, they say, even in regions such as the Southeast that are not traditional immigrant \ndestinations.\n\nAlthough there has been bipartisan support in Congress's immigration reform efforts for provisions to better \nintegrate new immigrants into US civic and cultural life, as Arlene Garcia and her family show, the notion of \nassimilation - or \"integration,\" \"incorporation,\" or any word used to describe the process of belonging - is far from \nstraightforward. To evaluate how and whether immigrants - and, arguably more important, their children - are \nbecoming part of this country involves questions of identity, belonging, and the very essence of being American.\n\nCan you measure assimilation?\n\nIn 2006, Jacob Vigdor, a professor of public policy at Duke University in Durham, N.C., joined a group of academics \nin a series of meetings convened by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.\n\nThe scholars, all with backgrounds in immigration research, were focused on a single question: Is there a way, in \nthe face of an increasingly emotional debate over immigrants in the US, to actually measure assimilation?\n\nThis is no simple question. The 2010 US Census found close to 40 million immigrants in the US, making up 13 \npercent of the population. In 2012, the census determined that 36 million more were \"second-generation \nimmigrants,\" or the American-born children of immigrants. And while much of the public discourse focuses on \nLatinos - particularly the estimated 11.5 million here illegally - the portrait of America's foreign born is far more \ndiverse.\n\nThe country is in the midst of what most scholars refer to as the \"modern wave\" of immigration, which started when \nCongress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. This law essentially opened the door to Latin \nAmericans, Africans, and Asians who had previously been barred by an immigration quota system that gave \npreference to northern Europeans. Since then, 40 million immigrants have come to the US, reports the Pew \nResearch Center.\n\nIn sheer numbers there are more immigrants today than in prior generations, but as a percentage of the population, \nfirst- and second-generation immigrants peaked in the early part of the 20th century. In 1900, 34.5 percent of the \nUS population was first or second generation; last year it was 24.5 percent.\n\nToday, census data show, 12 million immigrants come from Mexico and 10 million hail from South and East Asia. \nAlmost 4 million come from the Caribbean, while 14.5 million come from Central America, South America, the \nMiddle East, and elsewhere. Within those groups, of course, there are huge differences; that \"elsewhere\" category, \nfor instance, includes hundreds of thousands from countries ranging from the United Kingdom to Nigeria to Bosnia-\nHerzegovina.\n\nCategorizing the assimilation of all these different people, Professor Vigdor and the others knew, could prove a \ndaunting task. Even the word itself - \"assimilation\" - had become contentious; in academia it was associated with \nnativist pressures on newcomers to assume Anglo sensibilities at the expense of their own culture and history.\n\nBut as a social scientist, Vigdor was eager to find evidence in an emotion-laden debate. The key, he says, is in \ncensus data.\n\n\"When you talk to some people about immigration today, they say, 'Well, my grandmother came here in 1902, and \nshe learned to speak English, and she did all these things, and the immigrants today aren't doing it,' \" Vigdor says. \n\"And as it turns out, we were able to get a good sense of whether all the grandmas were really like that.\"\n\n\n\nAs early as 1900, the US Census was asking people about where they were born and when they had arrived in the \nUS. Using these markers, as well as other data points such as homeownership, marital status, and citizenship, \nVigdor created an index that calculated a statistical difference between immigrants and native-born Americans. Full \nassimilation, according to Vigdor's work, is when these data points are indistinguishable.\n\n\"Assimilation is a process whereby people come to adopt the various mannerisms and behavior of native-born \nresidents of a country...,\" Vigdor says. \"By being able to track immigrants as they spend more time in the US, we \ncan trace out how that process works. And the process actually works in a remarkably similar manner whether \nyou're looking over the past 20 years in the US or looking at immigration from Eastern Europe at the turn of the last \ncentury.\"\n\nIn other words, a first-generation immigrant will usually struggle with more cultural differences than his American-\nborn child, who will grapple with more cultural disconnect than his children.\n\nBut there are also significant differences between immigrant groups, he points out, more so than between \nimmigrants overall and the native-born population.\n\nIn his work, he developed three categories of assimilation - civic, cultural, and economic - and then combined \nthose categories for an overall assimilation score. By his findings, Latino immigrants tend to be least assimilated, \nparticularly on measures of civic and economic assimilation, which include characteristics such as citizenship, \nprofessional status, and homeownership.\n\nIndians and South Koreans score higher on economic assimilation than on cultural assimilation index measures, \nwhich include questions about language, marital status, and the number of children in the adult's household.\n\nHe has also found that, as a whole, immigrants to the US assimilate far more than those in European countries, \nbut do so less easily than immigrants in Canada.\n\n\"It turns out that almost every developed country has worries about immigration,\" he says. In Europe, immigrants \n\"have a harder time working their way to citizenship [and] immigrant unemployment problems are more acute.... \nEven if you look at a basic thing like homeownership - the home-ownership rate for immigrants in most countries is \nlower than for natives. The disparities in European countries are much more acute than in the US.\"\n\nIn his most recent index, this year, Vigdor found that immigrants to the US today were more assimilated than at \nany time in the past decade. He attributes this primarily to demographic shifts in post-recession America - new \nMexican migrants, who typically score lower on his index, are down in numbers; while Asian migrants, who tend to \nbe from a higher socioeconomic level and score higher on his assimilation index, have increased.\n\nScholars such as Richard Alba, a sociology professor with the City University of New York who has written \nextensively on immigration, are more than a little skeptical.\n\nProfessor Alba says he is wary of indices of assimilation, which he sees as too simplistic to capture the full \ncomplexity and nuance of social integration.\n\n\"They might be useful, but they don't exhaust the concept of assimilation,\" he says. \"To take a simple example: \nWe want to know whether people feel like they belong in the United States. How much do they identify with the \nUnited States?\"\n\nTo get at this more important marker of assimilation, Alba says, you need to find out how immigrants feel. Which is \nwhat the Pew Research Center has tried to do in a number of recent studies.\n\nQuestioning a 'patriotism gap'\n\nIn a survey report released earlier this year on second-generation immigrants, who many scholars say are the true \nmarkers of a family's assimilation or lack thereof, Pew found that the children of immigrants are, in general, doing \n\n\n\nbetter economically than their parents, are more likely to marry and have friends outside their ethnic groups, and \nare twice as likely to say they consider themselves to be a \"typical American.\" (Six in 10 Hispanic and Asian-\nAmerican second-generation immigrants respond this way.)\n\nMeanwhile, second-generation Hispanics and Asian-Americans \"place more importance than does the general \npublic on hard work and career success,\" the Pew research found; they and their parents are more likely than the \nnative-born population - and even more likely than the older adult children of European immigrants from the turn of \nthe last century - to feel optimistic about the direction of the country. More than 80 percent of second-generation \nHispanics and Asian-Americans say they can speak English \"very well\"; 10 percent say they can speak it \"well.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of that very positive data in that second generation report,\" says Paul Taylor, executive vice president \nof the Pew Research Center. \"When you look at values, sense of belonging, things are unfolding the way that a \nsociety that opens its arms to immigrants would want it to unfold. Is everything perfect? Of course not. But there is a \nlot of positive news in that data.\"\n\nThere are other reports about immigrants' feelings, however, that come to a different conclusion. A week before the \nBoston Marathon bombings, the Hudson Institute, which generally researches conservative issues, released a \nreport claiming a \"patriotism gap\" between the foreign- and native-born.\n\nCiting a new quantitative analysis of Harris Interactive survey data, the Hudson Institute's researchers determined \nthat native-born citizens are, by 21 percentage points (65 percent to 44 percent), more likely than naturalized \nimmigrants to view America as \"better\" than other countries rather than \"no better, no worse.\" When given a \nchoice, the native born are more likely to describe themselves as \"American\" rather than \"citizen of the world\"; 67 \npercent of the native born believe the US Constitution is a higher legal authority for Americans than international \nlaw, as compared with 37 percent of naturalized immigrants.\n\nThese statistics led the researchers to conclude that \"America's patriotic assimilation system is broken.\"\n\nA number of conservative columnists jumped on this finding, seeing proof in news reports that at least one of the \nTsarnaev brothers, accused of the Marathon bombings, had felt alienated in and angry at the US.\n\nAll of which gets at a bigger issue when it comes to analyzing cultural integration: Who gets to describe the values \nof a \"typical American?\"\n\nAs Alba points out, a \"typical American\" changes region to region, family to family. The meaning also changes \nbased on socioeconomic surroundings.\n\nIn the 1990s, Princeton University's Alejandro Portes, considered one of the leading thinkers on immigrant \nintegration, helped develop a theory of \"segmented assimilation,\" which at a basic level says that because \nAmerican society is so unequal, there are a number of social places where an immigrant can fit - including the \nsocial underclass.\n\nOften referred to as \"downward assimilation,\" this is when people join gangs and adopt a street culture that is quite \nAmerican, but not the sort of American that the Hudson Institute had in mind.\n\nIndeed, the pressure for the sort of assimilation described by the Hudson Institute can often backfire, Professor \nPortes says. (He also takes issue with the word \"assimilation,\" preferring \"integration\" or \"incorporation.\")\n\n\"Nativists take the position that they don't want any immigrants at all - they want to build fences,\" Portes says. \"The \nother position is to turn [immigrants] into Americans as quickly as possible - this is forced assimilation.... The \nproblem is that the first generation cannot be turned into Americans instantly. And the attempt to do so is often \ncounterproductive. It creates fear and alienation, it denigrates the culture and language of immigrants themselves, \nand it denigrates it to their kids.\"\n\n\n\nNot only does this put the country as a whole at a disadvantage - after all, Portes says, with the global economy, \ncitizens should understand multiple languages and cultures - it also puts children at the risk of downward \nassimilation because it hurts their relationship with their parents.\n\n\"The idea that the habits and foodways and the religious patterns of immigrants are not worth it and should be \neliminated - that is counterproductive,\" he says. \"In the history of this country, groups like Italians and Germans and \nPoles gradually developed a phased integration into American society. And today, elements of immigrant culture - \nthe Irish, the Italian - are celebrated as positive parts of American culture.\"\n\n'It's the texture'\n\nIn Ms. Garcia's household, there is a regular debate over sleepovers. Her Dominican-born husband cannot, for the \nlife of him, understand why their 14-year-old daughter would want to stay at someone else's house for the night. \nThis is not atypical, she said. Dominicans, and many other Latinos, just don't do sleepovers.\n\n\"He'll say, 'You have a perfectly good bed here!'\" Garcia says, laughing. \"I'll say, 'Johnny, just let her be.' And then \nhe'll say, 'You know, if there's a fire, you know they're not going to be worried about Marleyna. Oh no. They're going \nto get their own child first.' I'm like, 'Oh my goodness, can you be any more dramatic?' But then I'm awake all night \nthinking about fires.\"\n\nShe laughs again. It's a far cry from the assimilation debates in her childhood, when the nuns insisted to her father \nthat they speak English at home.\n\n\"He said, with that accent of his, 'Seester, out of the home, you da boss,'\" Garcia recalls. \" 'Inside of the home, I dee \nboss. But I promise you, she will learn to speak good English. But she will also learn to speak our language.' \"\n\nNow she worries that her own daughter doesn't know enough Spanish to talk with her cousins.\n\n\"But this is what's so wonderful about this country,\" she says with a smile. \"It's the texture. The stories.\"\n"}
