EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n        \"Human dignity has been a part of our history for a long time. We\n\n        fed the hungry after World War I, This country carried out the\n\n        Marshall Plan the Berlin airlift,...It's nothing new for our\n\n        country. But there's a pandemic which, we must address now, before\n\n        it is too late,\"\n\n        President George W, Bush, January 31, 2003\n\n1. Strategic Guidance\n\nThe President's Vision Statement describes our aspiration for the future. Our Mission Statement describes our \noverarching approach to achieve the vision. Our Goals identify the actions we will take, then measuring the results \nto determine our progress toward achieving our mission. Our Strategic Principles describe many, but. certainly not \nall, of the principles that have driven our deeper thinking.\n\nOur Vision:\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief will turn the tide of this global pandemic.\n\nOur Mission:\n\nTo work with leaders throughout the world to combat HIV/AIDS, promoting integrated prevention, treatment, and \ncare interventions, with an urgent focus on countries that are among the most afflicted nations of the world.\n\nOur Goals:\n\nAcross the world, we will:\n\n     *  Encourage bold leadership at every level to fight HIV/AIDS;\n\n     *  Apply best practices within our bilateral HIV/AIDS prevention,\n\n        treatment, and care programs, in concert with the objectives and\n\n        policies of host governments' national HIV/AIDS strategies; and\n\n     *  Encourage partners, including multilateral organizations and other\n\n        host, governments, to coordinate at. all levels to strengthen\n\n\n        response efforts, to embrace best practices, to adhere to\n\n        principles of sound management, and to harmonize monitoring and\n\n        evaluation efforts to ensure the most effective and efficient use\n\n        of resources.\n\nIn the Emergency Plan's 15 focus countries,   we will:\n\n     *  Provide treatment to 2 million HIV-infected people;\n\n     *  Prevent 7 million new HIV infections; and\n\n     *  Provide care to 10 million people infected and affected by\n\n        HIV/AIDS, including orphans and vulnerable children.\n\nOur Strategic Principles:\n\nWe will respond with urgency to the global HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\nRecognizing that HIV/AIDS is a global emergency, we will rapidly mobilize resources. We do not. underestimate \nthe implementation challenges the Emergency Plan will face. The task is daunting. Nonetheless, we are \ndetermined to reverse the momentum of increasing HIV/AIDS infections and stem suffering through prevention, \ntreatment, and care. Our strategic plan lays the cornerstone of our approach. At the same time, we must maintain \nflexibility and remain responsive to the ever-changing nature of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Our strategy will evolve as \nwe seek new partners and respond to innovation, input, experience, and outcomes.\n\nWe will fight HIV/AIDS worldwide.\n\nThe United States has been and will continue to be a world leader in combating HIV/AIDS. The President's \nEmergency Plan reinforces U.S. global leadership in three key areas:\n\n     *  Focusing significant new resources in 15 of the most afflicted\n\n        countries in the world;\n\n     *  Consolidating our leadership, renewing our commitment, and\n\n        harmonizing our policy in the more than 100 countries where we\n\n        currently have bilateral programs; and\n\n     *  Amplifying the worldwide response to HIV/AIDS through international\n\n        partners, including the Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis,\n\n        and Malaria.\n\nWe will actively seek new approaches.\n\nGlobal HIV/AIDS is an unprecedented crisis requiring an unprecedented response. The President's Emergency \nPlan for AIDS Relief is the boldest international health initiative ever undertaken by a single country. It not only \nbrings hope through the commitment of extraordinary resources, but, as important, the opportunity to find new and \nmore effective ways to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Our approach will not be \"business as usual.\"\n\nWe will use a new leadership model.\n\nThe United States Global AIDS Coordinator will oversee and direct all U.S. Government (USG) international \nHIV/AIDS activities in all departments and all agencies of the Federal Government. This new approach for the \ncoordination and deployment of resources from across the U.S. Government will result in more effective and \nefficient programs that capitalize on the skills and expertise of staff from across the U.S. Government.\n\nWe will make policy decisions that are evidence-based.\n\n\n\nWe will build on the best practices established in the fight against HIV/AIDS and bring the resources of sound \nscience to bear in selecting and developing interventions that achieve real results.\n\nWe will demand accountability for results.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan will establish measurable goals for which we will hold ourselves and our \npartners accountable. In the focus countries and throughout the world, effective monitoring and evaluation systems \nwill identify successful models for scale-up and poorly performing programs for revision or termination.\n\nWe will implement programs suited to local needs and host government policies and strategies.\n\nWe will implement programs that are coordinated with the policies and strategies of host governments and are \nresponsive to local needs. Countries and communities are at different stages of HIV/AIDS response and have \nunique drivers of HIV, distinctive social and cultural patterns (particularly with regard to the status of women), and \ndifferent political and economic conditions. Effective interventions must be informed by local circumstances and \ncoordinated with local efforts. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will provide the strategic direction, the \"what\" for \nUSG programs. Each U.S. Chief of Mission will lead a coordinated U.S. Government country team to identify the \n\"how,\" through program implementation that is directed by a USG country plan, responsive to local needs and \ncircumstances, and coordinated with the host government's national HIV/AIDS strategy.\n\nWe will develop and strengthen integrated HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care services.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan is unmatched in its commitment to provide prevention and treatment and care \nservices, with the knowledge that these efforts are enhanced through their integration. In the absence of treatment \nand care, HIV infection is perceived as a death sentence, hindering prevention efforts as fear inhibits people from \nseeking testing services and internalizing prevention messages. The availability of treatment and care, in addition to \nprolonging life and easing the suffering of the infected and affected, amplifies prevention efforts by offering \nincentives to seek HIV/AIDS information, get tested, and declare HIV status.\n\nWe will develop sustainable HIV/AIDS health care networks.\n\nWe recognize the limits of health resources and capacity in many, particularly rural, communities. To more \neffectively address that shortfall, we will build on and strengthen systems of HIV/AIDS health care based on the \n\"network\" model. Prevention, treatment, and care protocols will be developed, enhanced, and promoted in concert \nwith local governments and ministries of health. With interventions emphasizing technical assistance and training of \nhealth care professionals, health care workers, community-based groups, and faith-based organizations, we will \nbuild local capacity to provide long-term, widespread, essential HIV/AIDS services to the maximum number of those \nin need.\n\nWe will employ the prevention lessons learned from the \"ABC\" model.\n\nUganda's success has identified the \"ABC\" model (Abstinence, Be faithful, and, as appropriate, correctly and \nconsistently use Condoms) as an effective HIV/AIDS prevention tool. We will promote the proper application of the \nABC approach, through population-specific interventions that emphasize abstinence for youth, including the delay \nof sexual debut and abstinence until marriage; HIV/AIDS testing and fidelity in marriage and monogamous \nrelationships; and correct and consistent use of condoms for those who practice high-risk behaviors.\n\nWe will combat stigma and denial.\n\nStigma remains a primary barrier to combating HIV/AIDS. Fear of disease and discrimination inhibits people from \nseeking and offering information, testing, treatment, and care. HIV travels swiftly and surely under cover of silence \nand denial. We will take leadership, and encourage leadership, in promoting the message that HIV is a virus that \nknows no borders, discriminates against no race, no gender, and no class. We will encourage people to fight the \ndisease, not the people who live with it, and to treat people infected and affected by AIDS not with cruelty and \ndiscrimination but with dignity and compassion.\n\nWe will seek new strategies to encourage HIV/AIDS testing.\n\nThe war against HIV/AIDS begins with prevention. The disease cannot be conquered unless new infections are \neliminated. Forty million people worldwide are already infected with HIV, and each day 14,000 more are added to \n\n\n\ntheir ranks. Alarmingly, the vast majority do not know they are infected and unknowingly pass the virus to others. \nPeople have not wanted to be tested, in part because a positive result was a death sentence. Knowledge about the \nPresident's commitment to antiretroviral treatment and care will encourage testing. Knowledge of HIV status is a \nvital tool for helping individuals avoid behaviors that place them at risk of HIV infection, leading people to protect \nthemselves and others from HIV infection. We will seek and promote new strategies to dramatically increase HIV \ntesting.\n\nWe will encourage bold national leadership.\n\nWhere national leaders have taken early and effective action to publicly acknowledge HIV/AIDS as a problem in \ntheir country, raised and devoted appropriate resources, and demanded broad involvement, the battle against \nHIV/AIDS is meeting success. Through effective diplomacy and communication, we will engender new leadership \nat every level--from national statesmen to village elders--in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nWe will seek the involvement of people infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS.\n\nPeople infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS have unique contributions to make in identifying their needs, \ntestifying to program effectiveness, advocating for an improved response, and combating stigma and discrimination. \nWe will encourage the input of these individuals so that we respond more effectively to the needs of these people, \nwho are among those the Emergency Plan seeks to serve.\n\nWe will encourage and strengthen faith-based and community-based nongovernmental organizations.\n\nFaith-based and community-based organizations were among the first responders to HIV/AIDS, caring for fellow \nhuman beings in need. Their reach, authority, and legitimacy identify them as crucial partners in the fight against \nHIV/AIDS. We will encourage their involvement, and, in particular, we will welcome new partners with innovative \nideas.\n\nWe will maintain our own focus while coordinating with other partners.\n\nOur focus, worldwide, is on achieving targeted goals within HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care. Other \nentities contribute vital efforts to these goals and to combating the drivers and consequences of HIV/AIDS. This \npandemic is one of the most complex crises the world has encountered, and all of these efforts are necessary and \nimportant. Each of our efforts is amplified when we work in concert toward the overarching shared goal of \neradicating HIV/AIDS and the devastation it wreaks.\n\n2. Summary\n\nThe Global HIV/AIDS Emergency and the U.S. Response\n\nThe global HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Worldwide, over 40 million people are \nnow infected, and each day 14,000 more are added to their ranks. In claiming the lives of societies' most productive \npopulations--adults ages 15 to 45--HIV/AIDS threatens a basic principle of development, that each generation does \nbetter than the one before. Four months after his inauguration, President George W. Bush began an historic \nexpansion of the U.S. Government's commitment to global HIV/AIDS when he announced the founding donation of \n$200 million that established the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Shortly thereafter he \ninitiated his International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative and, in his 2003 State of the Union address, he \nannounced his historic Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief--the largest and boldest assault on the global AIDS \npandemic in history. Other global leaders have also taken action against the crisis of HIV/AIDS, and there are many \nsuccesses to build upon. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain. Treatment remains out of reach for the vast \nmajority of those who need it. The lack of basic care and support services leaves millions in daily pain and suffering. \nThe ever-growing orphan population is straining community support mechanisms, with little to fill the gaps. \nInadequate leadership and enduring stigma keep HIV spreading swiftly and surely under cover of silence. \nCombined, these challenges necessitate a complex response to delivering prevention, treatment, and care services \nto the many who are in need.\n\nPresident Bush has responded to the challenge of global HIV/AIDS with his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The \nEmergency Plan targets $9 billion in new funding to dramatically ramp up prevention, treatment, and care services \n\n\n\nin 15 of the most affected countries of the world representing at. least. 50 percent of HIV infections worldwide. The \nEmergency Plan also devotes $5 billion over five years to ongoing bilateral programs in more than 100 countries \nand increases our pledge to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by $1 billion over five years.\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan also demands a new way of doing business that will transform U.S. \nGovernment HIV/AIDS activities worldwide. It makes a revolutionary commitment to providing integrated \nprevention, treatment, and care services to those infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS, and establishes \nmeasurable goals against, which progress will be tracked and evaluated. Policy and program decisions will be \nevidence-based and results-driven. New partners and innovations will be actively sought and rigorously evaluated. \nThe President's Emergency Plan will be implemented under new leadership from the U.S. Global AIDS \nCoordinator, coordinating, in the United States and in the field, the work of all U.S. agencies fighting HIV/AIDS \nglobally.\n\nPresident Bush has demanded that the U.S. Government's approach to global HIV/AIDS be focused, coordinated, \nand accountable for results. It capitalizes on specialized expertise and the strengths of partnerships with host \ngovernments, multilateral institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.\n\nEngendering Bold Leadership\n\nAs President Bush has demonstrated, leadership is an essential enabler for HIV/AIDS efforts, spurring action and \nmagnifying its effects. In highly impacted countries and those experiencing emerging epidemics, leadership is \nrequired from the statehouse to the village to combat stigma, denial, and misinformation; influence cultural patterns; \nand mobilize new partners, action, and resources. For those countries with the means to be international donors, \nnational leaders are in a position to increase public and private international HIV/AIDS assistance. The U.S. \nGovernment, under President Bush's leadership, will use its position and influence to encourage others to \ndemonstrate similar bold leadership that is necessary to win the war against AIDS. Through proactive diplomacy \nand communications, the United States will engender greater leadership at every level in the fight against \nHIV/AIDS.\n\nCritical Interventions in the Focus Countries\n\nWithin prevention, treatment, and care interventions, activities will focus on rapidly scaling up existing successful \nprograms to immediately stem the tide and halt suffering attributable to HIV/AIDS. They will also focus on \nexpanding partnerships; building capacity for effective, innovative, and sustainable services; creating a supportive \nand enabling policy environment for combating HIV/AIDS; implementing strong monitoring and evaluation systems \nto identify best practices; evaluating progress toward goals; and ensuring compliance with Emergency Plan \npolicies and strategies.\n\nPrevention\n\nPrevention remains the primary strategy to combat HIV/AIDS. Despite two decades of focused attention on \nprevention, however, we have yet to achieve widespread success. Inappropriate and inconsistent prevention \nmessages, stigma, gender inequality, poor knowledge of HIV status, limited testing strategies, medical transmission \nof HIV through unsafe injections and blood supply, and HIV transmission from mother to child continue to fuel the \nspread of HIV. President. Bush's Emergency Plan is specifically designed to address these challenges by using \nevidence-based prevention programs such as the \"ABC\" approach of Abstinence, Be faithful, and as appropriate, \nthe correct and consistent use of Condoms. Other identified best practices to achieve real results in reducing the \nnumber of new infections include increased testing; appropriately tailored interventions for specific populations \nincluding women, men, and high-risk groups; the involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS, parents, and leaders \nfrom all sectors of society; and stigma reduction.\n\nTreatment\n\nFewer than 8 percent of the 6 million people in resource-limited settings in immediate need of antiretroviral \ntreatment currently receive it. A strong focus on treatment underlies the Emergency Plan. President Bush's vision \nthat each human life has dignity and that the most vulnerable people in the world living with HIV/AIDS should have \naccess to anti retroviral treatment guides the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's implementation activities. Providing \ntreatment may be our best hope against the disease and the devastation it wreaks. Availability of treatment \n\n\n\nprovides an incentive to get tested; reduces stigma; and, in restoring health, mitigates consequences of the disease \nsuch as loss of productivity, dramatically increased poverty, and growing orphan populations. The Emergency Plan \nwill build on established clinical programs and develop the necessary infrastructure, staff, and technical capacity to \nprovide long-term, widespread, high-quality, safe, and essential HIV/AIDS services to the maximum number of \npeople in need. In addition, it will contribute to the development of appropriate treatment protocols and policies to \nensure sate and effective treatment services, drug supply, and equitable distribution of health resources.\n\nCare\n\nCare services under President Bush's Emergency Plan include both palliative care for people living with HIV/AIDS \nand care for orphans and other vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS and associated opportunistic \ninfections cause severe pain and debilitating symptoms for many with advanced disease. Poor health contributes to \nreduced productivity and diverts meager resources, leading to myriad consequences including diminished food \nsecurity. At the same time, millions of orphans growing up without, the support, of their parents face increased \nvulnerability to HIV, violence, sexual coercion, and reduced access to essential services such as health care and \neducation.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan seeks to mitigate these consequences by building the capacity of professional \nand family- and community-based health care providers to provide palliative care, by strengthening health care \nreferral networks, and by ensuring necessary supplies. For orphans and vulnerable children, the Emergency Plan \nseeks to strengthen the capacity of extended families and communities to care for orphans and to advance policy \nand legal reforms related to inheritance, access to basic social and protective services in order to enable supportive \nenvironments for children's growth and development.\n\nStrengthening Bilateral HIV/AIDS Programs\n\nPresident Bush has called upon political leaders around the world to address the HIV/AIDS crisis and to partner \nwith the United States under a shared vision of human dignity and access to treatment, prevention, and care. His \nEmergency Plan offers a fresh opportunity to develop and implement consistent HIV/AIDS policies and programs \nacross our existing bilateral prevention, treatment, and care programs. By drawing on the body of evidence \ncollected over 20 years, new evidence-based lessons and insights from Emergency Plan initiatives in focus \ncountries, and the U.S. Government's strong field presence and technical expertise, the Office of the U.S. Global \nAIDS Coordinator will work to harmonize in policy and management our bilateral programs worldwide.\n\nStrengthening Multilateral Actions\n\nThe Bush Administration has recognized the importance of multilateral approaches to fighting the global HIV/AIDS \npandemic. The President's early and aggressive support of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria has enabled this important mechanism of funding HIV/AIDS programs to begin to fulfill its potential. The \ncontributions of other multilateral institutions and international organizations working with great dedication to combat \nHIV/AIDS provide a vital opportunity for a comprehensive response. The diverse drivers and consequences of \nHIV/AIDS, and its many complicated interactions with a variety of other social, political, and economic \ncircumstances, demand an equal number of diverse actors with varied expertise. The President's Emergency Plan \ncommits a significant proportion of its resources to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in \nrecognition of the fact that the Global Fund is a promising global force in the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria, and offers important opportunities to address needs complementary to other elements of the Emergency \nPlan. Other multilateral institutions and international organizations, such as the Joint United Nations Program on \nHIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank, have also provided essential global leadership, \nexpertise, and resources. The U.S. Government will strengthen its relationships with multilateral institutions and \ninternational organizations to amplify global action against HIV/AIDS by encouraging coordination, based on \ncomparative strengths, to fill gaps in current activities, avoid duplication of efforts, and ensure efficient and effective \nuse of resources.\n\nImplementation and Management\n\nMeeting the challenge of the global AIDS crisis is a monumental task that will require--along with strong leadership \nand vision--robust and flexible administrative structures. President Bush has set clear goals for his Emergency \nPlan and has insisted that the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's response be rapid, effective, and evidence-based, \n\n\n\nand make efficient and focused use of all relevant government capabilities through coordination, collaboration, and \ncooperation across U.S. Government agencies. It must also reflect administration policy and statute; respond to the \ndiverse needs of the various communities around the world in which the US. Government works; and account for \nprogress toward achieving these goals. Four primary processes underlie this approach:\n\n     *  Coordination. President Bush created the position of the U.S.\n\n        Global AIDS Coordinator, who shall have primary responsibility for\n\n        the oversight and coordination of all resources and international\n\n        activities of the U.S. Government to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\n        The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is thus responsible for both\n\n        internal and external coordination of HIV/AIDS activities. Internal\n\n        coordination is carried out by country-specific response teams\n\n        comprising staff from the implementing agencies and the Office of\n\n        the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. In Washington, coordination\n\n        between various federal agencies is achieved through multiple\n\n        methods of communication, joint project planning, and policy\n\n        development. External coordination with non-U.S. Government\n\n        stakeholders, including host-country governments and multilateral\n\n        institutions, is carried out both through in-country coordination\n\n        led by field staff and through proactive liaising on the part of\n\n        the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator.\n\n     *  Planning. At the core of the implementation strategy is an ongoing\n\n        in-country planning effort, beginning with the focus countries.\n\n        Chiefs of Mission in each country will lead a strategic planning\n\n        process, aided by the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator\n\n        and involving all relevant U.S. Government entities, host-country\n\n        governments, nongovernmental organizations, the corporate sector,\n\n        multilateral institutions, and other in-country stakeholders. This\n\n        process will result in individual-five-year country strategies and\n\n        annual operational plans for strengthening the quality,\n\n        availability, and sustainability of prevention, treatment, and care\n\n        services. Plans will be submitted to the U.S. Global AIDS\n\n        Coordinator for review. Final approval by the Coordinator will\n\n        ensure consistency with Congressional intent, Administration\n\n        policy, and the Coordinator's strategic objectives.\n\n     *  Allocation of Funding. The President's Emergency Plan relies on a\n\n        variety of funding allocation mechanisms in order to maximize\n\n        flexibility and encourage innovation while responding to specific\n\n\n\n        country needs:\n\n     *  Funding levels by country' will be allocated on the basis of the\n\n        country's five-year strategic plan, and funds will be released upon\n\n        approval of annual country operational plans by the U.S. Global\n\n        AIDS Coordinator.\n\n     *  Central funding mechanisms developed and approved by the Office of\n\n        the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will fund regional initiatives\n\n        serving more than one country, such as professional training or\n\n        twinning for which organizations will provide technical assistance\n\n        on a regional basis.\n\n     *  Funding decisions will be based upon performance in reaching annual\n\n        prevention, treatment, and care targets. Strategic information will\n\n        guide allocation of resources for maximum impact and ensure\n\n        accountability to American taxpayers.\n\n Communications. President Bush has insisted that implementation be transparent and accountable. The U.S. \nGlobal AIDS Coordinator will ensure that the public is given timely, accurate, and complete information regarding \nthe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. A variety of mechanisms, including Web technology, reports to \nCongress, and media outreach will serve this purpose.\n\nSupportive Interventions for U.S. Government Programs\n\nInterventions that support implementation of the President's Emergency Plan include an effective and accountable \nsupply chain; a strong research program to provide the evidence base necessary to guide policies and programs, \nincluding a coordinated strategic information system; and enhanced public-private partnerships.\n\n     *  Supply chain management is critical to ensure a secure and\n\n        sustainable supply of quality essential drugs, materials, and\n\n        equipment for HIV/AIDS programs. Supply chain management systems\n\n        will be coordinated with complementary programs and will reduce and\n\n        eliminate diversion, counterfeiting, and the sale of HIV/AIDS\n\n        products and supplies on the black market.\n\n     *  A strong evidence base will provide new knowledge and give\n\n        direction to policy and program decisions. Strategic information\n\n        systems will track programs to ensure they are meeting targets and\n\n        having measurable impact. Best practices for HIV/AIDS treatment,\n\n        prevention, and care will be identified through both of these\n\n        processes.\n\n     *  Public-private partnerships will mobilize the private sector to\n\n        leverage resources and capabilities across all sectors, including\n\n        contributions to building sustainable systems of HIV/AIDS\n\n        treatment, prevention, and care. The comparative advantages of\n\n\n\n        these partnerships will be maximized to complement services\n\n        provided by the public and nongovernmental/faith-based organization\n\n        sectors.\n\nII. THE GLOBAL HIV/AIDS EMERGENCY AND THE U.S. RESPONSE\n\n        \"The legislation [P.L.108-25]that I sign today launches an\n\n        emergency effort that will provide $15 billion over the next\n\n        five years to fight AIDS abroad. This is the largest single\n\n        up-front commitment in history for an international public health\n\n        initiative involving a specific disease. America makes this\n\n        commitment for a clear reason, directly rooted in our founding. We\n\n        believe in the value and dignity of every human life.\"\n\n        President George W. Bush, May 27, 2003\n\n1. The Global HIV/AIDS Emergency: A Severe Urgent Crisis\n\nPresident Bush has recognized that the global HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of the greatest health challenges of our \ntime. Worldwide, over 40 million people are now infected, and each day 14,000 more are added to their ranks. Over \n25 million have lost their lives to the disease, leaving behind anguished loved ones, orphaned children, and \nravaged communities. The burden of disease, pain, and suffering is immense and growing every day. More than 13 \nmillion children have been orphaned by AIDS, leaving families and communities to face the challenges of providing \nguidance, health care, education, love, and hope. These children are often vulnerable to the worst forms of child \nlabor and risk dropping out of school.\n\nThe disease has turned back many of the hard-won development gains of the 20th century, reducing life \nexpectancy, increasing child mortality, and threatening fragile democracies as nations are overcome by political, \nsocial, and economic instability. AIDS strikes at the heart of hope, progress, and potential by claiming lives and \ncausing untold suffering. Some of the most affected are societies' most productive populations-- parents and \nteachers, police officers and government workers, fanners and health care providers. In robbing societies of these \nindividuals, AIDS threatens a basic principle of development, that each generation does better than the one before \nit.\n\nThe greatest burdens of disease are concentrated in developing countries least able to cope. The countries of sub-\nSaharan Africa and the Caribbean are home to nearly 30 million people with HIV/AIDS, nearly 70 percent of the \nworld's total. HIV/AIDS has deepened poverty and diverted state resources in regions already struggling with \noverburdened health systems and populations living on less than $2 per day. It has fueled a resurgence of the \ntuberculosis epidemic, further exacerbating strained health resources and compounding the suffering of those \ninfected and affected by HIV/AIDS.\n\nEmerging epidemics in India, China, and Eastern Europe threaten to become new epicenters of the disease. Given \ncurrent infection rates and limited health services, these regions may compete with central and southern Africa as \nhome to the greatest number of HIV-infected individuals by the end of the decade.\n\nLike President Bush, the international community and many national leaders have taken action against the crisis of \nHIV/AIDS, and there are many successes to build upon. The United Nations General Assembly Special Session on \nHIV/AIDS affirmed the international community's commitment to progress against HIV/AIDS and provided the \nfoundation for mobilizing significant resources to fight it. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nand other multilateral institutions, such as the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and various \nother U.N. agencies, have made vital contributions.\n\n\n\nWe now have proven methods for combating HIV/AIDS, including effective strategies that highlight abstinence and \nfidelity, fight stigma and denial, and partner government with civil society. We know that leadership is essential and \nthat early and effective action can contain and even roll back epidemics. Most importantly, where there used to be a \n\"prevention versus treatment\" debate, today few dispute that we must do both.\n\nHowever, significant challenges face all nations, donors, institutions, and individuals attempting to respond to the \nglobal AIDS pandemic. Treatment continues to be out of reach for the vast majority of those who need it. The lack \nof basic care and support services leaves millions in daily pain and suffering. Limited infrastructure and human \nresource capacity in affected countries constrain their ability to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis overtaking their \ncommunities. The ever-growing orphan population is straining community support mechanisms, with little to fill the \ngaps. Inadequate leadership and enduring stigma keep HIV spreading swiftly and surely under cover of silence. \nInsufficient coordination and evaluation of programs contribute to the inefficient use of funds and ineffective \ninterventions. Combined, these challenges necessitate an extremely complex response to delivering HIV/AIDS \nprevention, treatment, and care services to the many who are in need.\n\nWithout intervention, experts predict that over 100 million people will be infected worldwide by 2010, with a \ncumulative loss of human life to AIDS totaling 100 million by 2020. We cannot let that happen. With our partners \nworldwide, we will turn the tide against HIV/AIDS and release its stranglehold on the future.\n\n2. President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief: The Hope of a New Approach\n\nPresident Bush has responded to the challenge of global HIV/AIDS with the his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. \nThe Emergency Plan brings unprecedented resources to bear against the disease. Committing $15 billion over five \nyears, the President's initiative is the largest commitment in history by a single nation for an international health \ninitiative. The Emergency Plan makes a revolutionary commitment to providing resources for treatment for HIV-\ninfected individuals, a vital intervention that many have thought could not be offered in developing-country \nenvironments. President. Bush has asserted that \"in the face of preventable death and suffering, the United States \nhas the power and moral duty to act,\" and the Emergency Plan will focus on bringing life--extending HIV/AIDS \ntreatment to some of the most afflicted and under-resourced countries in the world.\n\nThe Emergency Plan strongly supports integrated prevention, treatment, and care with the knowledge that the \navailability of each enhances the effect of all. Prior interventions have focused on preventing HIV transmission, \ncorrectly acknowledging that the war against the disease cannot be won unless new infections are prevented. But \nprevention efforts have been hindered by the limited availability of treatment and care. Lack of treatment has \ncontributed to fear of and stigma against the disease, discouraging people from seeking testing and disclosing their \nstatus to partners, a necessary step for preventing HIV transmission.\n\nThe priorities defined above--providing treatment in some of the most afflicted nations, and integrating prevention, \ntreatment, and care--are reflected in the breakdown of the initiative's funding. The Emergency Plan targets $9 \nbillion in new funding to dramatically ramp up prevention, treatment, and care services in 15 of the most affected \ncountries of the world,   representing at least 50 percent of HIV infections worldwide. At the same time, President \nBush's Emergency Plan devotes $5 billion over five years to existing bilateral efforts to support HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria programs and research, and pledges $1 billion over five years to the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Through intensive intervention in areas with the highest concentration of disease \nand strengthened programs worldwide, the United States and its partners will defeat AIDS.\n\nThe Emergency Plan is defined by more than the unprecedented commitment of resources. Through his \nEmergency Plan, President Bush has also demanded a new way of doing business that will transform our \nHIV/AIDS activities worldwide. His Emergency Plan will demand high levels of accountability and will establish \nmeasurable goals against which progress will be tracked and evaluated, with funding decisions based on \nperformance toward these goals. Policy and program decisions will be evidence-based and results- driven. The \nEmergency Plan will be implemented under new leadership from the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, reporting \ndirectly to the Secretary of State and coordinating, in the United States and in the field, the work of all U.S. \nagencies fighting HIV/AIDS globally. With the core expertise of various U.S. agencies reoriented and redirected \n\n\n\ntoward a coordinated, focused mission to achieve measurable goals, our progress against HIV/AIDS will be greatly \namplified.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan dramatically expands upon two decades of the United States' global leadership \nin the fight against HIV/AIDS. The United States has been the primary contributor to HIV/AIDS research, \ninstrumental to the development of tools ranging from testing to treatment, as well as projects that provide hope for \nthe future, such as vaccines and micro-bicides. Under President Bush's leadership, the United States currently \nprovides over 50 percent of all bilateral funding to combat global AIDS; was a founding member of the Global \nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and is the Fund's largest donor, responsible for over 37 percent of \nall pledges to it. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is lending additional U.S. leadership and support to \nthe Fund as Chair of its Board through 2005.\n\nThrough their field presence in over 100 countries, U.S. agencies have provided essential technical assistance and \ntraining to strengthen HIV/AIDS programs worldwide. The President's International Mother and Child HIV \nPrevention Initiative, established in 2002 to reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission by 40 percent within five years \nin the Emergency Plan's 14 focus countries, has laid the groundwork for the strategies that the Emergency Plan \nwill pursue. It has also provided additional evidence and knowledge on the feasibility - and necessity - of integrated \nprevention, treatment, and care programs.\n\nFollowing President Bush's lead, we embark on this new phase of our global leadership in the fight against \nHIV/AIDS with hope and humility, knowing that our efforts must be grounded in partnership, collaboration, and \ncompassion. The world is poised to halt and reverse the devastation wrought by HIV/AIDS, with the historic \nopportunity to confront the challenges and achieve dramatic results. With a fundamental belief in the value and \ndignity of every human life, as articulated by President Bush, the United States is capitalizing on its expertise and \nthe strengths of its partnerships with host governments, multilateral institutions, nongovernmental organizations, \nand the private sector to take bold action against HIV/AIDS.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: The Integrated HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment, and Care Model]\n\nSidebar 1: The Integrated HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment, and Care Model \n\n3. Structure of the Strategic Plan\n\nCritical interventions to reach the goals of President Bush's Emergency Plan are presented in the following \nchapters. Chapter III emphasizes the need for bold leadership from all sectors, and in all nations, and describes \nstrategies the United States will pursue to bring voice and additional resources to the tight against global AIDS. \nChapters IV, V, and VI describe strategies for integrating and strengthening prevention, treatment, and care \nactivities in the focus countries. Chapter VII illustrates how the Emergency Plan will direct U.S. Government \nHIV/AIDS activities in countries beyond the focus countries where today we have existing bilateral programs. \nChapter VIII identifies methodologies for engagement with multilateral institutions and joint ventures for an amplified \nglobal HIV/AIDS response. Implementation and management strategies are presented in chapter IX. Interventions \nthat support strengthened programming and accountability in USG initiatives, including issues related to supply \nchain management and the role of research and strategic information, are presented in chapter X. Chapter XI \npresents special topics of congressional interest and other appendices.\n\nIII. ENGENDERING BOLD LEADERSHIP\n\n        \"There are only two possible responses to suffering on this\n\n        scale. We can turn our eyes away in resignation and despair or we\n\n        can take decisive, historic action to turn the tide against this\n\n        disease and give the hope of life to millions who need our help\n\n\n\n        now. The United States of America chooses the path of action and\n\n        the path of hope.\"\n\n        President George W. Bush. April 29, 2003\n\nPresident Bush's bold and aggressive attack on global HIV/AIDS has made it clear--leadership is essential to \nbattling HIV/AIDS. Early and effective action by high-level political leaders can contain and even roll back \nepidemics, as evidenced in Uganda, Thailand, and Senegal. Where leaders have been silent, inactive, or worse--\ncombative, or propagating incorrect or stigmatizing messages--HIV continues to spread despite the best efforts of \ncommunities and contributors. Leadership is an essential enabler for HIV/AIDS efforts, spurring action and \nmagnifying its effects. Heads of state wield enormous power, authority, and legitimacy. They can combat stigma, \ndenial, and misinformation through forthright discussion of the nature of the disease and thus lead citizens to \nchange their behavior. They can influence cultural patterns that contribute to the spread of disease, including \ngender inequity. By demonstrating that all sectors of society must contribute to the battle against AIDS and applying \nappropriate levels of human and financial resources to prevention, control, and treatment activities, they are \npowerful mobilizers of new partners, action, and resources. It is political leadership that ensures a multisectoral \nresponse, proven crucial to combating HIV/AIDS effectively.\n\nThe need for leadership is not limited to heads of state. At both the national and community levels, wide-ranging \nleadership is needed in civilian government, the military, medical institutions, ethnic and cultural groups, \ncorporations, labor unions, schools and universities, religious institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nand the media. Those who lead and influence people and organizations have the capacity, and the duty, to make a \ndramatic difference in stemming the spread of the epidemic and supporting the necessary treatment and care for \nthose infected and affected by AIDS.\n\nThe need for leadership is also not limited to highly impacted countries. Every country has a starting point for the \nepidemic. Early leadership can determine the difference between societies that experience low incidence of disease \nand those held hostage by raging epidemics. In many countries, low overall prevalence rates often mask firmly \nentrenched epidemics in high-risk groups, such as injection drug users, sex workers, and men who have sex with \nmen. Epidemics among these often disenfranchised communities must be addressed to conquer the disease. Too \noften, patterns of official denial and stigmatization have led to widespread epidemics.\n\nPresident Bush has called for leadership against AIDS from every nation. For those countries with the means to be \ninternational donors, national leaders are in a position to increase public and private international HIV/AIDS \nassistance. The United States is continuing to show unprecedented global leadership and commitment in funding \nthe global AIDS response. In 2002 and 2003, the U.S. Government gave international contributions greater than \nthose of all other donor governments combined. Assuming level funding by other donors, U.S. international \ncontributions in 2004 will be approximately twice those of the rest of the world's donor governments combined. \nGiven that HIV/AIDS is a crisis of unprecedented global proportions, there is a role for every leader to play in \ndefeating it.\n\nPresident Bush has stepped up to this challenge with his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. His Administration will \nuse its leadership position and influence to encourage others to demonstrate the bold leadership that is necessary \nto win the war against AIDS. Through proactive diplomacy and communication, the U.S. Government will stimulate \ngreater leadership at every level--from national statesmen to village elders--in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nLeadership Objective:\n\nEngender bold leadership and additional resources from other countries for the fight against global AIDS\n\nLeadership Strategies:\n\n1. Engaging heads of state and other government officials through bilateral diplomatic interventions and multilateral \nforums\n\n2. Reaching out to a broad range of community and religious leaders and private institutions to generate \nmultisectoral leadership and responses to HIV/AIDS\n\n\n\n3. Using the tools of public diplomacy and communications to inform and engage new partners, including media, in \nthe fight against HIV/AIDS\n\n4. Using diplomatic interventions in bilateral and multilateral forums with donor nations, and communications tools \nwith the public and private institutions, to raise additional resources for global AIDS\n\n1. Engaging head of state and other government officials through bilateral diplomatic intervention and multilateral \nforums\n\nHeads of state have a particular role to play, and particular responsibility to bear, in engendering an appropriate \nresponse to HIV/AIDS. In countries facing current or emerging epidemics, leadership from heads of state can \ngenerate early and effective action by publicly acknowledging HIV/AIDS as a problem in their country, raising and \ndevoting appropriate resources, and demanding broad involvement. In many countries, budgetary resources need \nto be focused on prevention, care, and treatment programs to stem the epidemic. The engagement of heads of \nstate contributes greatly to a coordinated response, offering such tools as national HIV/AIDS strategies and \ndedicated funding streams through which to allocate and track resource distribution.\n\nHIV/AIDS adversely affects health care systems, education in schools and universities, economic development, \nand, more broadly, peace and security. All ministries have a role to play in the fight against the pandemic. Military \nleaders and other sectoral leadership such as ministers of education and labor can strengthen the HIV/AIDS \nresponse by capitalizing on their access to specific populations that have specific needs.\n\nUnder President Bush's leadership in fighting global HIV/AIDS, the U.S. Government has an opportunity to \nencourage leadership from heads of state and other government officials. The United States will:\n\n     *  Employ diplomatic interventions by high-level officials based in\n\n        Washington and American ambassadors abroad to engage directly with\n\n        and encourage strong leadership from heads of state and\n\n        counterparts in government such as ministers of health, education,\n\n        defense, and foreign affairs;\n\n     *  Ensure that American embassy staffs abroad are informed and engaged\n\n        on the issue of HIV/AIDS as it relates to their host countries and\n\n        raise HIV/AIDS issues in host-country forums; and\n\n     *  Advocate for greater leadership through multilateral forums such as\n\n        UNAIDS, international HIV/AIDS events and conferences, and\n\n        multilateral actions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\n\n        Tuberculosis, and Malaria.\n\n2. Reaching out to a broad range of community leaders and private institutions to generate multisectoral leadership \nand responses to HIV/AIDS\n\nSome of the most intractable problems in achieving an effective HIV/AIDS response have been combating stigma, \nreaching individuals with HIV/AIDS messages to bring about behavior change, and addressing issues of culture and \ntraditional roles that contribute to increased vulnerability, especially for women and girls. HIV/AIDS messages need \nto reach people where they live, learn, work, and worship. Trusted community leaders have reach, authority, and \nlegitimacy to carry forward vital messages about HIV/AIDS and combat stigma, denial, and negative cultural \npractices. In addition, where government has not responded adequately to HIV/AIDS, bottom-up leadership can \nhelp mobilize appropriate responses, including resources, from government.\n\nThe U.S. Government will use public-private partnerships at local, national, regional, and world-wide levels to \nstrengthen global and in-country responses to HIV/AIDS. These partnerships will be fostered by the Office of the \nU.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and U.S. ambassadors in all regions. In countries where the United States has \nexisting HIV/AIDS programs (see appendix F), these efforts will be closely linked to the programs. In countries \n\n\n\nwhere the U.S. Government has HIV/AIDS activities, such as public diplomacy efforts, but no assistance programs, \nthese efforts will serve as a catalyst for action by local officials.\n\nThe United States will:\n\n     *  Engage with community leaders such as mayors, tribal authorities,\n\n        elders, and traditional healers to promote correct and consistent\n\n        information about HIV/AIDS and combat stigma and harmful cultural\n\n        practices. Even in an environment of strong government leadership\n\n        and good policy, failure to involve community leaders can undermine\n\n        efforts to implement sound policies and programs. Conversely,\n\n        community leaders can reinforce messages and engender cultural\n\n        change that is difficult to achieve via program or policy means.\n\n     *  Engage with faith-based leaders on international, national, and\n\n        local levels. Religious leaders have enormous reach and authority.\n\n        In many countries, as many as 80 percent of citizens participate\n\n        regularly in religious life, and the pulpits of religious leaders\n\n        are a powerful platform from which to promote correct and\n\n        consistent information, encourage behavior change, combat stigma,\n\n        and strengthen community responses to HIV/AIDS. The United States\n\n        will identify, train, and partner with faith-based leaders.\n\n     *  Work with national and international business coalitions and labor\n\n        organizations to facilitate their efforts to improve and greatly\n\n        expand programs in the workplace, particularly at companies in\n\n        heavily impacted countries. Through close collaboration with\n\n        business and labor, the U.S. Government will serve as a catalyst\n\n        for developing and implementing prevention, treatment, and care\n\n        programs for employees and immediate communities. The strategy will\n\n        take advantage of marketing, communications, and logistical skills\n\n        in the business sector to improve the reach and effectiveness of\n\n        AIDS programs.\n\n3. Using the tools of communications to inform and engage new partners, including media, in the fight against \nHIV/AIDS\n\nIn many countries of the world, there is great unrealized potential in using the media as a positive force for \ndiscussion of AIDS and for overcoming stigma and denial, promoting information based on best practices, and \nexpanding the reach of correct and consistent HIV/AIDS messages. The United States will:\n\n     *  Inform the public of the extent and nature of the AIDS epidemic and\n\n        the need for action through international media channels and\n\n        through print and electronic media in the 162 countries where the\n\n        United States is represented, including placement of public service\n\n\n\n        announcements on radio and television and publication of op-ed\n\n        pieces by the American ambassador and others;\n\n     *  Assist journalists in promoting responsible reporting on HIV/AIDS;\n\n        and\n\n     *  Use exchange programs to provide key people with participatory\n\n        involvement in a range of activities that serve to enhance their\n\n        skills and knowledge related to HIV/AIDS. These exchanges will be\n\n        customized for specific sub-groups of people who are in a position\n\n        to demonstrate leadership in their home countries, including health\n\n        care workers, journalists, and others.\n\n4. Using diplomatic interventions in bilateral and multilateral forums with donor nations, and communications tools \nwith the public and private institution, to raise additional resources for global AIDS\n\nWorldwide resources to combat global HIV/AIDS remain far short of what is necessary to win the war against the \ndisease. Wealthy nations, corporations such as the Coca-Cola Company, and private institutions such as the Bill & \nMelinda Gates Foundation have made vital contributions to the fight against HIV/AIDS, and the U.S. Government \nwill continue to seek their partnership and support. Under President Bush's lead, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator \nwill work with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and others in this high-level \neffort to generate greater bilateral and multilateral contributions from donor governments and private institutions. In \naddition, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will use public communications tools to inform and engage \ncitizens worldwide in the battle against HIV/AIDS and develop a constituency that will ensure a long-term global \nresponse.\n\nIV. CRITICAL INTERVENTIONS IN THE FOCUS COUNTRIES: Prevention\n\n        \"We will train doctors and nurses and other health care\n\n        professional so they can treat HIV/AIDS patients. Our efforts will\n\n        ensure that clinics and laboratories will be built or renovated and\n\n        then equipped. Child care workers will be hired and trained to care\n\n        for AIDS orphans, and people living with AIDS will get home-based\n\n        care to ease their suffering...And we're developing a system to\n\n        monitor and evaluate this entire program, so we can be sure we're\n\n        getting the job done.\"\n\n        President George W. Bush, July 2,2003\n\nThe 2003 UNAIDS AIDS Epidemic Update offered a set of stunning statistics--last year, 3 million people died of \nAIDS. At the same time, 5 million more were infected with HIV. Despite two decades of focused attention on \nprevention, we have yet to achieve widespread success, as evidenced by the 14,000 people who each day join the \nranks of those infected. Clearly, HIV/AIDS cannot be defeated unless the number of new infections is dramatically \nreduced and eventually eliminated.\n\nIt is time, however for new thinking and approaches. Past and current prevention messages have often failed to \nachieve the widespread behavior change that is necessary to end the pandemic. Prevention efforts are further \nhampered by the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and gender inequality that increases the vulnerability of women and \ngirls.\n\n\n\nOf the approximately 40 million people infected with HIV worldwide, it is estimated that as many as 95 percent do \nnot know their status. Without knowledge of their status, people continue to spread the disease unwittingly and do \nnot seek treatment. Given the sheer numbers of people who do not know their status, this factor alone represents \nan enormous challenge to turning the tide against HIV/AIDS. Limited testing strategies, insufficient testing services, \nand a lack of enabling policies have thus tar proven inadequate for making sufficient progress against the disease.\n\nOverstressed and poorly functioning health care systems also contribute to the spread of disease. Medical \ntransmission of HIV continues to be a problem, spread through unsafe injections, unnecessary medical procedures, \nand use of unscreened blood supplies. Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain high, and, when \nuntreated, contribute to the spread of HIV. Health care systems, understaffed and inadequately supplied, have been \nunable to close this entry point for HIV infection.\n\nIn 2001, an estimated 720,000 children globally were infected via mother-to-child HIV transmission. U.S. \nGovernment programs such as the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, as well as \nthose implemented by other partners, have proven that the administration of a short course of antiretroviral (ARV) \ndrugs and improved breastfeeding practices can dramatically reduce the number of mother-to-child infections and \nthus the number of new infections overall. Such programs also provide a critical link to HIV/AIDS treatment \nprograms that offer ARV and other treatment to HIV-infected women and their families, thus helping to preserve the \nfamily unit.\n\nFinally, the limited availability of treatment and care, and its effects of extinguishing hope and fueling tear and \nstigma, presents its own barriers to prevention efforts, as denial continues to bolster inaction.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan is specifically designed to address these challenges and capitalize on the \nopportunities outlined above in achieving its goal of preventing 7 million new HIV infections. In its use of evidence-\nbased prevention programs such as the \"ABC\"--Abstinence, Be faithful, and as appropriate, correct and consistent \nuse of Condoms--approach, proven successful in Uganda, Zambia, Senegal, and elsewhere, the Emergency Plan \nwill target prevention funds to methodologies that are effective in helping people avoid behaviors that place them \nat risk of contracting HIV. Identified best practices such as increased testing; appropriately tailored interventions for \nspecific populations including women, men, and high-risk groups; the involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS, \nparents, and leaders from all sectors of society; and stigma reduction will be aggressively promoted to achieve real \nresults in reducing the number of new infections. At the same time, these interventions must strengthen existing \nindigenous responses to the epidemic, be discerning and responsive to the culture, and build on community \nstructures that influence social and community norms in order to reduce risk behaviors.\n\nFurthermore, in keeping with the Emergency Plan's health care approach, specific interventions to strengthen \nhealth care services to reduce HIV transmission are another cornerstone of prevention activities. The President's \nEmergency Plan will help build the health infrastructure necessary to strengthen infection control programs, \nreduce medical transmission of HIV, and build the capacity of health care workers to treat STIs and prevent mother-\nto-child infection. Last, the fundamental principle of the President's Emergency Plan--to integrate prevention, \ntreatment, and care--is intended to stimulate a cycle that will reduce stigma and fear, create incentives for testing, \nand thus amplify prevention efforts.\n\nPrevention Objective:\n\nPrevent 7 million HIV infections in the focus countries\n\nPrevention Strategies:\n\n1. Rapidly scale up existing prevention services\n\n2. Build capacity for effective long-term prevention programs\n\n3. Advance policy initiatives that support prevention of HIV infection\n\n4. Collect strategic information to monitor and evaluate progress and ensure compliance with Emergency Plan \npolicies and strategies\n\n1. Rapidly scale up existing prevention services\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that immediate action to implement comprehensive prevention programs could avert 60 percent of \nnew HIV infections in resource-limited settings by 2010. A delay of only three years could reduce efficacy by nearly \n50 percent. Thus, rapid scale-up of existing prevention services is an urgent priority of President Bush's \nEmergency Plan. Much has been learned about effective strategies for prevention over the past two decades. \nWhile the President's Emergency Plan seeks in the long term to develop sustainable national programs in each \ncountry, in the short term it will move quickly through the expansion of current activities. Faith-based and \ncommunity-based groups, as well as many ministries of health, have established excellent prevention programs in \nthe areas of abstinence promotion, behavior change, prevention of HIV infection from mother to child, and technical \nassistance for improved medical practices. These organizations offer innovative, effective, and accountable local \nprograms, and have established relationships with national organizations and local communities. Such \norganizations provide the optimal foundation to build on best practices toward the development of comprehensive \nnational prevention programs.\n\nOrganizations are poised to rapidly and accountably scale up programs in the following priority areas:\n\n     *  Prevention of HIV infection through abstinence and behavior change\n\n        for youth;\n\n     *  Prevention of HIV infection through HIV testing, targeted outreach,\n\n        and condom distribution to high-risk populations;\n\n     *  Prevention of HIV infection from mother to child; and\n\n     *  Prevention of HIV infection through safe blood, improved medical\n\n        practices, and post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nPrevention of HIV infection through abstinence and behavior change for youth\n\nIn many of the countries hardest hit by HIV/AIDS, sexual activity begins early and prior to marriage. Surveys show \nthat, on average, slightly more than 40 percent of women in sub-Saharan Africa have had premarital sex before age \n20; among young men, sex before marriage is even more common. Moreover, a significant minority of youth \nexperience first sex before age 15. Abstinence until marriage programs are particularly important for young people, \nas fully half of all new infections occur in the 15- to 24-year-old age group. Delaying first sexual intercourse by even \na year can have significant impact on the health and well-being of adolescents and on the progress of the epidemic \nin communities.\n\nAdolescent girls in high HIV-prevalence countries in Africa are at significantly higher risk of acquiring HIV. In some \ncommunities, as many as 20 percent of girls aged 15 to 19 are infected compared to 5 percent of boys the same \nage. These age differentials in HIV prevalence reflect a pattern of older men having sex with younger women. \nYoung women involved in exchange relationships with older men are disadvantaged by gender, age, and economic \npower. Moreover, a substantial proportion of girls in Africa and the Caribbean experience coerced sex, including \nforced first sex.\n\nYouth are subject to a variety of conflicting social messages and influences related to sex. Although many \ntraditional social norms emphasize abstinence for youth, extramarital sexual activity is common among adults, \nespecially men. While virginity is emphasized for girls, sexual activity is often seen as a sign of manhood for young \nmen. Parents, religious leaders, teachers, and the media may each provide different information related to \nHIV/AIDS, adding to confusion in decision-making.\n\nComprehensive and effective prevention approaches reflect the complex influences on young people's decision-\nmaking and the need to address the broader social factors that shape their behaviors. Internationally, a number of \nprograms have proven successful in increasing abstinence until marriage, delaying first sex, reducing the number of \npartners, and even achieving \"secondary abstinence\" among sexually experienced youth.\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan recognizes the diversity of countries and the need to harmonize prevention \nmessages at the community level. Correct and consistent information is vital to effective HIV prevention, and \nprogram partners thus should not disseminate incorrect information about any health intervention or device. In \n\n\n\naddition, national governments may appropriately seek to coordinate information or referral links to other services \ndesigned for high-risk populations.\n\nThe Emergency Plan supports the following categories of activities as part of its rapid scale-up of prevention \nprograms for youth:\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Risk Elimination, Risk Reduction]\n\nSidebar 2: Risk Elimination, Risk Reduction \n\nScale up skill-based HIV education, especially for younger youth and girls. Young people need to be reached early, \nbefore they begin having sex, with skills-based HIV education that provides focused messages about the benefits of \nabstinence until marriage and other safe behaviors. Activities should help young people develop the self-esteem to \ndelay sex until marriage, make informed choices, and develop the communication skills to say \"no\" to sex (as well \nas to alcohol and drugs, which increase vulnerability to sexual pressure). Best practices suggest that \ncommunication skills and the ability to personalize risk can be achieved through curricula that use interactive \nmethods to target specific risk factors for early sexual activity in the local context and help young people define \nvalues. Ideally, programs should go beyond sexuality to build on young people's assets and encourage them to stay \nin school and plan for their futures. While these programs are most relevant to younger adolescents aged 10 to 14 \nyears, especially girls, they are also appropriate for older adolescents. Suggested activities include:\n\n     *  Developing and disseminating age-appropriate curricula that include\n\n        clear messages about abstinence until marriage and other safe\n\n        behaviors, and that address risk factors in the local context;\n\n     *  Expanding skills-based HIV education through schools, working both\n\n        at the national level with ministries of education and local\n\n        schools at the community level;\n\n     *  Strengthening HIV education delivered through after-school programs\n\n        run by youth services networks, including faith-based networks; and\n\n     *  Strengthening programs in HIV education for children who are not in\n\n        school.\n\nPromote healthy norms and behaviors. Communities need to mobilize to address the norms, attitudes, values, and \nbehaviors that increase vulnerability to HIV, including multiple casual sex partners and cross-generational and \ntransactional sex. To stimulate such mobilization, there is an urgent need to help communities identify and \nrecognize the ways in which they contribute to establishing and reinforcing norms that may contribute to youth risk, \nvulnerability, and stigma. President Bush's Emergency Plan will support groups that discourage harmful norms \nthrough a variety of media and other activities at both the community and national levels. Suggested activities \ninclude:\n\n     *  Training local religious and other traditional leaders in HIV\n\n        concerns and supporting them in publicizing the risks of early\n\n        sexual activity, multiple partners, and cross-generational sex;\n\n     *  Supporting youth-led community media to help youth, their parents,\n\n        and the broader community personalize the risks involved in these\n\n        behaviors; and\n\n     *  Supporting media campaigns that reinforce and make abstinence until\n\n        marriage, fidelity, partner reduction, and other safer behaviors\n\n\n\n        legitimate options and standards of behavior for both youth and\n\n        adults.\n\nReinforce the role of parents and other protective factors. Parents are potentially the most powerful protective \nfactors in young people's lives; they have great potential to guide youth toward healthy and responsible decision-\nmaking and safer behaviors. In Emergency Plan countries, where many youth have lost their parents to AIDS, \nother adult caregivers and mentors also have an important role to play in providing guidance to youth. Many adults, \nhowever, find it difficult to communicate with teens, both on broader issues of regulation and discipline and in \ndiscussing sexuality and their own expectations and values about sex. The Emergency Plan will support efforts to \nreach out to parents and other adult caregivers to educate and involve them in issues relating to youth and HIV and \nto empower them by improving their communication skills in the areas of sexuality as well as broader limit-setting \nand mentoring. Suggested activities include:\n\n     *  Holding parenting education workshops to improve parent-child\n\n        communication on HIV, sexuality, and broader issues such as\n\n        limit-setting, through parent-teacher associations, local social\n\n        and civic clubs, and faith-based groups;\n\n     *  Organizing special school and community events jointly for parents\n\n        and teens to promote mutual communication about HIV and healthy\n\n        behaviors; and\n\n     *  Developing and training a cadre of volunteer mentors for youth who\n\n        lack sufficient parental or other adult supervision, including\n\n        training in messages for HIV prevention.\n\nAddress sexual coercion and exploitation of young people. Adolescents need a safe environment where they can \ngrow and develop without fear of forced or unwanted sex, which often precludes the option of abstinence. The \nEmergency Plan supports psychosocial and other assistance for victims of sexual abuse. Efforts to target men with \nmessages that challenge norms about masculinity and that emphasize the need to stop sexual violence and \ncoercion will also be important. Suggested activities include:\n\n     *  Organizing campaigns and events to educate local communities about\n\n        sexual violence against youth and strengthen community sanctions\n\n        against such behaviors;\n\n     *  Implementing workplace programs for older men and school-based\n\n        programs for young boys to provide education about preventing\n\n        sexual violence, with a special focus on men who have a higher\n\n        propensity to become perpetrators;\n\n     *  Training health care providers, teachers, and peer educators to\n\n        identify, counsel, and refer young victims of sexual abuse for\n\n        other health services; and\n\n     *  Working with governments and NGOs to eliminate gender inequalities\n\n        in the civil and criminal code.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Violence Against Women and HIV/AIDS]\n\n\n\nSidebar 3: Violence Against Women and HIV/AIDS \n\nPrevention of HIV infection through HIV testing, targeted outreach, and condom distribution to high-risk populations\n\nFollowing the \"ABC\" model, and recognizing that condoms are an essential means of HIV prevention for \npopulations who engage in risky behavior, rapid scale-up of activities that target specific at-risk populations with \noutreach, prevention messages, testing, and condoms will be undertaken. These groups include prostitutes, \nsexually active discordant couples, substance abusers, and others. In doing this, care will be taken to adhere to \nlocal guidelines and standards and to ensure that the key behavioral messages of abstinence, faithfulness, and \npartner reduction are not confounded.\n\nPrevention of HIV infection from mother to child\n\nThe technology now exists to substantially reduce mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) using simplified \ninterventions that international clinical trials have demonstrated can reduce risk of HIV transmission from mother to \nchild by 30 to 50 percent. The interventions involve providing routine HIV testing for pregnant women, administering \nshort-course ARV prophylaxis to HIV-infected mothers in the last weeks of pregnancy or during labor or delivery, \nand administering ARV drugs by droplet to infants within 72 hours of birth. The interventions also call for less \ninvasive medical procedures during childbirth, improved breastfeeding practices, and prevention and treatment of \nmalaria.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan will build on the significant work already accomplished under the President's \n2002 International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative (now integrated into the Emergency Plan). President \nBush's Emergency Plan will support rapid expansion of these programs through the following suggested activities:\n\n     *  Scaling up existing prevention of mother-to-child transmission\n\n        (PMTCT) programs by rapidly mobilizing resources;\n\n     *  Providing technical assistance and expanded training for health\n\n        care providers (including family planning providers, traditional\n\n        birth attendants, and others) on appropriate antenatal care, safe\n\n        labor and delivery practices, breastfeeding, malaria prevention and\n\n        treatment, and family planning;\n\n     *  Strengthening the referral links among health care providers;\n\n     *  Ensuring effective supply chain management of the range of\n\n        PMTCT-related products and equipment; and\n\n     *  Expanding PMTCT programs to include HIV treatment for HIV-infected\n\n        mothers and other members of the child's immediate family.\n\nPrevention of HIV infection through safe blood, improved medical practices, and post-exposure prophylaxis\n\nHIV transmission in medical settings, including through blood transfusions, is a significant contributor to the HIV \npandemic. Thus, the rapid implementation of safe blood programs and precautions against medical transmission of \nHIV is a priority area for the President's Emergency Plan. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 5 \nto 10 percent of all HIV transmissions are attributable to unsafe blood transfusions. Transmission of HIV and other \nbloodborne pathogens via blood transfusion is preventable by establishing an adequate supply of safe blood \nthrough a systematized blood transfusion service and by minimizing unnecessary transfusions. According to WHO, \nhowever, in 2002 only 90 percent of blood donations in Africa were screened for HIV, only 40 percent for hepatitis \nC, and 55 percent for hepatitis B.\n\nMuch can be done to reduce the likelihood of transmission, improve infection control, and increase the quality of \nhealth care services overall. President Bush's Emergency Plan will provide technical assistance and training to \n\n\n\nprevent medical transmission of HIV and improve the quality of services through the network model. Support will be \nprovided to improve blood safety, increase the use of safe injection practices, ensure the practice of universal \nprecautions, and increase the availability of post-exposure prophylaxis. Specifically, expert guidance, support, and \nassistance from organizations currently providing training and technical assistance will be provided to ministries of \nhealth and national transfusion services to develop and implement comprehensive national safe blood programs. \nSuggested activities include:\n\n     *  Providing technical assistance for developing effective national,\n\n        generic, and site-specific policies, protocols, guidelines, and\n\n        practices related to blood donation; safe injections; obtaining,\n\n        handling, storing, testing, transporting, distributing, and\n\n        disposing of blood, sharps, other injection equipment, and medical\n\n        wastes; and universal precautions for infection control and\n\n        prevention and management of occupational exposure to HIV;\n\n     *  Training health care staff in the use of protocols and\n\n        guidelines--the Emergency Plan will support training, supervision,\n\n        and other performance improvement measures for health care\n\n        professionals in the areas listed above as well as education about\n\n        alternatives to injection in primary care practice;\n\n     *  Ensuring effective supply chain management of the range of products\n\n        and equipment needed to prevent medical transmission of HIV; and\n\n     *  Providing technical assistance, training, and products for\n\n        post-exposure prophylaxis in health care settings and for other\n\n        types of potential exposure (such as sexual violence) once\n\n        protocols have been established and trained personnel and supplies\n\n        are in place.\n\n2. Build capacity for effective long-term prevention programs\n\nAt the same time that President Bush's Emergency Plan is mobilizing the rapid scale-up of behavior change \ninterventions and other prevention services, it will also be laying the foundation for sustainable and effective long-\nterm local and national prevention programs. The President's initiative will help build, strengthen, and improve the \nquality and sustainability of prevention programs by promoting evidence-based best practices, encouraging \ninnovation and evaluation to identify effective new approaches, and improving program planning, implementation, \nmanagement, and monitoring. The development of such comprehensive and sustainable programming will be \naccomplished through the following key operational strategies:\n\n     *  Promoting the \"ABC\" model;\n\n     *  Innovatively expanding HIV testing;\n\n     *  Supporting interventions for those at high risk of infection;\n\n     *  Reaching and engaging mobile male populations;\n\n     *  Improving diagnosis and treatment of STIs; and\n\n     *  Developing and strengthening institutional capacity of implementing\n\n        organizations.\n\n\n\nPromoting the \"ABC\" model\n\nEvidence from Uganda, Senegal, and Zambia demonstrates the effectiveness of a balanced approach to behavior \nchange that encourages the adoption of \"ABC\" behaviors--A for abstinence, B for being faithful, and C for correct \nand consistent use of condoms as appropriate.\n\nThe application of A, B, and C interventions will be balanced and targeted according to the needs and specific \ncircumstances of different at-risk populations. Expanding the human resources necessary to implement this bold \nnew prevention strategy will require engaging a wide range of partners, from women's associations to faith-based \norganizations (FBOs), sports clubs to workplaces, parents to schools, and health workers to traditional healers. \nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will support efforts to build the capacity of local and national partners to \nstrengthen ABC prevention messages and link them in their application to ongoing treatment and care programs.\n\nThe application of the ABC model will emphasize:\n\nAbstinence for youth. The strategies for youth described in detail above encourage abstinence until marriage for \nthose who have not yet initiated sexual activity and \"secondary abstinence\" for unmarried youth who have already \nengaged in intercourse. FBOs are in a strong position to help young people see the benefits of abstinence until \nmarriage and support them in choosing to postpone sexual activity. Programs will help youth develop the \nknowledge, confidence, and communication skills necessary to make informed choices and avoid risky behavior. \nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will also support programs that reinforce parental involvement, as parents are \nthe primary caregivers and have the responsibility of overseeing the upbringing of their children.\n\nBeing faithful. Some of the most significant results from Uganda resulted from changes in behavior related to fidelity \nin marriage, monogamous relationships, and reducing the number of sexual partners among sexually active \nunmarried persons. President Bush's Emergency Plan will build on this success by supporting counseling, peer \neducation, and community-based interventions to address social norms that increase vulnerability to HIV, such as \nthe acceptance of men having multiple sexual partners outside of marriage, cross-generational sex, and \ntransactional sex. Working through the media and community-based and faith-based institutions, interventions will \ndeliver messages that promote abstinence until marriage and fidelity to one partner, encourage men to refrain from \nsexual promiscuity and to respect women, and encourage testing. Knowledge of HIV serostatus is especially \nimportant, and counseling and HIV testing of couples can be an effective strategy. Despite the tact that sero-\ndiscordant couples--couples in which one partner is HIV-positive and the other HIV-negative--may remain \nmonogamous, the risk still remains high for the uninfected partner.\n\nCorrect and consistent use of condoms as appropriate. For those who are infected or who are unable to avoid high-\nrisk behaviors (such as discordant couples), condom use is a critical risk-reduction intervention. The Emergency \nPlan will make condoms available to reduce the risk of the spread of HIV infection among those who engage in \nhigh-risk activity by strengthening public and private sector programs to create demand among those at high risk \nand by expanding the number of condom distribution outlets near areas where high-risk behavior takes place. \nImproved condom forecasting and supply chain management will be necessary to ensure condoms are available in \nthese high-risk settings. Use of condoms will also be promoted for sexually active discordant couples. In doing this, \nevery effort will be made to deliver a consistent \"ABC\" message so that the general population receives a clear \nmessage that the best means of preventing HIV/AIDS is to avoid risk all together.\n\nInnovatively expanding HIV testing\n\nEstimates indicate that at many as 95 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS do not know their status. Without \nknowing their status, individuals can neither access appropriate care service for themselves nor take steps to \nprevent transmission to others. HIV testing is a critical intervention that serves as a linchpin connecting prevention \nto care and treatment. When combined with counseling, testing can also be a powerful means of educating \nindividuals and communities about HIV and preventing infection. Those who know their HIV-negative status can \navoid future infection and be linked to community prevention activities. Those who know their HIV-positive status \ncan live positively and start early prevention and treatment of opportunistic infection or STIs, begin antiretroviral \ntherapy (ART), seek psychosocial support, and plan for their futures. A strong testing and counseling program helps \nto reduce stigma and enhance the development of care and support services. In addition, HIV testing programs that \ntarget couples can identify sero-discordant couples and create a critical opportunity for prevention interventions.\n\n\n\nWhile it is anticipated that the hope generated by access to ART will increase demand for HIV testing, this is not \nsufficient. Innovative solutions must be found to dramatically increase the number of individuals who are tested and \nknow their status. The Emergency Plan will increase the availability of HIV testing services through a number of \nkey innovative strategies:\n\n     *  Integrating testing with other health services, such as family\n\n        planning, antenatal care, STI, tuberculosis, and malaria programs,\n\n        and improving the referral links among all of these services;\n\n     *  Expanding the range of settings in which confidential testing and\n\n        counseling are offered, including at times of employment, school\n\n        enrollment, military enlistment, and marriage registration, and\n\n        ensuring that non-discrimination policies and practices are in\n\n        place;\n\n     *  Strengthening training of health workers, professional and lay\n\n        counselors, laboratory technicians, and other support people\n\n        necessary to rapidly expand services;\n\n     *  Strengthening linkages between testing and counseling and post-test\n\n        services;\n\n     *  Focusing efforts to make HIV testing available to those at highest\n\n        risk of infection;\n\n     *  Strengthening of counseling and support to clients to encourage\n\n        disclosure of status to others;\n\n     *  Ensuring adequate supplies of HIV test kits and other essential\n\n        products;\n\n     *  Stimulating demand for services through innovative communications\n\n        and social marketing approaches at the community and mass media\n\n        levels;\n\n     *  Providing support to women to mitigate potential violence or other\n\n        negative outcomes of disclosing HIV-positive status to male\n\n        partners; and\n\n     *  Strengthening national guidelines for HIV testing and counseling,\n\n        where appropriate; encouraging the adoption of routine testing\n\n        policies; and ensuring regulatory support for maintaining\n\n        confidentiality, service quality, and adequate procurement and\n\n        supply chain management.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Reducing Stigma and Denial]\n\nSidebar 4: \n\n\n\nReducing Stigma and Denial\n\nSupporting interventions for those at high risk of infection\n\nSome of the populations most affected by HIV/AIDS are also the most difficult to reach through conventional health \ncare programs. Prostitutes and their clients, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users are among those \nwho are most marginalized in society and have the least access to basic health care. Developing and implementing \ninterventions with some of these groups is even more difficult because of stigma and discrimination. At the same \ntime, these populations are generally at higher risk of infection and in greatest need of prevention services. First \nand foremost, the Emergency Plan will support, approaches directed at ending risky behavior. In addition, the \nEmergency Plan supports effective new approaches to reach groups at high risk through a combination of:\n\n     *  Interpersonal approaches to behavior change, such as counseling,\n\n        mentoring, and peer outreach;\n\n     *  Community and workplace interventions to eliminate or reduce risky\n\n        behaviors;\n\n     *  Initiatives to promote the use of testing and counseling services;\n\n     *  Linkages through referral networks with other health services;\n\n     *  Diagnosis and treatment of STIs;\n\n     *  Promotion of condom use during high-risk sexual activity;\n\n     *  Strengthened referral systems to link substance abuse treatment\n\n        services with HIV testing and counseling;\n\n     *  Promotion of substance abuse prevention and treatment services; and\n\n     *  Mass media interventions with specially tailored messages.\n\nReaching and engaging mobile male populations\n\nWorkers engage in risky behavior, such as sexual relations with non-regular partners, more often when they are \nposted away from home or are required to travel for extended periods of time. Migrant workers, truck drivers, and \nmembers of uniformed services such as the armed forces and police face serious risks of HIV and other STIs and \ncan serve as a bridge for transmitting infection to the general population. The uniformed services present unique \nchallenges and opportunities for HIV prevention. The United States has played a leadership role in pioneering \nprevention approaches with the military. President Bush's Emergency Plan will build on already initiated U.S. \nGovernment activities to reach the military and other uniformed services including:\n\n     *  Peer education, interpersonal and group communication strategies,\n\n        and local mass media to promote faithfulness, partner reduction,\n\n        avoidance of commercial sex, and condom use during high-risk sexual\n\n        behavior;\n\n     *  STI and HIV testing and counseling services, linked to treatment\n\n        and care;\n\n     *  Basic workplace and in-service training on HIV/AIDS for employees,\n\n        new recruits, and existing personnel; and\n\n     *  Condom promotion and distribution for those who practice high-risk\n\n        sexual behavior.\n\n\n\nImproving diagnosis and treatment of STIs\n\nAn important link exists between STIs and the sexual transmission of HIV. Untreated, STIs can significantly \nincrease the likelihood of both acquiring and transmitting HIV. President Bush's Emergency Plan will support STI \nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment services, and the linking of these services through referral networks with HIV \ntesting and counseling and other HIV services, through implementation of the following strategies:\n\n     *  Increasing availability and accessibility of STI treatment services\n\n        through the expansion of STI prevention and treatment services\n\n        where appropriate;\n\n     *  Integrating STI treatment services with other HIV/AIDS and\n\n        reproductive health care services and improving the referral links\n\n        between programs; and\n\n     *  Improving national STI treatment protocols, training health workers\n\n        in their use, and where needed, developing national evidence-based\n\n        guidelines, protocols, and training curricula.\n\nDeveloping and strengthening institutional capacity\n\nPrevention programs are only as strong as the institutions that support them. Therefore, a strong organizational \ninfrastructure is the foundation upon which the planning, implementation, and evaluation of effective behavior \nchange interventions and prevention services are built. Many of the organizations that implement risk elimination \nand reduction interventions may need to enhance of develop the institutional capacity to support the rapid scale-up \nof prevention programs necessary to effectively address the epidemic.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan will invest in strengthening the institutional capability of implementing \norganizations by providing technical assistance, training, and funding to improve and expand the organizational \ncapability of key partners--including FBOs, other community-based organizations (CBOs), and nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs)--as well as public and private facilities that deliver abstinence-until-marriage programs, HIV \ntesting and counseling, and PMTCT and STI services. By looking at the institutional capacity building needs of \npartners within a network, and the linkages between them, support will be provided to:\n\n     *  Equip health facilities and mobile units to provide testing and\n\n        counseling and STI services;\n\n     *  Strengthen public and private sector capabilities to design and\n\n        produce behavior change materials;\n\n     *  Upgrade routine health information systems to improve prevention\n\n        services data management;\n\n     *  Strengthen qualitative and quantitative research capability;\n\n     *  Support effective product procurement, storage, and distribution,\n\n        particularly for HIV testing and targeted condom distribution\n\n        programs;\n\n     *  Strengthen NGO/CBO financial and administrative systems; and\n\n     *  Improve laboratory capacity to perform HIV testing.\n\n3. Advance policy initiatives that support prevention of HIV infection\n\n\n\nMany of the focus countries have elevated HIV/AIDS to national priority status. All promote a comprehensive \napproach integrating prevention, treatment, and care. Most have clear statements supporting the human rights of \npeople living with HIV/AIDS and condemning stigma and discrimination related to HIV status. Several explicitly \nstate the importance of greater involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS in program planning and policy. In an \neffort to address underlying factors that promote vulnerability to HIV, most of the focus countries have established \npolicies to promote gender equality, improve women's socioeconomic status, and address violence against women. \nApplication of these policies is far from complete, however, especially at the community level.\n\nA key priority of President Bush's Emergency Plan will be to support implementation of good policies and effective \nlegislation, particularly at the community level. Illustrative examples of policy issues that may be addressed through \nEmergency Plan technical assistance include:\n\n     *  Protection against stigma and discrimination, particularly within\n\n        key settings such as workplaces, schools, and the military;\n\n     *  Use of routine testing while applying the principles of\n\n        confidentiality;\n\n     *  Human resources policies, including the broadening of\n\n        responsibility for HIV testing and counseling to lower levels of\n\n        care;\n\n     *  Access to health information and care, including for traditionally\n\n        underserved populations such as women, the poor, and the disabled;\n\n     *  Polices to promote gender equality;\n\n     *  Support for the review, revision, and enforcement of laws relating\n\n        to sexual violence against minors, including strategies to more\n\n        effectively protect young victims and punish perpetrators; and\n\n     *  Programs that support abstinence until marriage and fidelity within\n\n        marriage.\n\n4. Collect strategic information to monitor and evaluate progress and ensure compliance with Emergency Plan \npolicies and strategies\n\nMeasuring prevention activities and providing useful feedback to programs for accountability and quality \nimprovement is a goal of strategic information for improved HIV prevention activities. Improved HIV sentinel clinical \nand population-based surveillance systems will measure the impact and outcomes of prevention programs. \nProgram monitoring will enable the tracking of training, media, and community outreach activities, including \ninterventions to promote abstinence. Targeted program evaluations will provide evidence-based information to \nimprove prevention programs, and information management systems will facilitate data storage and data flow. Sets \nof internationally agreed upon prevention indicators developed by WHO, UNAIDS, and U.S. Government agencies \nwill guide the Emergency Plan's strategic information system.\n\nThe prevention goal of 7 million HIV infections averted over five years will, by necessity, be based on mathematical \nprojections. A methodology will be established that will use estimates of new infections based on assumptions of \nrates that would occur without the Emergency Plan, estimates of numbers of new infections under the new \nprogram, measures of program intensity (such as numbers of persons receiving prevention services, numbers of \nworkers trained, and numbers of programs supported), and expected levels of program effectiveness.\n\nV. CRITICAL INTERVENTIONS IN THE FOCUS COUNTRIES: Treatment\n\n        \"There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of\n\n\n\n        the adult population carries the infection. More than 4 million\n\n        require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only\n\n        50,000 AIDS victims--only 50,000--are receiving the medicine they\n\n        need.\"\n\n        President George W, Bush , January 28, 2003\n\nIn 2003 alone, AIDS claimed a staggering 3 million lives. The vast majority of these deaths--2.4 million--occurred in \ndeveloping nations. Access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and improved treatment of opportunistic infections have \ndramatically reduced AIDS morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world. But in developing countries, fewer \nthan 8 percent of the 6 million people in immediate need of treatment receive it.\n\nThe United States has been a global leader in developing the tools--including ART and other treatment \nmethodologies--that have enabled people in industrialized nations to live long and productive lives despite HIV. \nDriven by the President's fundamental belief in the value and dignity of every human life, President Bush's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief expands this leadership role to dramatically increase access to treatment in some \nof the most affected and underserved countries in the world.\n\nIn the past, the provision of treatment in the developing world was considered too costly for under-resourced \nnations and too complicated for developing-country health infrastructures. These concerns are real but can no \nlonger be barriers to providing treatment to the millions who need it. President Bush believes that moral duty alone \nis sufficient reason to act quickly to save lives. Providing treatment may be our best hope against the disease and \nits consequences.\n\nIn the absence of treatment, HIV is viewed as a death sentence. With no hope of survival, many refuse to be tested \nand thus lack information they need to protect themselves and others. Lack of hope contributes to fear of the \ndisease and stigmatization of those who live with it, further hindering testing efforts. In contrast, the availability of \ntreatment demystifies, and thus destigmatizes, AIDS and people who have it. The availability of treatment also \nprovides an incentive to get tested. Treatment, then, can provide links to prevention efforts.\n\nIn addition, treatment provides a means to address the devastating consequences of AIDS-related mortality. It is \nthe human toll of the disease that contributes to the loss of productivity, the dramatically increased poverty, the \nstaggering numbers of orphans, and the population distortions that threaten not only the present but also the future. \nTreatment, in its basic ability to prolong life and reduce morbidity, allows parents to continue parenting, teachers to \ncontinue teaching, and civil servants, including health care workers, to continue serving their nations and fellow \ncitizens for years to come. The hope for a future again appears on the horizon.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan establishes the aggressive goal of providing treatment over the next five years to \nat least 2 million people living with HIV/AIDS in countries bearing some of the greatest burdens of disease. Not \neveryone infected by HIV needs immediate ART, which starts when a person begins to experience symptoms or \nwhen their immune system has deteriorated. Once ART has begun, it continues for life.\n\nMeeting this goal requires far more than providing a consistent supply of essential drugs, although this is a daunting \nchallenge in itself. It. requires addressing complex issues such as the lack of adequate infrastructure, staff, and \ntechnical capacity to provide sate, high-quality treatment programs that reach even rural communities. Further, \nmany countries have yet to develop appropriate treatment protocols and policies to ensure safe and adequate drug \nsupply and the equitable distribution of health resources. Other issues, such as drug resistance and patient \nadherence, are essential challenges that must be addressed.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan will capitalize on decades of U.S. Government expertise in biomedical research, \ndelivery of HIV/AIDS care and treatment, and development to address these challenges and rapidly expand ARV \ntreatment availability while building national and local health care capacity to sustain treatment programs over the \nlong term. Reduced drug prices, proven treatment methodologies, committed host governments, and the \ninvolvement of FBOs, CBOs, and other private sector partners have proven that it is possible to deliver this life-\nextending intervention in resource-poor settings.\n\n\n\nPriorities for the distribution of resources for treatment will ultimately be based upon the strategies, needs, and \nexisting resources of the host countries. Activities funded under the Emergency Plan will collaborate closely with \nother donors to ensure complementary treatment efforts and the best use of treatment dollars.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan is fundamentally oriented to removing barriers to treatment and working to ensure \nthat geography, gender, ethnicity, risk factors, and income no longer determine who lives and dies with AIDS. With \nthe knowledge that 8,000 lives are lost daily to AIDS, there is no time to waste.\n\nTreatment Objective:\n\nProvide treatment to at least 2 million HIV-infected individuals in the focus countries\n\nTreatment Strategies:\n\n1. Rapidly scale up treatment availability through the network model\n\n2. Build capacity for long-term sustainability of quality HIV/AIDS treatment programs\n\n3. Advance policy initiatives that support treatment\n\n4. Collect strategic information to monitor and evaluate progress and ensure compliance with Emergency Plan and \nnational policies and strategies\n\n1. Rapidly scale up treatment availability through the network model\n\nThe expansion of treatment services in the focus countries at the scale and scope envisioned by President Bush's \nEmergency Plan is unprecedented. Pioneering new approaches are required to achieve the Emergency Plan's \nambitious treatment goal. Four operational strategies will guide the rapid scale-up of treatment availability:\n\n     *  Assessing network capacity for treatment expansion;\n\n     *  Building on established clinical programs;\n\n     *  Rapidly training and mobilizing health care personnel to provide\n\n        treatment services; and\n\n     *  Enhancing the capacity of supply chain management systems to\n\n        respond to rapid treatment scale-up.\n\nAssessing network capacity for treatment expansion\n\nThe Emergency Plan will move quickly within each of the focus countries to help the host government and other \nin-country stakeholders assess the current capacity of the HIV/AIDS network by identifying key facilities, \norganizations, and health providers who deliver treatment at each level of the system. Using existing data to the \ngreatest degree possible, the rapid assessment will document:\n\n     *  Current capacity (human resources, infrastructure) of key units\n\n        within the network to deliver and rapidly expand treatment and\n\n        related services, including public facilities, private NGOs, FBOs,\n\n        and private commercial facilities;\n\n     *  The strengths and weaknesses of the systems that support the\n\n        delivery of treatment, such as referral systems, logistics systems,\n\n        management information systems, etc.;\n\n     *  Organizations that currently deliver good health\n\n        services--especially those with wide networks--that could be\n\n        mobilized to expand their range of services to include HIV/AIDS\n\n\n\n        treatment; and\n\n     *  Policy issues and cultural practices that either support or inhibit\n\n        the capacity to deliver treatment services.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: The Network Model]\n\nSidebar 5: The Network Model \n\nThe results of this rapid assessment will be used to guide Emergency Plan interventions to strengthen the capacity \nof the HIV/AIDS network to deliver treatment within each of the focus countries. Plans for technical assistance, \ntraining, and program interventions will be closely coordinated with host-country counterparts and will be \nconsistent with their national AIDS strategies.\n\nBuilding on established clinical programs\n\nBased on the results of the assessment, the Emergency Plan will mobilize immediately to scale up programs that \nalready deliver ART or that have the necessary medical competence to do so quickly. Using existing programs \n(those already supported by the United States as well as those supported by others) as a platform for scale-up will \nallow for easier replication of best practices, more rapid mobilization of resources through institutions that already \nhave functioning systems, and increased opportunities for twinning successful programs with those that show \npromise. President Bush's Emergency Plan will support communication efforts to prepare communities for the \nintroduction of ARV drugs. Such efforts should describe ARV treatment programs, including the nature of taking \nARVs for life, and include messages to combat the possible misperception that a cure has arrived.\n\nThe second phase of scale-up will focus on those facilities that do not provide ART but do provide good health or \nHIV/AIDS prevention and care services and have networks of sites and personnel that allow for rapid expansion \nand mobilization to provide ARV treatment. Through targeted technical assistance and training, many public health \nfacilities, private FBOs and CBOs, and private commercial facilities in the focus countries will be able to add ART to \ntheir services in a relatively short period of time. FBOs will play an important role, as in some countries in Africa \nnearly half of all medical services are provided through mission hospitals and health centers.\n\nOther programs that offer the possibility for rapid scale-up and development of program synergies include:\n\nTuberculosis control programs. Tuberculosis (TB) is frequently the first manifestation of HIV/AIDS disease and the \nreason many people first present themselves for medical care. Since both tuberculosis treatment and HIV/AIDS \ntreatment require longitudinal care and follow-up, successful TB programs may provide excellent platforms upon \nwhich to build capacity for HIV/AIDS treatment. The Emergency Plan will support TB treatment for those who are \nHIV-infected and develop HIV treatment capacity in TB programs. In addition, interventions that increase the \nnumber of persons diagnosed and treated for HIV/AIDS will increase the need for TB treatment and care services. \nTherefore, action is required to build or maintain necessary tuberculosis treatment capacity. Laboratories, clinical \nstaff, community networks, and management structures used for TB control can be upgraded to accommodate \nHIV/AIDS treatment. Many of the techniques that have been found useful for TB control, such as directly observed \ntherapy, may be applied to monitoring compliance with HIV/AIDS treatment. Because the prevalence of HIV \ninfection is high among persons with tuberculosis, TB programs may be an important site for HIV testing in the \nfocus countries.\n\nMalaria control programs. Malaria infection during pregnancy increases the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission. \nTherefore, the Emergency Plan will strengthen in-country program linkages between HIV/AIDS and malaria \nprograms and provide technical assistance, training, and support to malaria prevention and control initiatives \nfocusing particularly on HIV-positive pregnant women through PMTCT interventions. Bednets, an effective \nantimalarial intervention, will be incorporated into the Emergency Plan's coordination strategy with malaria control \nprograms.\n\nRapidly training and mobilizing health care personnel to provide treatment services\n\n\n\nExpanding the human resources necessary to implement this bold new treatment program will require both short- \nand long-term strategies. In the short term, the immediate need for greater numbers of trained health workers to \nmanage ARV treatment will be met by rapidly expanding the training of existing health workers and supplementing \ntheir capacity with foreign volunteer health professionals. At this stage, technical assistance and in-service training \nwill be the primary vehicles for building the skills of current health workers, including physicians, nurses, community \nhealth workers, pharmacists, and laboratory technicians. Training will focus on building health worker skills to \nimprove ART case management for both adults and children, including administering drugs, monitoring patients for \nside effects and treatment failure, and promoting treatment adherence.\n\nIn order to facilitate rapid expansion, President Bush's Emergency Plan will support local and national efforts to \nbroaden responsibility for patient treatment, care, and support to nurses, lay health workers and counselors, and \nhealth volunteers. Given the enormous human resource constraints, it will be critical to give greater responsibility, \nthrough training and supervision, to greater numbers of health workers in order to achieve treatment goals.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the skills of formally trained medical professionals, and as a way to extend services into \nthe community, President Bush's Emergency Plan will explore options to involve traditional healers, birth \nattendants, family members, and other lay persons in a more substantial way. Building on previous U.S. \nGovernment-funded work in this area, programs will focus on building skills to recognize HIV complications, \nprovide basic home-based care, support patients and caregivers, increase adherence to treatment regimens, and \nrefer patients to appropriate health care services. The Emergency Plan will also support efforts to forge \nrelationships with associations of people living with HIV/AIDS to train their members to provide patient education, \nadherence counseling, and patient follow-up in order to free clinical staff to perform higher-level tasks.\n\nRecruiting and deploying volunteer doctors, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, and other health \nprofessionals from the United States and other nations is another important strategy to meet the human capacity \nneeds for HIV/AIDS treatment. Short-term training and technical assistance by experienced professionals, possibly \nas part of a twinning program, will help fill human resource gaps in key technical areas and provide opportunities \nfor on-the-job training and mentoring of host-country counterparts. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is exploring \nvarious mechanisms and options for facilitating U.S. professionals in this effort under the President's Volunteers for \nProsperity Initiative, including the Peace Corps' Crisis Corps program, Freedom Corps, and other programs. Finally, \ntelemedicine and distance education can be used to build the skills of health professionals in the focus countries \nand strengthen local, national, and international connections among medical institutions.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Volunteers for Prosperity]\n\nSidebar 6: Volunteers for Prosperity \n\nThe twinning of U.S.-based institutions with African or Caribbean institutions (or African with Caribbean or African) \noffers an important means of establishing these types of relationships. The twinning mechanism that is part of \nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will allow the creation and support of \"centers of excellence\" from which \ntraining, research, and talent can be diffused throughout the impacted regions. It is this ongoing sustained support \nfor professional excellence that holds the key to increased capacity for care.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Monitoring Resistance to Antiretroviral Drugs\n\nSidebar 7: Monitoring Resistance to Antiretroviral Drugs \n\nEnhancing the capacity of supply chain management systems to respond to rapid treatment scale-up\n\nThe development and implementation of logistics systems to manage the increased volume of products needed for \nan expanded treatment program will require both short- and long-term strategies. During rapid scale-up, the focus \nwill be on procuring and delivering a continuous and secure supply of high-quality products to patients at all levels \nof the health system.\n\nIn most countries, the sharp increase in the volume of products provided through the Emergency Plan and other \nnew sources such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria will likely challenge existing \n\n\n\nnational supply systems. To facilitate rapid implementation of effective procurement and delivery systems, \nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will explore options to enhance the immediate performance of national logistics \nsystems through:\n\n     *  Centralized or pooled procurement mechanisms at global or regional\n\n        levels, including collaboration with other donor-funded\n\n        programs--e.g., the Global Fund, the World Bank's Multi-Country\n\n        HIV/AIDS Program for Africa (MAP), and WHO--and direct product\n\n        donations;\n\n     *  Outsourced transportation to secure courier services or purchase of\n\n        dedicated vehicles for ARV drug delivery;\n\n     *  Design of user-friendly, timely, and accurate methods of logistics\n\n        data capture, collection, analysis, and feedback for resupply and\n\n        forecasting;\n\n     *  Product selection and packaging for better adherence;\n\n     *  Provision of skilled people to perform logistics management\n\n        functions;\n\n     *  Strengthened collaboration between supply chain managers and\n\n        program service managers to ensure coordination of patient\n\n        enrollment and supply needs;\n\n     *  Improvements in secure storage space and inventory management; and\n\n     *  Facilitated development of national coordinating bodies to schedule\n\n        donor financial and commodity commitments, develop medium-term\n\n        procurement plans, and track actual funds and products received in\n\n        order to avoid duplication of investment.\n\nFor more information on supply chain management issues, see chapter X, Supportive Interventions for U.S. \nGovernment Programs, Supply Chain Management.\n\n2. Build capacity for long-term sustainability of quality HIV/AIDS treatment programs\n\nWhile mobilizing rapid scale-up for treatment availability, the Emergency Plan will also lay the foundation for \nsustainable high-quality treatment programs. This will be accomplished by:\n\n     *  Strengthening national human resource capacity through health care\n\n        worker recruitment and retention strategies, longer-term training,\n\n        and technical assistance;\n\n     *  Establishing, disseminating, and implementing treatment protocols;\n\n     *  Developing the capacity of new partners; and\n\n     *  Developing and strengthening health infrastructure.\n\nStrengthening national human resource capacity through health care worker recruitment and retention strategies, \nlonger-term training, and technical assistance\n\n\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will focus on building long-term human resource capacity through training and \ntechnical assistance that directly supports national strategic plans for scale-up of HIV/AIDS programs. Short- and \nlong-term training is the backbone of this strategy, including the incorporation of PMTCT and ART content into the \nbasic training programs for doctors, pharmacists, laboratory technologists, nurses, and midwives, including \nrotational practice. Activities include:\n\n     *  Curriculum development to incorporate management of HIV-related\n\n        illness into the basic package of care offered thorough routine\n\n        health services, including methodologies for promoting treatment\n\n        adherence;\n\n     *  Technical assistance and training to improve ART case management,\n\n        including promoting adherence and monitoring patients for side\n\n        effects, treatment failure, toxicity, and contraindications;\n\n     *  Technical assistance and training in improved supervision and\n\n        quality assurance;\n\n     *  Technical assistance in long-term planning for infrastructure and\n\n        manpower requirements;\n\n     *  Development of innovative training programs, including faculty and\n\n        student exchange programs and a practicum for health workers that\n\n        allows trainees to gain experience in HIV/AIDS management by\n\n        working under supervision in health clinics or hospitals providing\n\n        high-quality treatment programs;\n\n     *  Technical assistance to promote and improve treatment literacy for\n\n        clients, through patient education, counseling, and community\n\n        outreach to inform patients and their families about the drugs they\n\n        are receiving, management of side effects, and the importance of\n\n        adherence; and\n\n     *  Promotion of policies to support the recruitment and retention of\n\n        qualified health care professionals.\n\nEstablishing, disseminating, and implementing treatment protocols\n\nIt is important that every country have evidence -based national guidelines and protocols for managing ART and \nopportunistic infections. These guidelines and protocols must be constantly updated to reflect the nature of the \nepidemic and \"state of the art\" treatment, and they are an important tool for improving the quality of HIV/AIDS care. \nThus, President Bush's Emergency Plan will:\n\n     *  Provide technical assistance and training to health ministries and\n\n        professional organizations to strengthen the development,\n\n        dissemination, and implementation of national guidelines and\n\n        protocols for ART and treatment of opportunistic infections, based\n\n        on evidence and experience gained in local settings and\n\n\n\n        incorporating knowledge of the local health infrastructure and\n\n        epidemiology of the epidemic in each country; and\n\n     *  Provide technical assistance to develop clinical care guidelines\n\n        and ARV regimens for children (which can significantly differ from\n\n        those for adults), including methodologies for addressing treatment\n\n        adherence and psychosocial support.\n\nDeveloping and strengthening HIV/AIDS-related health infrastructure\n\nA strong health infrastructure is the foundation that supports effective planning, delivery, and evaluation of \nHIV/AIDS treatment programs. Currently, health infrastructure within the focus countries is often not equipped to \nsupport the sustainable high-quality treatment services necessary to effectively address the epidemic. Thus, the \nPresident's Emergency Plan will provide targeted technical assistance, training, and funding to improve and \nexpand the infrastructure necessary to ensure optimal delivery of HIV/AIDS treatment services. By looking at the \nrequirements at each level of care--and the linkages between them--support will be provided to:\n\n     *  Equip health facilities and mobile units utilized for HIV/AIDS\n\n        treatment services;\n\n     *  Upgrade routine health information systems to improve treatment\n\n        data management;\n\n     *  Strengthen research and surveillance capacity;\n\n     *  Develop twinning mechanisms for the broad engagement of\n\n        institutions across a full range of infrastructure-strengthening\n\n        activities;\n\n     *  Support effective product procurement, storage, and distribution;\n\n     *  Strengthen financial and management systems; and\n\n     *  Improve laboratory capacity to diagnose infection and monitor ARV\n\n        treatment.\n\nDeveloping the capacity of new partners\n\nIn order to achieve its ambitious treatment goals, the Emergency Plan must help focus countries link communities \nwith treatment services on an enormous scale. To facilitate this, the President's initiative seeks to leverage the \ncomparative strengths of a wide range of different public and private sector partners to dramatically increase the \nnumber and reach of organizations providing treatment services. Activities to identify and engage new and \ninnovative partners include outreach to and capacity building of:\n\nFaith-based and community partners currently providing HIV/AIDS prevention and care services to add treatment \nsupport to their slate of services. Faith-based and other community partners have extensive reach and legitimacy in \nlocal communities and are among the most experienced organizations in providing HIV/AIDS prevention and care \nservices. Expanding their services to treatment support will require training in both the technical aspects of \ntreatment support services and building institutional capacity in program planning, financial and program \nmanagement, and evaluation.\n\nCorporate sector partners with resources and innovations to contribute. The corporate sector is a vibrant force for \ndevelopment worldwide. Partners from the corporate sector have enormous potential to bring significant new \nresources and innovative ideas to the tight against AIDS. The President's Emergency Plan will provide technical \nassistance to help the corporate sector identify ways to support and expand treatment programs through improved \nworkplace policies, delivery of services, the leveraging of commercial resources, and the application of new \n\n\n\ntechnologies. Business \"champions\" who provide effective HIV/AIDS treatment and care support services will be \nidentified. President Bush's Emergency Plan will also coordinate with private corporations to include treatment \nservices for community members in their corporate health facilities.\n\nPrivate sector networks such as unions and agricultural collectives to strengthen treatment programs through \nworkplace-based HIV/AIDS programs, with support to employees and families where appropriate.\n\n3. Advance policy initiatives that support treatment\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will provide support to governments to implement their national HIV/AIDS \nstrategic plans and develop a comprehensive set of policies to support their implementation through a collaborative \nprocess involving stakeholders across multiple sectors. Most of the focus countries have committed to uphold the \nhuman rights of people living with HIV/AIDS and have begun to formulate policies in alignment with the 2001 United \nNations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. \nMost have begun to consider how to address a wide range of HIV-related policies. President Bush's Emergency \nPlan will help create a strong enabling environment that will support the expansion of high-quality treatment \nprograms by:\n\n     *  Providing technical assistance in policy development, and\n\n     *  Building political commitment.\n\nProviding technical assistance in policy development\n\nAs accessibility to treatment is a relatively new phenomenon in the focus countries, the policies and structures \nneeded to support effective planning, implementation, and evaluation of treatment programs are generally not yet in \nplace. Policy reform to support HIV/AIDS treatment must begin immediately to ensure successful expansion of \ntreatment services under the Emergency Plan. Treatment-related policy issues that may need to be addressed \nthrough technical assistance include:\n\n     *  Product registration;\n\n     *  Development of standard treatment guidelines and essential drug\n\n        lists;\n\n     *  Drug procurement and financing;\n\n     *  Compliance with the World Trade Organization Agreement on\n\n        Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and\n\n        other trade agreements;\n\n     *  Regulations related to importation and taxation of drugs and\n\n        medical supplies/equipment;\n\n     *  Human resources policies, including broadened responsibilities for\n\n        HIV treatment and opportunities for testing and diagnosis, so more\n\n        nurses and community health workers can deliver care;\n\n     *  Appropriate resource allocation and flow of national resources to\n\n        HIV/AIDS programs;\n\n     *  Barriers to treatment caused by stigma and discrimination;\n\n     *  Insurance coverage of ART; and\n\n     *  Administrative policy relating to health sector reform.\n\nBuilding political commitment\n\n\n\nA primary strategy of President Bush's Emergency Plan is to build political commitment at the highest levels of \ngovernment and ensure that a nation's policies and infrastructure support this commitment. Every opportunity will \nbe used to make a persuasive case to formal and informal leaders of national governments, businesses, and faith-\nbased and nonprofit organizations to follow President Bush's lead and take effective action and make compelling \nchoices in support of treatment as a critical component of an effective HIV/AIDS program. The Emergency Plan \nwill mobilize all the resources incumbent in the agencies it coordinates to convey the importance of HIV/AIDS \ntreatment to national and international programs. It will support government, NGO, and private sector leaders to \ngarner public support for effective policies and adequate resources for treatment programs. Public diplomacy and \ncommunication are essential in assembling the resources, political support, and citizen support needed to make a \ntangible, sustainable impact.\n\n4. Collect strategic information to monitor and evaluate progress and ensure compliance with Emergency Plan and \nnational policies and strategies\n\nPresident Bush has insisted that his Emergency Plan place a high priority on maintaining program integrity, \nensuring accountability, and assuring compliance with U.S. Government polices. A strategic information system to \nmonitor treatment implementation and impact will be built upon:\n\n     *  Surveillance information to track HIV incidence, prevalence, and\n\n        mortality;\n\n     *  Program monitoring information to measure provider capacity to\n\n        treat clients, including individuals receiving ART and associated\n\n        supply chain management and clinical care;\n\n     *  Targeted evaluations to support evidence-based decisions regarding\n\n        clinical programs; and\n\n     *  Management information systems to increase data storage and flow.\n\nAn appropriate information technology framework has the potential to revolutionize the health information system \nsupporting clinical care, program management, and international reporting. A strategic information system provides \na vehicle for identifying those elements of a program that are most successful and highlighting those that could be \nmore effective.\n\nThe Emergency Plan will help countries effectively collect and use appropriate data for decision-making and \nreporting on progress toward the achievement of results. A second critical activity is to harmonize indicators and \nreporting systems with international agencies such as UNAIDS and WHO and major international donors such as \nthe Global Fund and the World Bank. Balance must be achieved between the need for immediate reports and \nresults (e.g., timely demonstration of PMTCT core indicators) and the long-term objectives of building HIV country \nreporting capacity and institutionalizing locally useful and sustainable health information systems.\n\nVI. CRITICAL INTERVENTIONS IN THE FOCUS COUNTRIES: Care\n\n        \"Fighting AIDS on a global scale is a massive and complicated\n\n        undertaking. Yet, this cause is rooted in the simplest of moral\n\n        duties. When we see this kind of preventable suffering, when we see\n\n        a plague leaving graves and orphans across a continent, we must\n\n        act. When we see the wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we\n\n        will not, America will not pass to the other side of the road.\"\n\n        President George W. Bush, April 29, 2003\n\n\n\nThe care activities of President Bush's Emergency Plan will comprise palliative care for people with HIV/AIDS and \ncare for children orphaned by AIDS and other vulnerable children. Palliative care spans a continuum of care from \nthe time a person is diagnosed with HIV infection until death. The continuum of palliative care includes routine \nclinical care to evaluate the need for symptom relief (from diarrhea or headache, for example); treatment for \nHIV/AIDS-related diseases such as tuberculosis and opportunistic infections; preparing people for antiretroviral \ntherapy where that is possible; and, when treatment is not available or has failed, compassionate end-of-life care.\n\nHIV/AIDS and associated opportunistic infections cause severe pain, debilitating symptoms and death. Oral and \nesophageal infections can make eating and swallowing painful or impossible. Uncontrolled diarrhea can cause \nweakness to the point of total disability, and many of the conditions associated with HIV/AIDS cause severe pain. \nPneumonia and other opportunistic infections can, if left untreated, kill. If basic HIV/AIDS care, supportive care, and \ncompassionate end-of-life care for people living with AIDS are not provided, the burden of suffering, morbidity, and \nearly death will continue on an immense scale.\n\nAdded to the millions who live in daily pain and suffering as a result, of HIV/AIDS are the millions of orphans--over \n13 million children under the age of 15--left to grow up without the love and support of their parents. Without \nwidespread access to basic needs such as food and shelter and essential services such as education and health \ncare, this population of children is acutely vulnerable to a host of dangers, including HIV/AIDS, and can themselves \nbecome a high-risk population fueling the pandemic.\n\nBasic medical care, including treatment of opportunistic infections, symptom management, and end-of-life care and \nsupport, is currently out of reach for many millions of people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, including orphans \nand other vulnerable children. Little end-of-life care is available to aggressively address symptoms, pain, and \nsuffering. Basic care and social support needs are currently being addressed, in large part, by family members and \nneighbors, responding in whatever way they can to fellow community members in crisis. The enormous burdens of \ncare are, however, stretching communities to the breaking point. The lack of services to meet basic care needs not \nonly contributes to daily suffering for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS-related morbidity also \nreduces the productivity of both people with HIV/AIDS and their care providers. It diverts scarce family resources as \nincome shifts to health care needs and affects social stability as people are unable to work, parent, teach, or carry \nout other social responsibilities.\n\nWomen bear the greatest burden of care--a load that negatively affects not only them but also their children and \nfamilies. In most of the focus countries, families earn their subsistence through agriculture. Women are the major \ncontributors to the agricultural workforce, feeding their families and earning a meager family income in the \nmarketplace. When women's health deteriorates, or when they must provide care to other family and community \nmembers, basic needs such as food security come under threat. Thus, the lack of consistent care services \ncontributes to many of the most severe consequences of HIV/AIDS and perpetuates the vicious cycle of poverty \nand HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe lack of strong care systems also fuels stigma and denial. As communities come under increasing strain, \nindividuals who need care are increasingly left to fend for themselves. Rejection and discrimination feed fear and \nhopelessness and keep people from internalizing prevention messages or seeking testing and treatment.\n\nHIV/AIDS care, then, has an enormous role to play in reducing AIDS-related morbidity, relieving stress on families \nand mitigating consequences of disease. Many faith- and community-based groups have been the first organized \nresponders to the demands for care and have worked to strengthen and support family and community care \nstrategies. President Bush's Emergency Plan will build on these and other opportunities, including national \nstrategies to provide care for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, to expand, strengthen, and improve the \nquality and sustainability of programs to meet the needs of those now suffering, including orphans and vulnerable \nchildren.\n\nCare Objective:\n\nProvide care and support to 10 million people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS including orphans and \nvulnerable children in the focus countries\n\nCare Strategies:\n\n\n\n1. Rapidly scale up existing palliative care services (basic health care and support services, including symptom \nmanagement, social and emotional support, and end-of-life care, for persons living with HIV/AIDS); rapidly scale up \nexisting care services for orphans and vulnerable children\n\n2. Build capacity for long-term sustainability of palliative care (basic health care and support services, including end-\nof-life care, for persons living with HIV/AIDS); build capacity for long-term sustainability of care services for orphans \nand vulnerable children\n\n3. Advance policy initiatives that support basic health care and support, including palliative care, and care for \norphans and vulnerable children\n\n4. Collect strategic information to monitor and evaluate progress and ensure compliance with Emergency Plan \npolicies and strategies\n\nThis care goal includes both care for orphans and vulnerable children as well as basic health care and support, \nincluding symptom management, social and emotional support and end-of-life care, for persons living with \nHIV/AIDS. Because of programmatic differences these will be discussed separately below. Additionally, many of \nthe strategies and interventions that apply to care (such as supply chain management) are described in detail \nelsewhere in this document.\n\n1. Palliative Care\n\n1. Rapidly scale up existing palliative care services\n\nCurrently, palliative care needed by those living with HIV/AIDS is not widely available in the target countries. Most \ncountries' ministries of health support district health centers, clinics, and hospitals but few of these are adequately \nstaffed or equipped to meet the basic health care needs of large numbers of people living with HIV/AIDS. Hospitals \nand clinics supported by faith-based and other nongovernmental organizations also often lack supplies and trained \npersonnel needed to address non-ARV treatment for the HIV-infected.\n\nEnd-of-life care is now provided through some 40 hospice programs. These, by themselves, are inadequate to meet \nthe need posed by this crisis. The number of people needing pain and symptom management as well as social, \npsychological, and practical support is simply too large. Home-based care programs have provided support to large \nnumbers of individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS but rarely have the health care capacity or capability to \nprovide minimum standards of palliative care. Principles of palliative care must be applied throughout the course of \nillness as well as at the end of life.\n\nOperational strategies for rapid scale-up of basic health care, including palliative and end-of-life care include:\n\n     *  Providing technical assistance and training to build and expand the\n\n        capacity of existing care services;\n\n     *  Providing technical assistance and training to build and expand the\n\n        capacity of health care personnel;\n\n     *  Integrating care services with current prevention and treatment\n\n        programs; and\n\n     *  Using U.S. volunteers.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Basic Health Care and Support, Including End-of-Life Care]\n\nBasic Health Care and Support, Including End-of-Life Care\n\nNot all people living with HIV/AIDS need anti-retroviral treatment. All do need basic health care and support, \nhowever. When ART is not available, or it tails, many will require symptom management, social and emotional \nsupport and compassionate end-of-life care. Basic health care and support includes routine monitoring of disease \n\n\n\nprogression, prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections, cancers, and other complications of immune \nsuppression.\n\nPalliative care and support goes beyond the medical management of infectious, neurological, or oncological \ncomplications of HIV/AIDS, arid addresses symptoms and suffering directly. Building upon definitions of palliative \ncare developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services \nAdministration (HRSA) and WHO, President Bush's Emergency Plan envisions expansion of an intradisciplinary \napproach to palliative care and support making use of interventions to relieve physical, emotional, practical, and \nspiritual suffering.\n\nPalliative care that Includes basic health care and support, symptom management, and end-of-life care will involve \nthe following elements:\n\n     *  Routine clinical monitoring and management of HIV/AIDS complications\n\n     *  Opportunistic infection prophylaxis and treatment\n\n     *  Management of opportunistic cancers\n\n     *  Management of neurological and other diseases associated with\n\n        HIV/AIDS\n\n     *  Symptom diagnosis and relief\n\n     *  Social support, including organization of basic necessities such as\n\n        nutrition, financial assistance, legal aid, housing, and permanency\n\n        planning\n\n End-of-life care\n\n     *  Mental health care and support\n\n     *  Social support including organization of basic necessities such as\n\n        nutrition, financial assistance, legal aid, housing, and permanency\n\n        planning\n\n     *  Support for caregivers\n\n     *  Bereavement support for family members\n\nProviding technical assistance and training to build and expand the capacity of existing care services\n\nFamilies and communities are already responding to the needs of those living with HIV/AIDS. Most often these \ninformal caregivers are not adequately trained or supported. Building and expanding these networks by providing \ntargeted technical assistance and education will help to increase their capacity and effectiveness. The Emergency \nPlan will work with existing health care delivery sites (public and private), hospices, home-based care providers, \nfaith-based facilities, and other points of health care delivery to offer on-site training, technical assistance, and \nongoing education for providers.\n\nProviding technical assistance and training to build and expand the capacity of health care personnel\n\nSpecific medical and nursing training (focusing on prevention, recognition, and treatment of HIV complications and \npain and symptom management) will be especially important to achieve rapid scale-up of basic health care \nservices, including palliative and end-of-life care, for the HIV-infected in target countries. Following local policies, \npractices, and professional standards, nurses and other health care personnel may be given expanded training to \nextend the reach of basic health care systems into rural or remote areas. These health care personnel can also \ntrain community volunteers and family members in skills needed to provide home care.\n\nIntegrating care services with current prevention and treatment programs\n\n\n\nExisting prevention and treatment programs offer another opportunity for expanding care, which in turn will \nstrengthen prevention and treatment interventions. President Bush's Emergency Plan will seek to layer care \nservices onto existing prevention and treatment programs by providing additional training for staff. This strategy \nestablishes other important links between services--many who receive symptom management may be able to \nprogress to ARV therapy. Also, palliative and end-of-life care interventions provide unique opportunities to promote \nprevention messages and should help inform messages used in behavior change programs. For example, involving \nat-risk youth as volunteers in care programs can help overcome stigma and denial and contribute to behavior \nchange.\n\nUsing U.S. Volunteers\n\nU.S. volunteers may provide an additional resource for rapid scale-up of care. A rapid local assessment of skills \nneeded must be undertaken in order to ensure that there is an appropriate and helpful match of talent with need. In \nthe early rapid scale-up phase of implementation, it is likely specific technical skills in nursing, medicine, social \nwork, palliative care, and pharmacy will be in greatest demand.\n\n2. Build capacity for long-term sustainability of palliative care\n\nAs is the case for increasing long-term capacity for ART, increasing the availability of basic health care and support, \nincluding end-of-life care, will require a sustained partnership with ministries of health, nongovernmental \norganizations, professional associations, and training institutions. The provision of basic health care and support \nservices, including end-of-life care, must be based upon an adequate supply of professionals--doctors, nurses, \nsocial workers, pharmacists, and others. These individuals must be trained and provided with on-going continuing \neducation, in topics relevant to the care of HIV-infected patients. A great deal of attention must be given, therefore, \nto establishing long-term professional and institutional relationships so that ongoing professional communications \nand referrals can be supported.\n\nThe twinning of U.S.-based institutions with African or Caribbean institutions (or African with Caribbean or African) \noffers an important means of establishing these types of relationships. The twinning mechanism that is part of the \nEmergency Plan will allow the creation and support of \"centers of excellence\" from which training, research, and \ntalent can be diffused throughout the impacted regions. It is this ongoing sustained support for professional \nexcellence that holds the key to increased capacity for care.\n\nIncreasing long-term capacity for end-of-life care poses some special problems. End-of-life care is a well-\nestablished field in only a few areas of the world. It is only now gaining stature in the United States, and in Africa \nthere are only two academically associated training programs in end-of-life care and only about 40 hospices in all of \nthe focus countries. A strategy that will advance palliative care will involve, therefore, capacity building in African \nand Caribbean academic training institutions, aggressive in-service training, and continuing education. Partnerships \nin this regard between the U.S. and other developed nations where end-of-life care is well established may be \nespecially useful. Establishment and support of twinned hospices will also provide support and opportunities for \ntraining and technical assistance.\n\nOperational strategies for building long-term sustain-ability for basic health care and support, including palliative \ncare, include:\n\n     *  Technical assistance for development of appropriate care protocols;\n\n     *  Twinning;\n\n     *  Curriculum change in health professional schools;\n\n     *  Expansion and integration of hospice services;\n\n     *  Identifying new public-private partnership opportunities; and\n\n     *  Provision of essential supplies.\n\n3. Advance policy initiatives that support basic health care and support, including palliative care\n\nPolicy reform must begin immediately to establish an environment that is conducive to the implementation of the \nbasic health care and support and palliative care interventions and services described in this strategy. A key priority \n\n\n\nof the Emergency Plan will be to support implementation of good policies and effective legislation, in concert with \nnational strategies and cognizant of local needs, particularly at the community level.\n\nStrategic approaches will include the following areas:\n\n     *  Human resources policy reform and development, including the\n\n        broadening of responsibility for HIV/AIDS clinical care to lower\n\n        levels of care providers, and policy reforms to recruit and\n\n        encourage retention of care professionals; and\n\n     *  Policy reforms to increase availability of pain medications.\n\nHuman resources policy reform and development\n\nFocus countries face severe shortages of health care professionals. Devolving care skills and responsibilities to \nlower levels of care providers, such as nurses and clinic staff, will greatly increase the pool and reach of care \nproviders.\n\nIn addition, recruiting doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals from countries with a surplus may be a \nshort-term strategy for increasing the number of care providers in a given country. The Emergency Plan will work \nwith policymakers to support the changes in immigration policy necessary to implement this strategy in the focus \ncountries.\n\nDifficulties in retaining trained health professionals are another common problem in these countries.\n\nPolicies to counteract the \"brain drain\" will be encouraged, as will programs to increase provider job satisfaction. \nSome of this policy work must be done on a regional basis to counteract cross-border migration of health \nprofessionals.\n\nPolicy reforms to increase availability of pain medications\n\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS often need opioids and other analgesics to treat pain and mitigate other symptoms. \nThe Emergency Plan will work with local regulatory authorities to remove barriers to the availability of these \nmedications and to ensure they are used appropriately and not diverted for illicit use. Specific areas of activity may \ninclude:\n\n     *  Implementation of policies to expand the use of oral opioids\n\n        (through, for example, working with community leaders to translate\n\n        national policy changes into action);\n\n     *  Liberalization of laws restricting medicinal use of opioids;\n\n     *  Expanding the ability of nurses to dispense pain medication,\n\n        including opioids, especially in the home setting; and\n\n     *  Strengthening of laws to prevent diversion of opioids for illicit\n\n        purposes.\n\n4. Collect strategic information to monitor and evaluate progress and ensure compliance with Emergency Plan \npolicies and strategies\n\nA strong evidence base will support the Emergency Plan to provide services to relieve suffering. Palliative and \nrelated care supports both those who receive and those who do not receive ART. Strategic information to support \ncare must measure both home-and clinic-based activities. Outcomes will be measured through surveillance \nactivities, especially population-based surveys. Provider information on care capacity, training, and services will \nprovide data to monitor the progress of care programs on an ongoing basis. Targeted evaluations will identity best \ncare practices. A management information system will provide the backbone for reporting information.\n\n\n\nThe goals of providing care to 10 million individuals (palliative care and care for orphans and vulnerable children) \nover the five-year period will be measured using a variety of service-based statistics, surveys, and special studies. \nIndicators for measuring Emergency Plan progress toward achievement of care goals will include numbers of \nindividuals served, numbers of persons trained to deliver care, and number of service delivery programs supported.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Meeting the Needs of Afflicted Families]\n\nSidebar 8: Meeting the Needs of Afflicted Families \n\n2. Care for Orphans and Vulnerable Children\n\nChildren affected by HIV/AIDS have the same basic needs--economic and food security, education, nutrition, \nhealth, and emotional well-being--as other children, but the pandemic's impact is eroding family and community \ncapacity to meet these needs. AIDS is having a negative impact on the education, nutrition, health, economic and \nfood security, and emotional well-being of children, including orphans and other children affected by AIDS. A variety \nof strategies must be used, depending on local context. Research has shown that resources--financial, human, \npublic services--vary between and within countries. In many places, communities are mobilized and have systems \nin place to identify, protect, and provide basic necessities to the most vulnerable children. In other places--even in \nneighboring communities--the response from the community is minimal. Therefore, specific interventions must \nultimately be based on identifying and strengthening already existing resources in a manner that does not \nundermine them. Areas of particular vulnerability in specific locations must be identified and interventions \ndeveloped to strengthen existing community initiatives and fill the gaps. The exact mix of services provided and the \nnumber of beneficiaries will differ by location, existing resources, and types of vulnerability faced by the children in \nthe intervention area.\n\nDonors, governments, and NGOs should recognize that families, communities, and children themselves are the \nfront-line of response to HIV/AIDS. Traditional community mechanisms for orphan care, in many cases, have been \noverwhelmed by the sheer numbers of orphans, yet that number is set to rise as high as 25 million by 2010. Thus, \ndeveloping and strengthening local structures is of primary importance in laying the foundation for future efforts that \nwill support the growing numbers of children affected by HIV/AIDS. Funding and activities must support \ncommunities in ways that do not undermine community ownership of interventions or the long-term capacity of \ncommunities to respond. Outside assistance should accordingly focus on engaging in long-term partnerships to \nsupport, strengthen, and sustain ongoing community initiatives through training and technical assistance, \norganizational development, and sustained financial and material support.\n\nTwo other overarching principles apply in President Bush's Emergency Plan's strategic approach to care for \norphans and other vulnerable children. Because targeting specific categories of children can lead to increased \nstigmatization and discrimination, the Emergency Plan specifically identities \"orphans and other vulnerable \nchildren\" as beneficiaries of care. Directing program efforts exclusively to children with a parent or parents who \nhave HIV infection or have died of AIDS is both unrealistic and detrimental to those children. In addition, efforts \nshould not focus solely on children whose parent or parents have already died. Long before they become orphans, \nchildren experience severe distress as a result of living with--and often caring for--a terminally ill parent. Throughout \nthe world, communities have mobilized and developed systems to identify, prioritize, and care for those who are \nmost vulnerable. These systems, where effective and sustainable, will be supported.\n\nFinally, President Bush's Emergency Plan will seek where possible to support, family and community mechanisms \nas opposed to institutional care. Alternatives to traditional orphanages, such as community-based resource centers, \ncontinue to evolve in response to the massive number of orphans left behind by the AIDS epidemic. These centers \nhelp families continue to support children within the community, providing support groups, counseling, temporary \nmedical care for HIV-infected children, training in parenting skills, skills training programs for older children, and \ndaycare for parents or foster parents who need relief. They can also prevent children from entering the worst forms \nof child labor.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, however, institution-based activities are necessary. For abandoned children or children living on the \nstreet, an institution might be the only alternative to death from exposure and starvation. The challenge is to \ndevelop better alternatives, such as emergency and long-term foster care and local adoption. In addition, there has \nbeen an increase in facility-based palliative care for children living with HIV/AIDS. Many of these institutions are \nalso reaching out to provide care in local communities.\n\nThe Emergency Plan will help build, strengthen, and improve the quality and sustainability of programs to meet the \nneeds of orphans and vulnerable children through rapid scale-up, capacity building, strengthening the enabling \nenvironment, and tracking progress and establishing best practices.\n\n1. Rapidly scale up care services for orphans and vulnerable children\n\nRapid scale-up of services and support systems for orphans and other vulnerable children will rely on improving the \nquality and expanding the reach of existing responses. Rapid scale-up will be guided by the following operational \nstrategies:\n\n     *  Strengthening the capacity of families to cope with their problems;\n\n     *  Mobilizing and strengthening community-based responses;\n\n     *  Increasing the capacity of children to become proactive in meeting\n\n        their own needs; and\n\n     *  Integrating care services with existing prevention and care\n\n        programs.\n\nStrengthening the capacity of families to cope with their problems\n\nSince the first and most important responses to HIV/AIDS are carried out by affected children, families, and \ncommunities, President Bush's Emergency Plan will support projects to increase the capacity of families and \ncommunities to provide care and support to children affected by the epidemic. Activities might include training \ncaregivers, increasing access to education, promoting the use of time-and labor-saving technologies, supporting \nincome-generating activities, and connecting children and families to essential health and social services where \navailable.\n\nMobilizing and strengthening community-based responses\n\nAfter family, the community is the next safety net for children affected by HIV/AIDS. The Emergency Plan will both \nprovide direct support to community efforts and build the capacity of local NGOs and CBOs to support a greater \nnumber of community initiatives. Community support includes providing mentors for emotional support, resources \nsuch as food and school-related expenses, household help, child care, and farm labor. Other programs provide \nchildren and families with legal assistance to protect property rights and ensure protection from abuse.\n\nIncreasing the capacity of children and young people to become proactive in meeting their own needs\n\nChildren and adolescents affected by HIV/AIDS are active participants in mitigating the pandemic's impact, moving \nbeyond the role of recipients of assistance. For example, young people are increasingly involved in making home \nvisits to orphans and vulnerable children and helping HIV/AIDS-affected households. Additionally, the Emergency \nPlan will support initiatives that ensure that children and adolescents stay in school, are trained in vocational skills, \nand receive adequate nutrition and health services.\n\nIntegrating care services with existing prevention and care programs\n\nPrograms that focus on care for vulnerable children within the context of services for the greater population of \npeople living with HIV/AIDS can enhance both prevention and care services. For example, adding care components \nsuch as access to medicine and food to prevention programs can draw in new populations for HIV/AIDS education. \nPrograms that support to HIV-positive women and their families, including their children, could be added to \nHIV/AIDS testing at sites offering PMTCT services. Special programs should also be developed for child victims of \nsexual exploitations and children working in prostitution.\n\n\n\n2. Build capacity for long-term sustainability of care services for orphans and vulnerable children\n\nGiven the current disease burden in highly impacted countries, the number of orphans will continue to rise over the \nnext decade. Thus, President Bush's Emergency Plan will pursue the following strategies in building capacity for \nsustainable quality care programs:\n\n     *  Strengthening the organizational capacity of community- and\n\n        faith-based organizations to address the needs of orphans and other\n\n        vulnerable children;\n\n     *  Strengthening early interventions with at-risk youth;\n\n     *  Promoting collaboration and coordination among partners for a\n\n        long-term response; and\n\n     *  Identifying new public-private partnership opportunities.\n\nStrengthening the organizational capacity of community- and faith-based organizations to address the needs of \norphans and other vulnerable children\n\nBuilding the organizational capacity of community -and faith-based groups is essential to ensuring long-term \navailability of care. The Emergency Plan will support activities to improve management skills, including planning, \nmonitoring and evaluation, resource mobilization, and networking.\n\nStrengthening early interventions with at-risk youth\n\nSpecial efforts are needed to reach those young people, including orphans, who are most vulnerable to early sexual \nactivity and other risky behaviors. These young people who are at highest risk are often hard to reach because they \nare not enrolled in school, do not attend religious institutions, and do not participate in mainstream youth \norganizations. Youth who lack parental support are especially vulnerable. President Bush's Emergency Plan will \nsupport CBOs, especially faith-based groups, for early outreach and intervention to prevent transactional and \nsurvival sex among these extremely vulnerable young people. These local groups will be supported to reach these \nyoung people early with HIV education, counseling, and social support to encourage abstinence and other safer \nbehaviors.\n\nPromoting collaboration and coordination among partners for a long-term response\n\nThe impact of HIV/AIDS around the world is so large and growing so rapidly that no single government, \ninternational organization, or donor can unilaterally make a sufficient difference. Collaborative action is key to \nmobilizing resources to better address the overwhelming needs that continue to escalate among children in AIDS-\naffected areas. Programs will be encouraged not only to coordinate their efforts with other stakeholders but to \nactively work to build collaborative responses to address the problems at scale and unify and expand the response \nto children and adolescents affected by HIV/AIDS.\n\nIdentifying new public-private partnership opportunities\n\nThe magnitude of the problems of orphans and vulnerable children will require the active involvement of a large \nnumber of new partners and significant leveraging of private sector resources. Industry and labor have long-\nstanding social protection programs that will be mobilized to provide services to orphans and vulnerable children. \nThe Emergency Plan will provide technical assistance to identify and support AIDS-affected youth and adults as \ncandidates for jobs and, through partnerships with businesses, will link candidates to job opportunities with \nemployers seeking to sustain and grow jobs in vulnerable communities. The President's initiative will also actively \nencourage corporations to provide direct services or seed-funding for community initiatives to help orphans and \nother vulnerable children. Public-private partnerships will support a number of strategies to mobilize and coordinate \ncommunity care initiatives, including collaborative efforts of employers to address community problems collectively \nand industry/labor support for government efforts to provide care to this vulnerable population.\n\n3. Advance policy initiatives that support care for orphans and vulnerable children\n\n\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will work with government ministries and other organizations in focus countries \nto support initiatives to institute policy, program, and operational reforms, including reforms to ensure access to \nbasic social services and to create special protection and care measures for children outside families and \ncommunities. Activities will promote supportive environments for vulnerable children and include advocacy for basic \nlegal protections, transformation of public perceptions of HIV/AIDS, and strengthened school-based HIV prevention \nand care programs.\n\nTo support the Emergency Plan programs that will meet the needs of millions of orphans and vulnerable children, \nsome critical policy areas must be addressed. These policy areas cover issues related to:\n\n     *  Inheritances and succession,\n\n     *  Bereavement among children,\n\n     *  Child-headed households,\n\n     *  Access to education and school-related expenses, and\n\n     *  Protective services (e.g., against abuse, trafficking, child\n\n        prostitution, and other worst forms of child labor, etc.).\n\n4. Collect strategic information to monitor and evaluate progress and ensure compliance with Emergency Plan \npolicies and strategies\n\nThere is a long history of measuring care and support for orphans and vulnerable children. This history will form the \nbasis of measuring progress toward achieving Emergency Plan goals in support of these children. Measurement \nwill include:\n\n     *  Population-based surveys of care and support for orphans and\n\n        vulnerable children;\n\n     *  Program monitoring of provider capacity and training;\n\n     *  Targeted evaluations of best practices for outreach to and care for\n\n        orphans and vulnerable children; and\n\n     *  Management information systems to strengthen data transmission and\n\n        storage.\n\nThe goal is to provide strategic information to programs, countries, donors, and the U.S. Government to strengthen \nthe accountability and improvement of programs for orphans and vulnerable children. This strategic information \nstrategy will support evaluation of programs on a timely basis, making it possible to discard models that are not \nworking and to identify the best practices that contribute towards the care goals of President Bush's Emergency \nPlan.\n\nVII. STRENGTHENING BILATERAL HIV/AIDS PROGRAMS\n\n        \"By the legislation I will sign today, the United States of\n\n        America will take the side of individuals and groups and\n\n        governments fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa and of the world. We'll\n\n        provide unprecedented resources to the effort. And we will keep out\n\n        commitment until we have turned the tide against AIDS,\"\n\n        President George W. Bush, May 27, 2003\n\nIn keeping with the United States' position as the global leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, President Bush's \nAdministration provides over 50 percent of bilateral international HIV/AIDS assistance. Through various agencies \n\n\n\nand departments, the United States has bilateral programs to combat AIDS in over 100 countries, including the \nfocus countries, and is active through diplomatic and public diplomacy channels in dozens more.\n\nOutside of the Emergency Plan's focus countries, the profile of HIV/AIDS varies widely among nations. Some \ncountries have a high disease burden; others have low incidence of HIV but are witnessing emerging epidemics \nthrough rapid increases in infections; and others have low HIV incidence rates but need to remain vigilant. \nUnfortunately, no country is unaffected by the problem.\n\nThese countries have diverse drivers of HIV/AIDS, including epidemics led and compounded by such factors as \nhigh-risk sexual behavior, injection drug use, unsafe medical practices, gender inequality, prostitution, and poverty. \nAll have challenges in implementing integrated and effective prevention, treatment, and care strategies. Stigma and \ndenial remain widespread challenges, as does the lack of correct and consistent information about HIV/AIDS. \nTesting is underutilized, and appropriate protocols and enabling policies are often lacking. The U.S. Government \nhas collected many \"lessons learned\" over two decades of worldwide HIV/AIDS activity, and it is on the strength of \nbest practices that we embark on an intensified effort in our bilateral HIV/AIDS programs to ensure coordination, \neffectiveness, and accountability.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan offers a fresh opportunity to develop and implement consistent HIV/AIDS policies \nand programs across our bilateral prevention, treatment, and care initiatives, drawing on the U.S. Government's \nstrong field presence and technical expertise. Our bilateral programs worldwide will be an integral part of the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and will be harmonized in policy and management to create the \nmomentum that will truly turn the tide against HIV/AIDS.\n\nBilateral Program Objective:\n\nApply best practices in prevention, treatment, and care, and improve coordination, management, and accountability \nacross all U.S. Government (USG) bilateral HIV/AIDS programs\n\nBilateral Program Strategies:\n\n1. Strengthen quality and capacity of prevention, treatment, and care programs\n\n2. Advance policy initiatives that support effective bilateral programs\n\n3. Strengthen coordination, management, and accountability of programs, and ensure their consistency with the \nprinciples of the Emergency Plan\n\n1. Strengthen quality and capacity of prevention, care, and treatment programs\n\nIntegrated prevention, care, and treatment programs are an established best practice. Integrated programs combat \nstigma, encourage behavior change and testing, and mitigate the consequences of HIV/AIDS. Countries are at \ndifferent stages of HIV/AIDS response, but all HIV/AIDS programs of the U.S. Government should be working \ntoward establishing a continuum of prevention, treatment, and care programs in proportions appropriate for the host \ncountry. Thus, USG efforts will be focused toward increasing the availability of high-quality, sustainable prevention, \ntreatment, and care programs by:\n\nPromoting evidence-based risk elimination and reduction programs\n\nSuccessful strategies, such as the ABC approach and tailored interventions for high-risk groups like injection drug \nusers, are helping to prevent new HIV infections. These strategies will be promoted across all USG bilateral \nHIV/AIDS programs.\n\nPromoting strategies to increase testing\n\nWorldwide, it has been estimated that some 95 percent of HIV-infected individuals do not know their status and thus \ndo not have vital information to protect themselves and others. Testing is a crucial behavior change strategy, and \nnew methods for increasing testing will be explored and promoted, including routine testing in health care settings.\n\nPromoting strategies to combat stigma and denial\n\n\n\nStigma and denial remain primary barriers to addressing HIV/AIDS effectively. Programs will address stigma and \ndenial by increasing the involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS, emphasizing the role of leadership, and \nproviding consistent and correct HIV/AIDS information.\n\nOffering technical assistance for the development of appropriate prevention, treatment, and care protocols.\n\nMany countries lack appropriate prevention, treatment, and care protocols, contributing to ineffective and \ninconsistent program implementation. The U.S. Government will capitalize on its expertise and established best \npractices to promote and assist with the development of comprehensive national prevention, treatment, and care \nprotocols to guide program development across all governmental and nongovernmental sectors.\n\nOffering technical assistance and training of providers\n\nLimited technical capacity is a barrier to increasing and strengthening prevention, treatment, and care interventions, \nand to ensuring compliance with established protocols. The focus of the U.S. Government's HIV/AIDS programs, \nand a necessary tool for ensuring sustainability, is building the capacity of local providers to implement effective \nprograms. USG efforts will have as a priority capacity building of health care workers and CBOs to strengthen the \nquality and expand the reach of effective HIV/AIDS interventions.\n\nIdentifying and developing the capacity of new partners\n\nWorldwide, efforts against HIV/AIDS are amplified through approaches that reach individuals where they live, learn, \nwork, and pray. New partners can expand the reach of programs, fill gaps in service delivery, and contribute \nadditional necessary resources to the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nCoordinating with host governments and a wide range of organizations active in country\n\nTo be fully effective, USG programs should be coordinated with and complementary to existing programs and the \nhost government's national AIDS strategy. The U.S. Government will work closely with the host government, the \nprivate sector, NGOs, FBOs, multilateral institutions, other bilateral donors, and others active in country.\n\n2. Advance policy initiatives that support effective bilateral programs\n\nThe ability of programs and populations to address HIV/AIDS and mitigate its consequences are enormously \nimpacted by policies related to the importation, regulation, and registration of essential medicines and supplies; the \nprovision of basic social services such as health and education; and the allocation of resources. The President's \nEmergency Plan will promote policies reflecting best practices through:\n\nActive diplomacy to advocate for the adoption of supportive policies\n\nThrough the U.S. Chief of Mission and U.S. Government representatives in sectors such as education, health, \ndefense, and trade, the U.S. Government will engage with its leadership counterparts in host countries to advocate \nfor the adoption of supportive HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care policies.\n\nTechnical assistance for policy development\n\nDrawing on its expertise and worldwide experience, the U.S. Government, through its representatives in the field, \nwill provide technical assistance for the development and application of policies supportive of effective action \nagainst HIV/AIDS and its consequences.\n\n3. Strengthen coordination, management, and accountability of programs, and ensure their consistency with the \nprinciples of the Emergency Plan\n\nPresident Bush has placed a strong emphasis on increased accountability for program activities. The USG \nprograms worldwide are currently implemented by a multitude of U.S. Government agencies and departments, each \nwith different management and accountability processes. Programs can be uncoordinated, both with other U.S. \nGovernment agency programs and with host governments and other donors, leaving gaps in service delivery and \nneeds unmet. The lack of uniform accountability methods, including program evaluation methodologies, poses \ndifficulties in comparing program impact and ensuring effective and efficient allocation of resources.\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will:\n\n\n\nCoordinate leadership of U.S. Government bilateral HIV/AIDS programs through the leadership of U.S. Chiefs of \nMission\n\nThe benefits of coordinated leadership, as demonstrated by the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and the U.S. Chief of \nMission-led in-country USG teams in the focus countries, should be applied across USG bilateral programs. \nGovernment agencies will work as a united team under the leadership of the Chief of Mission, ensuring that \nprograms are working toward shared goals.\n\nCoordinate with host governments and other donors to eliminate duplication and ensure that needs are met\n\nCoordination with host governments and donors will be strengthened. This will allow for more effective \ncommunication and evaluation of country-specific needs and circumstances, facilitate the effective and efficient use \nof funds, and determine and fill gaps in service provision.\n\nImplement uniform standards for strategic information and evaluation\n\nAs a unified team implementing a coordinated country plan, all U.S. Government agency activities will be evaluated \non their progress toward meeting established goals according to shared indicators that will facilitate the comparison \nof programs.\n\nHold U.S. Government programs accountable for results\n\nU.S. Government programs will be funded according to their ability to indicate evidence-based success against \nspecified goals. Improved accountability, in addition to uniform evaluation standards, will facilitate the identification \nof successful programs for scale-up and poorly performing programs for elimination.\n\nAssist countries in developing their own strategic plans\n\nFollowing from the coordination of leadership described above, U.S. Government departments and agencies will \nwork with host-country governments to develop coordinated country plans that will identify opportunities to \ncapitalize on the strengths of individual USG agencies and eliminate duplication in program services.\n\nVIII. STRENGTHENING MULTILATERAL ACTIONS\n\n        \"The United States is committed to working with other nations to\n\n        reduce suffering and to spam lives. And working together is the\n\n        key. Only through sustained and focused international cooperation\n\n        can we address problems so grave and suffering so great.\"\n\n        President George W. Bush, May 11, 2001\n\nThe crisis of global AIDS is too great for any one entity to solve. Turning the tide will require a sustained \ncollaborative effort from a multitude of international, national, and local organizations leveraging their comparative \nstrengths. Not only are there extraordinary resource needs, but the diverse drivers and consequences of the \ndisease, and its many complicated interactions with a variety of other social, political, and economic circumstances, \ndemand an equal number of diverse actors with varied expertise.\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan makes an unprecedented commitment of resources and focuses funds on the \nU.S. Government's strengths in providing technical assistance, training, research, and material resources to \ndramatically increase health care infrastructure and capacity to address HIV/AIDS effectively, including providing \ntreatment. The Emergency Plan recognizes, however, that strengthened health care systems are but one powerful \ntool in combating HIV/AIDS. Many other essential requirements, including such basic needs as clean water and \nadequate nutrition, present barriers to a successful HIV/AIDS response. Conflict, famine, and gender inequality all \nmake contributions to the spread of HIV and the devastation of AIDS, and must be addressed.\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan commits a significant proportion of its resources to the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in recognition of the fact that the Fund is a promising global force in the fight \nagainst AIDS and offers important opportunities to address needs complementary to other elements of this strategy. \n\n\n\nOther multilateral institutions and international organizations, such as UNAIDS and its \"Three Ones\" principles, \nWHO and its \"3 by 5\" initiative, the World Bank, and the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, have also provided essential global leadership, expertise, and resources, particularly in the areas of \nadvocacy, government and civil society collaboration, HIV/AIDS and economic development, and health sector \nresponse (including HIV/AIDS surveillance, prevention, treatment, and care). Organizations such as the World Food \nProgram (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), \nthe International Labor Organization (ILO), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Committee of the \nRed Cross (ICRC) have HIV/AIDS programs focused on specific needs or populations, such as food security, \nmothers and children, workplace issues, refugees, migrant workers, and youth.\n\nThe contributions of these multilateral institutions and international organizations working with great dedication to \ncombat HIV/AIDS provide a vital opportunity for a comprehensive response. The U.S. Government will strengthen \nits relationships with multilateral institutions and international organizations to amplify global action against \nHIV/AIDS by encouraging coordination to fill gaps in current activities and ensure efficient use of funds. Effective \ncollaboration, however, requires addressing several of the challenges currently facing the international community \nin its fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nDuplication of program efforts and an uncoordinated response, especially in the most afflicted nations where so \nmany have initiated programs, must be avoided. Harmonized proposal, surveillance, reporting, and accountability \nrequirements will avoid placing additional burdens on governments already weighed down by the disease burdens \nof HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. As an international community, donors should commit to promoting best \npractices and evidence-based interventions and adhere to high standards for resource allocation and management. \nAt the same time, recognizing that HIV/AIDS is a global emergency, donors should ensure that funds are quickly \ndispersed to organizations effectively serving those in need, with an eye to building local capacity for a sustainable \nlong-term response.\n\nThe U.S. Government will use the full range of diplomatic tools to engage international organizations as partners in \nthe fight against HIV/AIDS. Under President Bush's Emergency Plan, efforts will be made to strengthen U.S. \nparticipation on governing boards and to consult closely and often with both the leadership and working levels of the \nmultilateral and other international organizations working on HIV/AIDS. Across the world, the United States will \ncoordinate programmatic and diplomatic efforts at the local level in order to enhance the effect of global \ncontributions. Together with the strength of USG bilateral programs, effective multilateral engagement and action \nwill win the war on AIDS.\n\nMultilateral Objective:\n\nEnsure a comprehensive and amplified response to global HIV/AIDS through leadership, engagement, and \ncoordination with multilateral institutions and international organizations\n\nMultilateral Strategies:\n\n1. Coordinating programs to capitalize on the comparative advantage offered by each multilateral organization, \nincluding targeting multilateral strengths to unique challenges\n\n2. Working to harmonize proposal, reporting, and strategic information systems across all multilateral and \ninternational organizations\n\n3. Promoting evidence-based policies and sound management strategies\n\n4. Encouraging expanded partnerships that build local capacity\n\n1. Coordinating programs to capitalize on the comparative advantage offered by each multilateral organization, \nincluding targeting multilateral strengths to unique challenges\n\nTrue progress against HIV/AIDS will require a comprehensive response that addresses the diverse drivers and \nconsequences of disease. The United States will focus its interventions on health care and human services \napproaches to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care that capitalize on its expertise in technical assistance, \ntraining, and research. Many multilateral organizations have vital expertise in specific areas. For instance, WHO \n\n\n\naddresses the health sector to HIV/AIDS and works closely with health ministries. The ILO focuses on HIV/AIDS in \nthe workplace and the rights of workers living with HIV/AIDS, while the WFP focuses on food security and \nnutritional needs. ICRC and UNHCR are able to reach refugees and displaced persons, while many other \norganizations focus on improving the status of women. Each of these interventions, and those from other agencies \nboth in and out of the U.N. system, is important to a comprehensive and effective response to global HIV/AIDS, and \ncontributions are amplified when they are coordinated.\n\nThe U.S. Government will strongly encourage coordination to fill gaps by:\n\n     *  Engaging, through the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, the leadership\n\n        of multilateral and international organizations to identify and\n\n        then complement comparative strengths;\n\n     *  Encouraging the development of one in-country structure that can\n\n        facilitate coordination between donors, host governments, people\n\n        living with HIV/AIDS, and NGOs; and\n\n     *  Ensuring that U.S. missions, through their networks of public\n\n        affairs, refugee, economic, health, and development assistance\n\n        officers and other specialists, are working with their in-country\n\n        counterparts in the field.\n\n2. Working to harmonize proposal, reporting, and strategic information systems across all multilateral and \ninternational organizations\n\nHarmonization of proposal, reporting, surveillance, management, and evaluation procedures across all multilateral \nand international organizations is a key to the success of global HIV/AIDS efforts. Harmonized procedures both \nensure comparability of different programs across countries and decrease the burden on host organizations and \ngovernments. The U.S.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: SPECIAL FOCUS: The Global Fund]\n\nSidebar 9: SPECIAL FOCUS: The Global Fund \n\nGovernment will actively participate in harmonization efforts with WHO, UNAIDS, the Global Fund, and other \nmultilateral organizations, through the participation of U.S. Government representatives to each of these bodies. \nHarmonizing multilateral efforts includes engaging all the partners within a given organization to follow through on \nagreed commitments. The United States will use its bilateral relationships to further and strengthen the U.S.-\nsupported goals of multilateral organizations. Activities include:\n\n     *  Actively working to ensure that all resolutions and commitments\n\n        agreed to in the multilateral area are compatible with our\n\n        bilateral policies;\n\n     *  Using our bilateral, relationships to come up with creative ways to\n\n        work together to further those goals agreed upon within our common\n\n        organizations; and\n\n     *  Working to adopt the same monitoring and evaluation, procurement,\n\n        and reporting standards to ease the work of recipients.\n\n3. Promoting evidence-based policies and sound management strategies\n\n\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan recognizes that the nature of the HIV/AIDS crisis urges immediate action, yet \ninterventions must reflect sound science and management. The large influx of resources for combating global \nHIV/AIDS from both bilateral and multilateral donors makes best practices and accountability for use of those funds \neven more important, particularly to sustain public support for the AIDS effort. The U.S. Government will strive to \nensure accountability for its contributions, both through multilateral and bilateral efforts, and will encourage partners \nto do the same.\n\nTo achieve maximum impact against the disease, funds must be targeted to effective interventions. Two decades \nof HIV/AIDS work have revealed an evidence base on which to begin building effective programs. The United \nStates will work closely with technical organizations such as WHO to determine the best range of options for \ntreatment, prevention, and care, and will promote the adoption of such established best practices across all areas \nof multilateral action. Specifically, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will:\n\n     *  Actively work with the Global Fund Secretariat, through the U.S.\n\n        Executive Director's Office at the World Bank and elsewhere, to\n\n        ensure a focus on results-based management of HIV/AIDS projects;\n\n     *  Use the \"parallel project review\" process mandated by Congress to\n\n        lead an internal USG review to ensure that all proposals\n\n        recommended to the Global Fund Board for approval are technically\n\n        and developmentally sound, demonstrate that added resources will\n\n        bring results, and meet high programmatic and financial\n\n        accountability standards;\n\n     *  Use the programmatic expertise of the Department of Health and\n\n        Human Services and policy experts at the Department of State, both\n\n        in the United States and in countries in which the U.S. Government\n\n        has HIV/AIDS program presence and expertise, to evaluate proposals\n\n        and their impact potential on the ground;\n\n     *  Provide guidance to U.S. Government representatives to multilateral\n\n        organizations on the technical efficacy, need, and management\n\n        strategies of proposed programming; and\n\n     *  Collaborate with other donors, including the Global Fund\n\n        Secretariat, to encourage other nations to undertake a similarly\n\n        detailed review in countries where they have expertise to ensure\n\n        the best possible outcome for recommended projects.\n\n4. Encouraging expanded partnerships that build local capacity\n\nThe U.S. Government will encourage multilateral organizations to work through local partners and existing \nmechanisms within the host country's national strategy wherever possible, and, where this is not possible, to make \nbuilding local capacity a strong priority. Multilateral organizations that serve as in-country implementing partners \nwill also be encouraged to have phase-out goals for a country's \"graduation\" from the need to rely on outside \nsources for management or implementation of programs.\n\nGovernments, NGOs, and the private sector all have a role to play in this effort. The U.S. Government will work \nboth within multilateral organizations and through embassies to identify and support NGO and private sector \n\n\n\nproviders to participate in partnerships and build their capacity to manage programs at the local level. The U.S. \nGovernment will:\n\n     *  Set an example in capacity building by including \"graduation\"\n\n        language in our contracts for bilateral grants with all non-local\n\n        organizations;\n\n     *  Continue to support the Global Fund's commitment to including\n\n        similar \"exit strategies\" in their grant agreements with UNDP and\n\n        other major multilaterals serving as temporary principal recipients\n\n        and will work to ensure this goal is achieved; and\n\n     *  Facilitate the creation of co-investment strategies with private\n\n        sector partners and/or local government partners to deliver\n\n        services that will serve as models for the rest of the world.\n\nIX. IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT\n\n        \"As Global AIDS Coordinator...he will coordinate all of our\n\n        international HIV/AIDS activities for all of our government\n\n        departments and agencies. He will oversee all resources of this\n\n        program. And he will work with the faith-based and community groups\n\n        to get the job done. He will report regularly to Congress on the\n\n        progress and effectiveness of our efforts,\"\n\n        President George W. Bush, July 2, 2003\n\nMeeting the challenge of the global AIDS crisis is a monumental task that will require--along with strong leadership \nand vision--robust and flexible administrative structures. This section describes the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS \nCoordinator's organization and implementation strategy for President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\n\nThe implementation strategy of President Bush's Emergency Plan is designed to meet the goals he set in his \nhistoric State of the Union message of 2003. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's response must be rapid, \neffective, and evidence- based, and make efficient and focused use of all relevant government capabilities through \ncoordination, collaboration, and cooperation across U.S. Government agencies. It must also reflect administration \npolicy and statute; respond to the diverse needs of the various communities around the world in which the U.S. \nGovernment works; and account for progress toward achieving the President's goals.\n\nAdditionally, as implementation moves forward, a growing number of public and private entities will become active \npartners in the United States' fight against global AIDS. This is, in fact, a focus of this initiative--to bring the breadth \nand depth of American public and private talent to the fore to meet the challenge of global AIDS. Coordination of \nthese activities will pose an ever-increasing challenge and will be taken into account as the Emergency Plan is \nimplemented.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will lead an integrated U.S. Government global HIV/AIDS effort; \nprovide a rallying point for private sector, FBO, and NGO efforts; and make necessary decisions and take actions to \nensure that policies are harmonious, programs synergistic, and operations efficient and effective. An overarching \nobjective is to create a single coordinated U.S. Government global AIDS response. The U.S. Global AIDS \nCoordinator will lead a unified global projection of U.S. resources and talent to turn the tide against HIV/AIDS.\n\nIt is important that a consistent philosophy permeate all activities overseen by the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. \nThe strategic guidance outlined at the beginning of this document applies to all U.S. bilateral activities. Across all \n\n\n\nprograms, implementation efforts will follow the President's vision for the Emergency Plan. They will focus on the \nurgency of response and the desire to seek new approaches and foster bold leadership. Reliance on evidence-\nbased approaches and accountability, and the recognition that planning and implementation must be based on local \nconditions and follow the lead of local government, will inform program implementation. Bilateral programs outside \nof the focus countries will also experience dynamic improvements in their programs and activities as they will \nspecifically benefit from strengthened management, coordination, and best practices identified through focus \ncountry activities.\n\nThe following sections describe broad categories of implementation and management activities that will drive \nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan.\n\nCoordination\n\nThe position of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator was specifically mandated to provide coordination and oversight \nacross all U.S. international HIV/AIDS activities, including those run by specific U.S. agencies or through \nmultilateral organizations. Coordination with other stakeholders, including national governments and \nnongovernmental service providers, is key to the amplified response expected under President Bush's Emergency \nPlan. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is thus responsible for both internal and external coordination of HIV/AIDS \nactivities.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator: A New Leadership Model]\n\nSidebar 10: The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator: A New Leadership Model \n\nInternal Coordination. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will undertake an ongoing planning, policy \ndevelopment, and program implementation process that involves all relevant U.S. Government departments and \nagencies and draws on the technical strengths of central and in-country staff. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's \noffice will conduct regular intergovernmental program and policy meetings and will support collaborative planning, \nimplementation, and objective review processes that will involve bringing in-country staff to headquarters for short-\nterm technical exchanges.\n\nCountry-specific response teams composed of agency and U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator staff have been \norganized for the focus countries. These teams provide each U.S. Mission with a consistent, competent, and \ninformed point of contact in the central office and ensure that central office staff are aware of specific issues, \nsituations, and factors that influence implementation in the field.\n\nAt the same time, staff will coordinate with U.S. Government agencies or offices that are not specifically involved in \nHIV/AIDS efforts but promote initiatives supportive of the fight against HIV/AIDS in important additional areas, such \nas food and other development assistance programs, research activities, and faith-based initiatives.\n\nExternal Coordination. Coordination with local policies, programs, and strategic plans is crucial to the sustainability \nof programs and efficient use of resources. Coordination with other donors and contributors is also crucial to \ncombating HIV/AIDS. In order to work smoothly in the target countries, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will task \nfield offices to ensure that donors with significant equities are included in the local planning process. On the \nmultilateral level, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will liaise with representatives in multilateral institutions to \navoid conflicts and duplication of efforts. Again, coordination with multilateral institutions and international \norganizations is intended to mobilize a comprehensive response to global HIV/AIDS that capitalizes on the \nexpertise of various groups.\n\nIt is also important that the Coordinator learn from the experiences of others working in this arena. Close proactive \nliaison with private sector organizations, businesses, and faith-based and other organizations involved in global \nHIV/AIDS will help to support an environment that strengthens and fosters innovation.\n\nCountry Planning\n\nAt the core of the implementation strategy is a robust ongoing in-country planning effort. This will begin in the focus \ncountries where the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will ask each Chief of Mission to undertake a strategic planning \nprocess to develop a five-year plan for strengthening the quality, availability, and sustainability of treatment, \n\n\n\nprevention, and care services. The planning process will include all relevant USG entities as well as the host-\ncountry government, the NGO sector, people living with AIDS, other bilateral and multilateral donors, and additional \nstakeholders. The plan will identify relevant U.S. Government agencies, existing resources, needs, gaps, partners, \nprograms, objectives, performance measures, staffing, and technical assistance requirements. Coordination will \nthus be improved and resources best matched to local needs and conditions.\n\nThe in-country strategic planning process is critical to the success of the Emergency Plan and will be strongly \nsupported by technical assistance from the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and other federal agencies. \nPlans will be submitted to the Coordinator for review, in consultation with field offices, technical experts, and \nagency officials. Final approval by the Coordinator will ensure consistency with congressional intent, administration \npolicy, and program objectives.\n\nPlanning for services is critical in every U.S. mission and for every country, be it a focus country or not. Increasing \nattention will be directed to non-focus countries in the months and years ahead. Staff in non-focus countries will \nwork with local governments to develop national strategic plans for prevention, treatment, and care. Best practices \nin the focus countries will be emphasized and technical assistance from USG staff and relevant experts in focus \ncountries will be facilitated by the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Limitation on the Use of Funds]\n\nSidebar 11: Limitation on the Use of Funds \n\nAllocation of Funding\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan relies on a variety of funding allocation mechanisms in order to maximize \nflexibility and encourage innovation while responding to specific country needs.\n\nAllocations by Country. Funding levels for focus countries will be allocated on the basis of five-year strategic plans, \nand funds will be released upon approval of annual country operational plans by the U.S. Global AIDS \nCoordinator. The Coordinator will not predetermine annual funding levels agency by agency but will instead \nconsult with the agencies and Chiefs of Mission to determine the optimal mix of U.S. Government agency support \nappropriate for local conditions, capabilities, and needs. This process will leverage the comparative advantages of \nvarious USG organizations, ensure coordination, and stimulate innovation. An annual review will be conducted for \nother ongoing HIV/AIDS bilateral programs.\n\nCentral Funding Mechanisms. Some resources will be disbursed through central office initiatives. Some NGOs \nhave existing capacity to respond quickly and effectively in more than one country, making it. more efficient to fund \nmultiple country projects. In other cases, the U.S. Government will seek out organizations that can provide \ntechnical assistance and support for activities such as professional training or twinning programs on a regional \nbasis. In both cases, these organizations will be included in local strategic plans and subject to approval by the \nChiefs of Mission in the targeted countries so that, if performance is acceptable, they will receive ongoing support \nthrough field mechanisms. This process will ensure efficiency as well as policy consistency and coherency.\n\nIn the case of central funding mechanisms, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will assign implementation \nresponsibility to the central office of a U.S. Government agency. In consultation with the Office of the U.S. Global \nAIDS Coordinator, the agency will solicit proposals, conduct reviews, and award grants, contracts, or cooperative \nagreements through a transparent competitive process.\n\nEvidence-Based Allocations. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's funding decisions will be evidence-based. A \nstrong monitoring and evaluation function will be established (see chapter X) with the goal of gathering strategic \ninformation necessary to allocate resources for maximum impact and ensure accountability to American taxpayers \nand their congressional representatives. Allocations of funds among and within the focus countries will be based \nupon performance in reaching treatment, prevention, and care targets. These targets will be derived from the \"2-7-\n10\" goals set by President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union address--2 million people in treatment, 7 million \ninfections prevented, and 10 million people provided with care.\n\nFiscal Controls\n\n\n\nCongress has entrusted the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator with unprecedented resources to fight global HIV/AIDS. \nUtilizing existing capabilities and processes within U.S. Government agencies, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator \nhas established mechanisms to track funds accurately and control disbursements so that resources will be \ncorrectly directed to their intended use and will be deployed rapidly. Careful attention will be paid to distinguish \nobligations from expenditures in order to make realistic budget projections to fund services for those in need as \naggressively as possible.\n\nCommunications/Liaison\n\nTransparency in implementation is critical. Over half of all international assistance donated to fight global HIV/AIDS \ncomes from U.S. taxpayers, and they, as well as the people and communities being served, should be able to \nreadily understand how funds are allocated, distributed, and used; what impact they are having; and who is \nbenefiting from them.\n\n[The following sidebar appears: Allocation of Funds]\n\nSidebar 12: Allocation of Funds \n\nCommunication is therefore another key element of implementation. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will ensure \nthat the public is given timely, accurate, and complete information regarding the President's Emergency Plan for \nAIDS Relief. A variety of mechanisms, including Web technology, reports to Congress, and media outreach will \nserve this purpose.\n\nOffice of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator\n\nWith the authority to act internationally, to transfer and allocate funding to executive branch agencies, and to \ncontract with NGOs, including faith- and community-based programs, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator has been \ngiven the necessary tools to lead a unified, coordinated U.S. Government global AIDS response. As champion of \nthe vision and strategic direction of the President's Emergency Plan, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will also \ndetermine resource allocation and program effectiveness.\n\nIn broad terms, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will be organized to provide strategic and policy \ndirection as well as technical and program management to oversee global HIV/AIDS program activities. In addition, \nthe Office of the Coordinator will provide communications, administrative, and diplomatic resources for managing \nbilateral and multilateral activities. Recognizing that the implementation of the Emergency Plan will be carried out \nlargely by other departments and agencies (centrally and in the field), the Office will be a small organization \nfocused on leadership, coordination, learning, and oversight, and will strive to remain flexible and innovative in its \napproaches.\n\nFunctions of the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator\n\nThe Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator is organized and will be staffed to lead the implementation of President \nBush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The Office is organized into units of specialized function as follows:\n\n     *  The Leadership of the Office is responsible for overseeing all\n\n        activities and ensuring that the programs and activities of the\n\n        Emergency Plan are accountable to the President and the Congress.\n\n     *  The Program Services unit is responsible for development and\n\n        compliance monitoring of implementation plans for each of the\n\n        Emergency Plan's focus countries. This unit will also serve as a\n\n        technical and clinical support resource for the focus countries and\n\n        all other activities conducted by the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator.\n\n        It will also serve as a technical resource for human capacity\n\n\n\n        development activities and will develop, implement, and monitor\n\n        programs that respond to training needs.\n\n     *  The Strategic Information and Evaluation unit will be\n\n        responsible for gathering the information necessary to ensure that\n\n        Emergency Plan goals are reached and that those goals have the\n\n        expected impact. This unit will work with the international\n\n        community to harmonize strategic information collection and will\n\n        also serve as a liaison to the research community as well as the\n\n        research and information components of implementing agencies.\n\n     *  The Management Services unit will provide operational support\n\n        to the Office and will track the disbursement of program funds.\n\n     *  The Diplomatic Liaison unit is responsible for strategic\n\n        planning and activities to foster leadership and develop a\n\n        coordinated international response on HIV/AIDS by working with\n\n        international institutions, foreign governments, NGOs, and others.\n\n     *  The Government and Public Liaison unit will have the\n\n        responsibilities of responding to congressional requests for data\n\n        and information and communicating policy to Congress. It will\n\n        prepare congressional reports and compliance documents. It serves\n\n        as the technical resource for the U. S. Global AIDS Coordinator on\n\n        budget and appropriations issues. The unit is also responsible for\n\n        developing the annual budget and will serve as the liaison to the\n\n        White House and to administration departments and agencies and\n\n        their budget offices.\n\n     *  The Public Affairs and Communications unit will plan and\n\n        implement domestic and foreign communications in support of\n\n        Emergency Plan activities and will conduct outreach activities to\n\n        promote involvement of various public and private organizations\n\n        that could be beneficial in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nX. SUPPORTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS\n\n        \"It's more than money we bring, we bring expertise and compassion\n\n        and love and the desire to develop a comprehensive system...\"\n\n        President George W. Bush, April 29, 2003\n\nInterventions that support implementation of the President Bush's Emergency Plan will include an effective and \naccountable supply chain; a strong research program to provide the evidence base necessary to guide policies and \nprograms, including a coordinated strategic information system; and enhanced public-private partnerships.\n\n\n\nSupply chain management is critical to ensure the delivery of essential drugs, supplies, and equipment that make \nHIV/AIDS programs possible. Under the Emergency Plan, attention will be focused on supporting a secure and \nsustainable supply chain management system that is reliable and coordinated with complementary programs, such \nas donated ARV drug programs. Efforts will also be targeted toward reducing and eliminating diversion, \ncounterfeiting, and the sale of HIV/AIDS products and supplies on the black market.\n\nA robust evidence base is needed to direct the Emergency Plan's treatment, prevention, and care programs. A \nstrong research program will both provide new knowledge (e.g., more effective ARV therapy or discovery of \neffective prevention methodologies) as well as give direction to policy and program decisions (operational studies). \nMoreover, by strengthening linkages between the research community and the Emergency Plan, implementation \nsuccesses and failures can inform future research agendas. A second set of evidence will be collected through a \nstrategic information system that will track programs to ensure that, they are meeting targets (monitoring) and that \nactivities have measurable impact (evaluation). Best practices for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and care will be \nidentified through both of these processes.\n\nPublic-private partnerships will mobilize private sector resources to build sustainable systems of HIV/AIDS \ntreatment, prevention, and care. The comparative advantages of these partnerships will be maximized to \ncomplement the services provided by the public and NGO/FBO sectors.\n\n1. Supply Chain Management\n\nComprehensive HIV/AIDS programs require a large number of products. Effective supply management is critical to \nthe delivery of these products. To ensure sustainability of HIV/AIDS programs, essential supply chain management \npersonnel will be trained and health logistics systems strengthened. Efforts will need to be taken to minimize drug \ndiversion, counterfeiting, and waste, with a special focus on ARVs, given the high cost of these drugs and the risk of \ndrug resistance if they are administered inappropriately. Opioids also need similar strong management to avoid \ndiversion and misuse. President Bush's Emergency Plan will coordinate with other donors so that supply chain \nsynergies are maximized and gaps in distribution systems minimized.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry estimates the cost of distribution from manufacturer to retailer to be \nabout 20 to 25 percent of the drug's retail cost. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator anticipates investing \na comparable percentage of product costs for supply chain management.\n\nSupply Chain Management Objective:\n\nCreate, enhance, and promote an uninterrupted supply of high-quality, low-cost products that flow through an \naccountable system\n\nSupply Chain Management Strategies:\n\n1. Rapidly scale up supply chain management to support HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and care\n\n2. Build capacity for long-term sustainable procurement and distribution\n\n3. Ensure quality control of drugs, test kits, and other supplies\n\n4. Focus on intellectual property law at international and national levels\n\n1. Rapidly scale up supply chain management to support HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention and care\n\nThe development and implementation of logistics systems to manage the increased volume of products and \nsupplies for the full continuum of care will require both short- and long-term strategies. The focus of all strategies \nwill be on procuring and delivering a continuous and secure supply of high-quality products to patients who need \nthem at all levels of the health system. In the short term, the approach will require a combination of outsourcing \nsome logistics functions to the private sector, rapidly building a vertical distribution and information management \nsystem with external technical assistance, and improving the storage conditions, distribution networks, and human \ncapacity skills at sites providing HIV care and treatment.\n\n\n\nIn most countries, the sharp increase in the volume of products provided through President Bush's Emergency \nPlan, and other new sources such as the Global Fund, will probably challenge existing national supply systems. To \nensure product supply and quality, the Emergency Plan will explore options to enhance the immediate \nperformance of national logistics systems, including:\n\n     *  Centralizing or pooling procurement mechanisms at global or\n\n        regional levels;\n\n     *  Outsourcing transportation to secure courier services or purchases\n\n        of dedicated vehicles for the delivery of ARVs, other drugs, and\n\n        other essential products (e.g., palliative care supplies);\n\n     *  Designing user-friendly, timely, and accurate methods of logistics\n\n        data capture, collection, analysis, and feedback for resupply and\n\n        forecasting;\n\n     *  Selecting products and improving packaging to support patient\n\n        adherence;\n\n     *  Providing skilled individuals to perform logistics management\n\n        functions; and\n\n     *  Improving secure storage space and inventory management systems.\n\nKey to success will be the seamless collaboration between the supply chain managers and program service \nmanagers. Overall program impact will be ensured through coordination of patient enrollment, product availability, \nand service capacity. Collaboration with other donors and stakeholders is also imperative. For example, a logistics \nsystem that manages products procured under the Emergency Plan may be able to take on management of similar \nproducts funded through other sources, such as the Global Fund or the World Bank's Multi-Country HIV/AIDS \nProgram for Africa (MAP), in addition to existing donor basket funds and direct product donations. President Bush's \nEmergency Plan will work to facilitate the development of national coordinating bodies to manage donor financial \nand product/supply commitments, develop medium-term procurement plans, and track actual funds and products \nreceived. The coordinating body will promote a synergistic approach to donor inputs to avoid duplication of \ninvestment and waste of resources.\n\n2. Build capacity for long-term sustainable procurement and distribution\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will build on lessons learned through other public health programs, such as \nthose that manage essential drug, immunization, family planning, and child survival initiatives. To improve program \neffectiveness, procurement and supply management considerations will be built into program design and \nimplementation. The Emergency Plan will provide technical assistance and training to strengthen procurement and \ndistribution systems in the areas of:\n\n     *  Product selection, and\n\n     *  Distribution.\n\nProduct selection\n\nProducts identified for procurement must be compatible with national essential drug lists, testing policies, treatment \nprotocols, and product registration procedures. The development of sate and effective fixed-dose combination \n(FDC) antiretroviral medications is a goal the Administration supports, and to that end the U.S. Government is \ncosponsoring, with WHO, UNAIDS, and the Southern Africa Development Community, an international scientific \nconference in the spring of 2004 to produce an international consensus document that will set out principles that \nneed to be taken into account when considering FDC drug products. The document will contain definitions of terms \nand set out principles that relate to the safety, quality, effectiveness, and ongoing quality assurance for these \nproducts. It will deal with such issues as bioequivalence, bioavailability, and stability, as well as how drug \n\n\n\nregulatory authorities should approach reviews of these products. The document will not issue guidelines or \nregulatory guidance, nor will it deal with procurement, clinical issues, blister packs, or compliance--only technical \nand scientific issues.\n\nDistribution\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will address in-country distribution by focusing on building local capacity to \nnegotiate, purchase, manage, and supply goods. This will be accomplished by improving coordination among \ndonors, developing and applying logistics management information systems, building the local capacity of human \nresources, strengthening customs processes, improving storage facilities and practices, enhancing transportation \nsystems, and preventing diversion of products into commercial or black markets.\n\n3. Ensure quality control of drugs, test kits, and other supplies\n\nUnder the Emergency Plan, products of the highest quality will be purchased at the lowest price. Ensuring high \nquality is absolutely essential for HIV/AIDS drugs, test kits, and other supplies. Therefore, products will be procured \nfrom reliable manufacturers to ensure product safety and efficacy. The Emergency Plan will enhance in-country \ncapacity to perform quality-testing procedures and, where appropriate, will support the development of regional \ntesting facilities to ensure product, quality.\n\n4. Focus on intellectual property law at international and national levels\n\nThrough President Bush's Emergency Plan, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is eager to work with \nall parties who are interested in contributing to this important effort to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic by \nensuring that high-quality affordable drugs are available to those in need of them.\n\nWithin this context, Emergency Plan funds used to purchase products will be directed to obtaining high-quality \ngoods at the lowest possible price. This could mean bioequivalent versions of branded ARV and other medications. \nVoluntary differential pricing already exists, and there is no evidence that the market is not working or that \ncompanies are preparing to rescind their preferential pricing offers for poor countries. Major research-based \ncompanies are responding to the evolution of a market in the developing world to bid competitively, even beating \nper-patient generic prices in some markets in the developing world, and these companies are encouraged to \ncompete for tenders that will use Emergency Plan funds. Brand-name companies have also done an exemplary \njob of donating their products to roll out treatment and care for patients with HIV/AIDS. Public-private partnerships \n(like the Merck/Gates Foundation/Harvard collaboration in Botswana or the Global Alliance for Vaccines and \nImmunization) are providing drugs and vaccines at no or very low cost in many places in the developing world. \nVoluntary out-licensing proposals to encourage market competition in the production of Pharmaceuticals, such as \nPharmacia's arrangement with the International Dispensary Association in the Netherlands for manufacturing one of \nits AIDS drugs in the developing world, are potential models as well.\n\nGrantees will be expected to follow national laws in the countries in which they will be operating and to respect \napplicable international obligations regarding intellectual property. All procurement under the Emergency Plan will \nhave to fit within the parameters of existing federal and international law for the protection of intellectual property \nrights.\n\nThere is a need for balance between the needs of poor countries without the resources to produce or pay for \ncutting-edge pharmaceuticals and the need to ensure that the patent rights system, which provides the incentives \nfor continued development and creation of new lifesaving and life-extending drugs, is promoted. Because a high \npercentage of all new medicines are invented in the United States, the new medicines that will solve the health \nproblems both of today and tomorrow will likely come from U.S. companies. In this regard, intellectual property \nrights are not the problem but a part of the solution--they provide the incentive for innovation in creating new \nmedicines, including vaccines, and private enterprises are the principal entities that bring new health technologies \nto market.\n\nThe United States supports the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on August \n30, 2003, regarding the implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) and Public Health. This decision represents an expeditious \n\n\n\nsolution to the difficulties that developing-country WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in \nthe pharmaceutical sector could face in making effective use of the flexibilities contained in the TRIPS Agreement.\n\nThe United States expects that all countries will cooperate to ensure that the drugs and active ingredients \nproduced under the terms of the Paragraph 6 solution--as well as other drugs sold or donated in developing \ncountries--are not diverted from countries in need to wealthier markets. There is also insufficient government action \nin many developing countries to prevent the marketing, sale, and use of substandard and counterfeit drugs, some of \nwhich find their way back to developed markets. In the last year, police and drug regulators have discovered crime \nrings that were diverting donated or reduced-price AIDS drugs from developing nations and selling them in Europe. \nEuropean nations also are experiencing growing problems with counterfeit or substandard medicines imported from \nAfrica and Asia, and counterfeit AIDS medications have begun to circulate in Africa as well.\n\nTariffs and duties on pharmaceuticals pose another problem. These are barriers that can be important elements in \nincreasing the cost of drugs in developing countries and work at cross-purposes with initiatives that NGOs, \ngovernments, and industry are undertaking to improve access to medicines.\n\n2. Evidence-Based Programs\n\nPolicy and program decisions for the President's Emergency Plan will be evidence-based. The evidence needed \nincludes:\n\n     *  Research: The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's Office will\n\n        bring together publicly and privately supported projects to inform\n\n        the evidence base of President Bush's Emergency Plan; will work to\n\n        ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards in research;\n\n        and will communicate scientific findings in transparent and useful\n\n        ways.\n\n     *  Strategic information: Strategic information systems will\n\n        address questions such as: \"Are federal agencies and partners\n\n        meeting targets?\" and \"What is the impact of actions taken?\"\n\nResearch\n\nResearch important to the Emergency Plan can be broadly divided into two parts: (1) research to produce new \nknowledge, and (2) targeted research to support the programs and policies of the initiative.\n\nBasic, clinical, social science, translational, and operational clinical research will be supported through the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health (HHS/NIH) and will follow the HHS/NIH \nOffice of AIDS Research (OAR) annual strategic plan for HIV/AIDS research as described in appendix H. The \nHHS/NIH annual AIDS research strategic plan addresses the following research areas: natural history and \nepidemiology, etiology and pathogenesis, therapeutics, vaccines, behavioral modification research, microbicides, \nHIV prevention, women and girls, training and infrastructure, and information dissemination, as well as a component \ndevoted to international AIDS research. Similarly, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will \ncontinue to support applied and operational research as well as focused activities on vaccines and microbicides, as \ndescribed in appendix I. Although HHS and USAID research activities will generally not be funded through the \nEmergency Plan, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will work closely with both HHS and USAID leadership to \nmake sure that goals and needs of the Emergency Plan are supported by these research priorities. These \ncollaborative efforts will also work to rapidly translate research into practice in the initiative's activities.\n\nThe many programs and activities undertaken to reach the goals of the President's Emergency Plan will require a \ncertain amount of targeted evaluation and research that addresses special circumstances in the diverse settings of \nthe focus countries. New approaches to prevention, treatment, and care must be rigorously analyzed as to their \nrelative merit and effectiveness. Clinical decision-making will require studies to determine optimal treatment in \ndiverse settings and conditions. While some of these studies will fall under the mandate of HHS or other \n\n\n\ndepartments, others may not. In these cases, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, in consultation with \nHHS, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Defense, and other partners and interested \nparties, may need to fund a program of special studies. The agenda for these special studies includes developing \nclinical guidelines, addressing optimal program and policy formulation, seeking solutions to barriers to care, and \nconducting other studies to assist programs in meeting the goals of the President's Emergency Plan.\n\nFinally, global research capacity is a key component of sophisticated health systems development. The NIH \nresearch agenda, by developing research capacity in the focus countries and around the world, will enhance \nclinical care in those countries. At the pinnacle of health systems networks are research institutions that will be able \nto work with NIH and other international research organizations. This research capacity will, in turn, help support, \nachievement of national HIV/AIDS strategies as well as programmatic efforts to meet the goals of President Bush's \nEmergency Plan.\n\nStrategic Information\n\nStrategic information for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is the systematic collection, analysis, and \ndissemination of information about reaching the Emergency Plan's objectives, as well as the related programmatic \nactivities funded to reach these goals. It includes surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation of HIV programs \nsupported by the U.S. Government and is essential to meet legislated goals and program objectives and to inform \nthe public and their representatives in Congress.\n\nWe plan, through strategic information, to:\n\n     *  Provide assistance to countries in the collection of core\n\n        indicators (some of which rely on facility-based information) for\n\n        the timely production of monitoring and evaluation reports based on\n\n        these data. Core indicators will include outcome indicators\n\n        addressing the Emergency Plan's \"2-7-10\" goals of 2 million people\n\n        treated, 7 million infections prevented, and 10 million persons\n\n        provided with care. Program progress indicators include numbers of\n\n        facilities supported, numbers of practicing professionals and\n\n        community workers trained, and numbers of clients reached through\n\n        prevention, treatment, and care interventions.\n\n     *  Develop and improve capacity to collect client-level and clinical\n\n        service and surveillance information that will assist in daily\n\n        management of individual patient care, and to evaluate and\n\n        routinely report on the quality and outcomes of that care.\n\n     *  Develop and improve capacity to collect facility-and district-level\n\n        information that will assist clinic and program management, such as\n\n        targeted prevention activities and HIV testing and counseling.\n\n     *  Supplement the periodic collection of information with targeted\n\n        evaluation studies that address program effectiveness, the\n\n        feasibility of different intervention technologies, and improved\n\n        surveillance methods.\n\n     *  Design country-appropriate HIV management information systems (MIS)\n\n\n\n        that, integrate separate HIV information systems, including patient\n\n        care management, facility and program management, laboratory\n\n        reporting, logistics management, and routine reporting of\n\n        indicators to the national level and to the U.S. Government.\n\n     *  Integrate HIV/AIDS facility-based MIS into broader regional or\n\n        national health information systems to support the provision of\n\n        holistic and continuous care and to reduce the duplication and\n\n        burden of data collection and reporting within the facilities.\n\nIn order to build sustainable management systems over the long term, the strategic information system must take \ninto account the broader health care delivery system in which it will be implemented. A facility-based MIS structure \nshould permit generation of the necessary strategic information for rational decision-making at each level of the \nhealth system, from the facility to national and donor levels. As seen below, each user requires reliable and timely \ninformation to support its own set of management functions. These functions include individual patient care \nmanagement, facility management, and health program management at district, national, and international levels.\n\n  \u2022 \n\nThe first step in the long-term development of strategic information for HIV/AIDS facility-based interventions will be \nto define management functions at. each level, starting with the patient/client level. This process will ultimately \nmake it easier to identify the information required at each management level for decision support. Basic data \nelements (e.g., the number of new clients served) should not be lost as they are reported \"up.\" However, indicators \nand analysis of the information may differ at each level. Core indicators focus mainly on program management \nfunctions at district, national, and international levels. Health facilities require a different set of indicators for patient \nand facility management.\n\nAt the level of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator's Office, USG country offices will report critical indicators into one \nU.S. Government reporting system that is transparent, communicates with other international donors, and provides \naccess for the public to program information. Initial reporting will be on a semiannual basis.\n\nThis system will need to be built from the ground up. Existing facility-based health information systems in most \ncountries are unable to provide the information support needed to manage a broad range of health system \ninterventions. Some of the main reasons for this are inadequate financial and human resources; irrelevance and \nconsequentially poor data quality collected at the facility level; centralization and/or fragmentation of information \nsystem management; and poor health information system infrastructure. Experience in several countries in the last \ntwo decades has shown that decentralization of information management is an effective strategy to improve facility-\nbased management information systems. To support this approach we will need to adapt information needs to the \nspecific management functions at each level, produce high-quality information in a timely fashion, and ensure \nsufficient health information resources and careful management of the system.\n\nTo measure the \"2-7-10\" goals of President Bush's Emergency Plan, surveillance and program reporting systems \nwill need to indicate (1) the total number of clients reached with ART (including through PMTCT initiatives); (2) the \ntotal number of clients receiving care and support services, including TB/HIV clinical care and palliative care \nthrough home- or community-based programs; and (3) the total number of orphans and vulnerable children reached \nwith care and support. The number of infections prevented will be determined through modeling techniques using \nboth antenatal surveillance clinical information and behavioral surveillance data. Appendix G presents the \nEmergency Plan's program-level monitoring framework.\n\nThe strategic information underlying the President's Emergency Plan will not be accomplished by U.S. \nGovernment efforts alone. It will build upon international strategic information efforts to harmonize informational \nmeasures, provide monitoring and evaluation training in affected countries, and share gathered data. Both WHO \nand UNAIDS have formed donor coordinating groups for strategic information that address surveillance, monitoring \nand evaluation, and MIS. The United States will actively participate in these groups beginning with adoption of the \n\n\n\nWHO and UNAIDS guidelines on the construction of core HIV indicators. In consultation with the World Bank and \nthe Global Fund, the Emergency Plan will ensure that informational data collection by donors is aligned in targeted \ncountries to minimize the burden of information collection and to maximize the focus on HIV prevention, treatment, \nand care.\n\nThe task of health information system reform is both formidable and complex, particularly in the context of \ndeveloping countries. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator will provide the leadership, consensus \nbuilding, and commitment at the U.S. Government level to implement the health information restructuring that is \nneeded to measure progress under the President's Emergency Plan.\n\n3. Public-Private Partnerships\n\nPresident Bush believes that public-private partnerships offer a unique and sustainable opportunity for the provision \nof quality HIV/AIDS services with wide reach, as they combine the strengths of government, business, and civil \nsociety. Private sector innovations, resources, and expertise are essential to the battle against HIV/AIDS, which has \nstrained government and civil society responses.\n\nAs one example of the power and reach of public-private partnerships, innovations in the workplace can have broad \nimpacts on families, communities, and the entire socioeconomic fabric of a country. An estimated 26 million people-\n-more than 60 percent--of the 40 million living with HIV/AIDS are workers between the ages of 15 and 49, the most \neconomically active segment of society and the mainstay of families, communities, enterprises, and national \neconomies. UNAIDS projects that high-prevalence countries will see their workforces decrease by 10 to 34 percent \nas a result of AIDS by 2015 and that gross domestic product in the hardest-hit countries may decline by as much as \n8 percent by 2010.\n\nThe primary vehicle for protecting the workforce is the workplace. Workplaces, ranging from small businesses to \nmultinational corporations, provide regular access to workers, and by extension, their families and communities. \nExperience in Africa and the Caribbean has shown that workplace-related programs are often the only source of \nprevention, treatment, and care services for workers, their families, and their communities, and that combating \nstigma and discrimination in the workplace is essential to increasing the utilization of HIV/AIDS services. In some \ncases, multinational companies operating in Africa and the Caribbean have been the first to introduce HIV/AIDS \nprograms and policies and have set standards for the community at large, serving as models for the development of \nnational strategies. President Bush's Emergency Plan will coordinate with private corporations to provide \nHIV/AIDS services to community members through corporate health facilities.\n\nThe capacity of the private sector to reach broad sections of the population through workplaces and information \ncampaigns can promote a supportive culture throughout the community for defeating HIV/AIDS. In addition, public-\nprivate partnerships such as twinning of private sector technical expertise with groups developing HIV/AIDS \nprograms can play a crucial role in rapidly scaling up quality HIV/AIDS services.\n\nPublic-private partners share risks and accomplishments, as well as resources, including finances, infrastructure, \ninformation, and people to achieve a common goal. Private sector initiatives contribute resources outside of the \ntraditional health infrastructure and are critical for creating the social, cultural, and political environment that will \nenable the achievement of Emergency Plan goals.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships Objective:\n\nFoster public-private partnerships and provide support for the development of HIV/AIDS initiatives that complement \nthe treatment, prevention, and care goals of the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships Strategies:\n\n     *  Encouragement for the establishment and strengthening of\n\n        public-private partnerships at the international, national, and\n\n        enterprise levels to strengthen HIV/AIDS initiatives\n\n     *  Mobilization of private sector resources for HIV/AIDS programs,\n\n\n\n        including pooling of resources to gain economies of scale\n\n     *  Creation of an enabling environment for the private sector to\n\n        contribute their respective core competencies to the development of\n\n        national AIDS strategies\n\n     *  Inclusion of private sector representatives (including experts on\n\n        child labor) on country assessment and planning teams\n\n     *  Identification of workplace facilities/resources for inclusion in\n\n        clinical capacity building through the health network model\n\n     *  Provision of technical assistance to move existing workplace\n\n        programs into the community at large, strengthening the\n\n        sustainability of public programs and coverage of women\n\n     *  Creation of synergies to meld private sector initiatives with\n\n        broader national, regional, sectoral, and civil society efforts\n\n        already underway\n\nXI. APPENDICES\n\nAppendix A: Human Resources Capacity\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and many other parts of the world inadequate human resource and training \npolicies and weak institutions contribute to the insufficient supply of health care workers. In Kenya, for example, the \nMedical Association has more than 5,000 registered doctors but only 600 work in public hospitals, and the \ngovernment in 2001 received only eight applications for 100 advertised vacancies. The weak labor supply \nthroughout the region is further adversely affected by the emigration of trained and skilled health care personnel \n(see \"Brain Drain\" section below). There is thus an urgent need to increase health sector human resources, \nespecially skilled health workers such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and managers to address HIV/AIDS. \nAlthough not specifically addressed here, efforts must also be undertaken to remedy the lack of personnel with \nclerical, data entry, and administrative skills necessary to run effective programs.\n\nIncreasing and developing human resources has both short-term and long-term strategies. Professional training, \nespecially of physicians, takes years. Investments in schools made today may, therefore, not have a measurable \nimpact for some time. In the shorter term, providing HIV/AIDS specific training to already practicing professionals \ncan be of great benefit.\n\nThere is also an immediate for workers to provide counseling and testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and other \ntreatment and care services. These will be developed by recruiting and training community health workers, foreign \nvolunteer health professionals, and short-term in-country training of medical staffs.\n\nVolunteer doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other health care workers from the United States will be recruited and \ndeployed as a key component of our short-term strategy to meet the human capacity needs for HIV/AIDS treatment. \nThere are a large number of mechanisms, both public (Peace Corps, Freedom Corps, Crisis Corps, and various \nDHHS mechanisms) and private, by which such volunteers can be identified and supported. The Office of the U.S. \nGlobal AIDS Coordinator will undertake a systematic review of these options and, in consultation with host \ncountries, ministries of health, nongovernmental organizations, Congress, and others develop an approach to \ndeployment of volunteers that is effective, efficient, and driven by the needs and priorities identified in the field.\n\n\n\nThe twinning of U.S. with foreign institutions will allow for multifaceted exchanges of personnel and volunteers. \nCurricula can be exchanged and technical assistance and expertise provided. These activities can be expected to \nbe of great benefit to the U.S. institutions as well as foreign. Many innovative approaches to HIV/AIDS care, \ntreatment, and prevention developed in Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere in the world can and should be \nadapted for use in the United States.\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will also support local and national efforts to broaden responsibility for \ntreatment, care, and support, possibly including nurses, paramedics, lay counselors, and health volunteers. \nCommunity workers have been used to extend the medical system for successful provision of ART in some \nresource-poor settings. Community workers, volunteers, and family members have been trained to dispense drugs, \nnote occurrence of signs and symptoms of disease, note drug reactions, and refer to higher levels of care. This \nstrategy is essential in countries where the number of trained health care workers is limited. Efforts will focus on \ndetermining the tasks that must be completed in order to deliver quality ART (e.g., diagnosis, prescribing, \ncounseling, monitoring adherence, follow-up) and identifying and training the appropriate people to undertake these \nfunctions, with a focus on expanding ART services to the greatest number possible while maintaining quality \nstandards. To further extend treatment services into the community, President Bush's Emergency Plan will also \nexplore options to involve traditional healers and birth attendants, by training them to recognize HIV complications, \nprovide basic home-based care, communicate key messages, and refer patients to appropriate health care.\n\n1. Training\n\nShort-term training of existing health care professionals will build capacity. This can be accomplished through \ntraining exchanges as part of twinning programs. Training can also be provided by clinical experts who visit facilities \nin the focus countries for days, weeks, or months to provide lectures and clinical oversight. Finally, telemedicine can \nprovide case management support to clinicians, and distance education can address short-term training needs. \nTraining must include both didactic as well as clinical experiences. Care must be taken to establish procedures for \nsupervision of staff and regular monitoring of service quality. These short-term training exercises will be focused on \nskills-building, not diploma- or credential-building.\n\nLong-term human resource needs must be included in national strategic planning of each country. Increasing the \nquality and number of graduates from health care professional schools will be necessary. Capacity building in \nhealth care training will include curriculum development, creation of faculty and student exchange programs, and \ndevelopment of a comprehensive plan for long-term human resource needs. Training curricula at all medical, \nnursing, dental, pharmacy, and public health schools need to be reviewed and revised to incorporate the latest \ninformation on HIV/AIDS prevention, care (including palliative care), and treatment. Developing and adopting \nrelevant, applicable training programs can help minimize the difficulties and frustrations experienced by health care \nprofessionals working in resource-poor environments. In-service training and lifelong learning opportunities with \nemphasis on linkages between the learner's practical work experience and primary health care can help attract and \nretain workers.\n\nPrograms are also increasingly forging relationships with associations and groups of people living with HIV/AIDS to \ntrain their members to provide patient education, adherence counseling, and patient follow-up in order to tree \nclinical staff to perform higher-level tasks. Given the enormous human resource constraints, it will be critical to give \ngreater responsibility, through training and supervision, to greater numbers of health and human services workers in \norder to achieve treatment, prevention, and care goals.\n\n2. Recruitment and retention\n\nIn general, the ratios of health personnel to population in Africa are very low compared to those of other developing \ncountries. Few African countries meet the WHO \"Health for All\" standard of one doctor per 5,000 population. In the \nlate 1990s, the Emergency Plan focus countries of Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, \nUganda, and Zambia all had a ratio of one doctor per 10,000 people or more. The current ratio in Uganda is only \none doctor per 24,700 people. Comparable countries like Bolivia, Honduras, and India, have one doctor for every \n2,000 to 3,000 people. The ratio of nurses to population is also very low in sub-Saharan Africa--in Uganda, for \nexample, it is one nurse per 5,000 people.\n\n\n\nLabor supply in health sectors is thus a major concern to program policymakers and planners. The \"brain drain\" of \nmedical and health professionals to developed countries is overwhelming and a major contributing factor to the low \nhealth worker-to-population ratios. Practical strategies are needed to recruit and retain health professionals, ensure \nwell-trained workforces, and prevent the brain drain emigration of health workers.\n\nDomestic conditions can be improved by providing incentives and creating policies that reduce workforce attrition \nand attract medical professionals to return from affluent countries. More effective human resource management \nmay involve going beyond the narrow issues of salary and training to consider broader incentives and systems for \nencouraging and managing good performance. For example, Thailand and Ireland have reversed their brain drain \nthrough programs that offer generous research funding and monetary incentives as well as improved benefits and \nassistance. Sub-Saharan African countries similarly need to address structural, political, and economic problems \nthat lead to brain drain. Host-government actions might include increasing salaries for health professionals, \npermitting health professionals in the public sector to do some private practice, providing educational benefits for \ntheir children, and providing house mortgages and car loans at low interest rates.\n\nPractice conditions will improve as infrastructure and institutional capacity are developed, creating a stimulating \nenvironment for professional growth. Agreements should be sought with developed countries to ensure that donor-\nfunded programs do not offer exceptionally high salaries. Bilateral and international agreements about recruiting \nprocesses that minimize adverse effects on health care in exporting countries are also needed. The Pan American \nHealth Organization, for example, is developing a program of managed migration of nurses in the Caribbean, \ntraditionally a major source of employees for foreign recruiters.\n\nWhile the focus countries all have health care human resource shortages, some countries (Uruguay, for example) \nhave a surplus. Recruitment of health care professionals from countries with a surplus of human resources may be \na useful strategy for some countries. This recruitment will require changes in immigration and licensure policies in \nsome of the countries. President Bush's Emergency Plan will address these issues of policy reform and locating \nand recruiting doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other trained health care professionals.\n\n3. The \"brain drain\" of health care human resources from sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean\n\nThe already inadequate supply of health care workers in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean is further affected \nby the \"brain drain\" of trained medical and public health personnel to industrialized countries. Although \"brain drain\" \nemigration is not a new phenomenon, the growing number of health workers leaving sub-Saharan African countries \nexacerbates the shortage of health care personnel to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\nThe effects of brain drain are abundantly clear. In Zimbabwe, only 360 of 1,200 doctors trained in the 1990s are \npracticing domestically. Information from South African medical schools suggests that one-third to one-half of their \ngraduates emigrate to developed countries, mainly Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. WHO \nestimates that Zambia's health system needs 1,500 doctors but there are only about 800 doctors registered in the \ncountry (only 50 of whom work in the public sector), while many have migrated to work in affluent countries. The \nloss of nurses to developing countries is also extreme. For instance, 18,000 of Zimbabwe's nurses work abroad, \nmainly in the United Kingdom. Ghana loses more nurses annually to foreign employment than its nursing schools \ncan graduate.\n\nAfrican health workers who emigrate represent a serious economic setback to their countries. Many African \ngovernments heavily finance these workers' training. The U.N. Commission for Trade and Development has \nestimated that each migrating African professional represents a loss of $184,000 to Africa, while Africa spends $4 \nbillion a year on the salaries of 100,000 foreign experts.\n\nFactors fueling the brain drain. \"Push\" factors in developing countries that motivate health care personnel to migrate \ninclude professional dissatisfaction as a result of low remuneration, poor working conditions, and institutional \ninadequacies such as lack of technology and equipment, inadequate structures, weak internal systems and \npractices, lack of autonomy and incentives, and lack of funding for research. In many countries in Africa, larger \nsocial or political problems such as civil or ethnic strife, poor security, oppressive political climate, and persecution \nof or discrimination against intellectuals are factors. On the personal level, limited career prospects at home, poor \nintellectual stimulation, and the desire to seek a good education for children are motive for migrating.\n\n\n\nMajor \"pull\" factors (deliberate or unintended actions of the destination countries that attract health care \nprofessionals to recipient countries) include the high demand for health professionals in developed countries with \naging populations who require increasing amounts of care. For example, the United States had 126,000 unfilled \nnursing posts in 2002; by 2015, this shortage will increase to 500,000. Canada currently needs 16,000 nurses and \nwill need up to 113,000 nurses by 2011. In the United Kingdom, it was estimated that 15,000 foreign nurses were \nrecruited for positions in 2001, with 35,000 more needed by 2008. In 2006, Australia expects 31,000 nursing \nvacancies. To meet these needs, active recruitment of health care personnel is ongoing in sub-Saharan African \ncountries such as Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. According to the U.S. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, immigrants during fiscal year 2002 with medicine- and health-related occupations included \n64 from Kenya, 181 from Nigeria, 212 from South Africa, 15 from Uganda, 11 from Zambia, and 31 from Zimbabwe.\n\nImpacts of the brain drain. The loss of health workers to affluent countries is particularly harmful to sub-Saharan \nAfrican and Caribbean countries in the era of HIV/AIDS. Effects of the brain drain include:\n\n     *  Decline in quality of care;\n\n     *  Increased workloads for health workers left behind;\n\n     *  Adverse effects on leadership and morale;\n\n     *  Public sector costs for educating and training the emigrating\n\n        workers; and\n\n     *  Less effective and efficient use of other health infrastructure\n\n        resources\n\nClearly, Africa's human resources crisis in health care has a global dimension and an international inquiry and \nresponse is needed. The emigration of its health professionals needs to be urgently addressed to help stabilize its \nhealth care systems and institutions.\n\nAppendix B: Human Papilloma Virus in Sub-Saharan Africa the Impact of Condom Use on Its Spread\n\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is used to describe more than 100 different types of related viruses. HPV can be \ntransmitted through contact with skin surfaces or genital fluids infected with the virus.   Genital HPV infection is \nusually, though not always, sexually transmitted. While many other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been \nassociated with increased risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, this association has not been observed for HPV. \nHowever, persons with HIV/AIDS seem to be at increased risk for HPV infection and associated sequelae of HPV \ninfections such as genital warts and dysplasia.  \n\nCervical and anal/genital cancers, precancerous cervical tissue abnormalities, genital warts and wart-like lesions, \nand cervical cell dysplasia have been associated with infection with specific HPV types. Cervical cancer is the \nleading cancer among women in Africa.   The report of a workshop sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID) within the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) on the evidence of the effectiveness of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) \nconcludes that co-infection with HPV and HIV may lead to increased risk of cervical neoplasia and anal cancers \namong persons infected with HIV, as HIV suppresses the body's immune system.  \n\nThere is little known about the prevalence of HPV in sub-Saharan Africa.   ,   ,   Few studies on the prevalence of \nany STI, let alone HPV, have been conducted in the region. Of the available recent published reports, HPV \nresearch often covers specific populations in geographically specific areas of a country. For example, a 2001 study \nof HPV genotypes among 262 women in a rural area of Mozambique found that 40 percent of women in the study \ntested positive for at least one type of HPV.   A 2003 study of 429 female family planning clinic attendees in urban \nNairobi, Kenya, found an HPV prevalence of 44 percent. In addition, research sample sizes have been small and \nnon-representative, making it difficult to generalize to entire populations, and advanced definitive diagnostic \nmethods for HPV have only recently been made available. There have been no national or sentinel surveillance \n\n\n\nprograms to assess HPV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately HPV prevalence in \nthe region.\n\nAdditional HPV epidemiological research in developing countries is needed to develop more effective HPV and \ncervical cancer prevention strategies. The focus of this research should include the prevalence of specific HPV \nstrains associated with cervical cancer, the prevalence of cofactors affecting the progression to cervical cancer, \nregion-specific risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer, and the association between HIV infection and \nHPV epidemiology. Screening and treatment programs for cervical cancer are also recommended to prevent \ncervical cancer deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nCondoms have been shown to be effective in preventing the transmission of many STIs, including HIV/AIDS. \nBecause HPV is transmitted via skin-to-skin contact and genital fluids, HPV is not entirely preventable through \ncondom use. Laboratory and field-based research to evaluate the effectiveness of condoms in preventing HPV \ntransmission has been limited, but correct and consistent use of condoms can be expected to decrease (though not \neliminate) the risk of transmitting HPV.   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that a \nnumber of studies show an association between condom use and a reduced risk of HPV-associated diseases, \nincluding genital warts, cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer.   The previously mentioned 2001 NIAID workshop \nreport recommended that \"robust research be pursued to ascertain the true benefits and limitations of an available \nrisk reduction technology--latex male condoms--for preventing the transmission of STDs. At the same time, \nresearch on additional prevention technologies and behavioral interventions must also be pursued in order to \nadvance the health of the public in the U.S. and abroad.\"  \n\nAppendix C: Core Expertise of U.S. Government Agencies With Existing International HIV/AIDS Programs\n\nThe following list provides a brief description of the U.S. Government agencies and departments that are currently \nresponding to the international HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\nDepartment of Commerce\n\nThe HIV/AIDS initiative of the Department of Commerce (DOC) serves as a conduit to the private sector, \nparticularly to U.S. companies already engaged in HIV/AIDS activities or those not yet actively involved but \ninterested in partnering to combat HIV/AIDS. DOC's initiative promotes cross-sector collaboration; provides \ninformation on opportunities to foster partnerships, leverage resources, and transfer technologies to African \ncountries; and creates a dialogue with African countries to reduce trade barriers to health care products and \ndelivery systems.\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) currently supports military-to-military HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention \neducation in Africa and has supported the development of policies for dealing with HIV/AIDS in a military setting \nand the construction of facilities used for HIV/AIDS activities funded by other U.S. Government agencies. The \nDepartment's HIV vaccine research program has been transferred to HHS.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS)\n\nHHS, through its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its National Institutes of Health (NIH), and its \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), supports prevention, care, and treatment programs in \ndeveloping countries and conducts HIV/AIDS research.\n\n     *  CDC's Global AIDS Program provides technical assistance to\n\n        countries in the areas of primary prevention, surveillance and\n\n        infrastructure development, and care, support, and treatment.\n\n     *  NIH supports a comprehensive program of basic, clinical, and\n\n        behavioral research on HIV infection and its associated\n\n        opportunistic infections and malignancies that will lead to a\n\n\n\n        better understanding of the basic biology of HIV, the development\n\n        of effective therapies to treat it, and the design of better\n\n        interventions to prevent new infections, including vaccines and\n\n        microbicides. NIH supports an international research portfolio\n\n        encompassing more than 50 countries and is the lead agency for\n\n        bio-medical research on AIDS.\n\n     *  HRSA provides training and technical assistance, including\n\n        twinning, nurse training, and palliative care programs in\n\n        collaboration with CDC in the HHS Global AIDS Program countries.\n\n     *  In addition, the Food and Drug Administration serves as an\n\n        important advisory resource on drug quality, safety, and efficacy,\n\n        and conducts related HIV/AIDS activities.\n\nDepartment of Labor\n\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) supports projects that target the workplace for prevention education and \nstrengthen the response to HIV/AIDS by providing technical assistance to governments, employees, and labor \nleaders. DOL also funds an international assistance program to reduce workplace stigma and discrimination \nagainst people living with HIV/AIDS. It also has an extensive international technical assistance program focused on \nchild labor that works with the International Labor Organization, UNICEF, NGOs, and FBOs to implement programs \ntargeting HIV-affected children forced to work and children involved in prostitution.\n\nDepartment of State\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is located within the Department of State. The Coordinator has \nprimary responsibility for the oversight and coordination of all resources and international activities of the U.S. \nGovernment to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In \naddition the Department of State supports a wide range of HIV/AIDS activities and small-scale programs through its \nembassies in 162 countries. Most of these activities and small programs focus on prevention. Chiefs of Mission and \nother American officials engage in policy discussions with leaders to generate additional attention and resources for \nthe epidemic. Small projects usually are closely targeted at the specific needs of the host country, developed in \ncoordination with local nongovernmental organizations and municipalities, and spearheaded by the U.S. \nAmbassador. Embassies also use the tools of public diplomacy to reach out. through print and electronic media, to \nfacilitate exchange programs, etc. In many countries, the Ambassador's Self-Help Program provides small-scale \nassistance to projects that entail extensive community involvement.\n\nPeace Corps\n\nThe Peace Corps has more than 3,000 volunteers working on HIV/AIDS projects, including 1,000 volunteers \ncommitted as a result of the Emergency Plan. The goal of the Peace Corps HIV/AIDS program is to build \ncommunity-level capacity to address the pandemic's social, economic, and health impacts, particularly in rural \nareas. All volunteers serving in Africa, regardless of sector, are trained to serve as advocates and educators for \nHIV/AIDS prevention. In addition, the Peace Corps offers a short-term program called the Crisis Corps that \nmobilizes former Peace Corp Volunteers to help countries address critical needs, including HIV/AIDS.\n\nU.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nUSAID has been the lead U.S. Government agency fighting the global AIDS pandemic since 1986. Currently, \nUSAID has bilateral programs in 50 countries and reaches an additional 48 countries through regional programs. \nUSAID provides assistance through an \"expanded response\" operational plan, which focuses on countries where \nthe magnitude and severity of the disease is high with strategies designed to respond to a particular country's \nepidemic. In addition to its prevention, treatment, and care programs, USAID also has expertise in the management \n\n\n\nof pharmaceutical logistics; supports operational and biomedical research; and strengthens health systems so \ncountries are better able to respond to HIV/AIDS. USAID's HIV/AIDS programs are coordinated with other \ndevelopment programs, including food aid, housing, education, rule of law, as well as with health care activities in \ntuberculosis, malaria, and maternal health.\n\nAppendix DTHE EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF USG CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL HIV/AIDS, TB, & \nMALARIA FY 2003-2005\n\n  \u2022 \n\nAppendix E: Focus Country HIV/AIDS Profile Information2001 HIV/AIDS Data for Focus Countries of the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\n\n  \u2022 \n\nAppendix F: U.S. Government HIV/AIDS Bilateral Programs of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief (Focus countries in bold)\n\nThe U.S. Government, through USAID and HHS, has substantial programs in 101 countries, including the \nEmergency Plan focus countries. In addition, through DOD, DOL, and Peace Corps, the U.S. Government has a \nnumber of smaller bilateral programs in additional countries.\n\n  \u2022 \n\n  \u2022 \n\n  \u2022 \n\nAppendix G: The Emergency Plan's Program-Level Monitoring Framework\n\n  \u2022 \n\nAppendix H: Summary of HHS Research Strategy\n\nThe National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-43) provided that the Director of the \nOffice of AIDS Research (OAR) \"shall plan, coordinate and evaluate research and other activities conducted or \nsupported\" by the NIH. The Director of OAR \"shall act as the primary Federal official with responsibility for \noverseeing all AIDS research conducted or supported by the National Institutes of Health\" and \"shall establish a \ncomprehensive plan for the conduct and support of all AIDS activities of the agencies of the National Institutes of \nHealth...; ensure that the Plan establishes priorities among the AIDS activities that such agencies are authorized to \ncarry out; ensure that the Plan establishes objectives regarding such activities...; and ensure that the Plan serves \nas a broad, binding statement of policies regarding AIDS activities of the agencies, but does not remove the \nresponsibility of the heads of the agencies for the approval of specific programs or projects, or for other details of \nthe daily administration of such activities, in accordance with the Plan.\" The law further provides that \"the Director of \nthe OAR shall ensure that the Plan provides for basic research; provides for applied research; provides for research \nthat is supported and conducted by the agencies; provides for proposals developed pursuant to solicitations by the \nagencies and for proposals developed independently of such solicitations; and provides for behavioral research and \nsocial science research.\"\n\nHighlights from the plan are provided below. More detailed information can be obtained at  \nhttp://www.nih.gov/od/oar/public/public.htm#PLAN \n\nVaccine development\n\nhttp://www.nih.gov/od/oar/public/public.htm#PLAN\n\n\nA safe and effective HIV vaccine would provide a valuable tool to prevent HIV infection. Despite years of extensive \nresearch, however, a vaccine to prevent HIV infection remains elusive. Private- and government-sponsored \nresearch continues, focusing on defining necessary vaccine components and the best means of vaccine delivery to \nensure the optimal protective response.\n\nThe process of vaccine development will benefit from a strategic alliance that ensures coordination among the \nagencies working to identify a safe and effective HIV/AIDS vaccine, particularly as activities to evaluate promising \ncandidate vaccines in developing countries progress. The Emergency Plan offers an unprecedented opportunity to \ndevelop interagency alliances. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has created a new strategic \nalliance--Partners in AIDS Vaccine Evaluation (PAVE)--in which the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases (NIAID/HHS) will be joined by the NIH Office of AIDS Research, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. PAVE will invite \nparticipation from nongovernmental organizations that are collaborating directly with government agencies on HIV \nvaccine development. PAVE will serve as a forum to achieve increased efficiencies and cost-effectiveness for all \nvaccine evaluations under its auspices. A steering group comprising the principals from the three governmental \nagencies and the chair of NIH's AIDS Vaccine Research Working Group will serve as PAVE's principal advisory \ngroup.\n\nPAVE will focus initially on preparing for phase III trials, which will involve:\n\n     *  Developing common immunological, virological, safety, and other\n\n        laboratory capabilities worldwide;\n\n     *  Strengthening clinical trial site capacity in developing countries,\n\n        including the development and use of common training modules and\n\n        site development priorities and standards; and\n\n     *  Developing shared, compatible protocols.\n\nStrategies include:\n\n1. Central medical centers: Institutions suitable for hosting central medical centers to serve as hubs or referral \ncenters for institutions conducting HIV vaccine trials will be identified. Logistical, managerial, operational, ethical, \nand regulatory support will be provided to ensure adequate capacity for conducting large-scale trials and to help \nlink existing networks to future central medical centers.\n\n2. Efficacy trials: Support will be provided to identify and advance promising candidate vaccines to efficacy trials, \nincluding trials in five to seven targeted countries. These trials will evaluate vaccine safety and efficacy against \nlocally circulating strains of HIV.\n\n3. Phase I/II studies: Phase I/II studies in two to three targeted countries will be conducted to evaluate the safety \nand immunogenicity of promising candidate vaccines; to train research staff in the conduct of HIV vaccine trials; to \nestablish standard operating procedures for high-quality, ethically sound trials; and to ensure that appropriate \nreporting and oversight procedures are in place. Knowledge from clinical trials will be used to improve vaccine \ndesign and make vaccines more effective.\n\n4. Capacity building: Health care delivery networks need to be strengthened so they have the components and \ncapacities necessary to conduct trials of the highest caliber and integrate these activities into care and prevention \nprograms. These components and capacities include:\n\n     *  Sufficient numbers of motivated and trained medical, laboratory,\n\n        and support personnel;\n\n     *  Equipment to plan, conduct, and oversee quality vaccine trials;\n\n     *  The capacity to follow patients for prolonged periods;\n\n     *  The ability to maintain medical records according to international\n\n\n\n        standards; and\n\n     *  Appropriate reporting and oversight procedures to ensure the\n\n        protection of human subjects, data quality, and study integrity.\n\nThe linkages among federally supported vaccine development programs need to be strengthened with emphasis on \npreparing sites for HIV vaccine efficacy trials.\n\n5. Public-private partnerships: Expansion of public-private partnerships in HIV vaccine development will help \nengage the expertise necessary to advance candidate vaccines through the clinical pipeline. Partnerships should \nprovide support to companies for developing manufacturing and testing processes and producing sufficient doses of \nthe most promising candidate vaccines for efficacy trials.\n\nMicrobicide development\n\nIn the absence of a safe and effective vaccine, the options for sexually active women--particularly those who are \ncoerced or forced to have sex--to protect themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections remain \nminimal. A safe and effective topical microbicide (i.e., an antimicrobial product applied topically that inhibits or \ninactivates HIV) would offer another means of protection for women beyond condoms.\n\nUnder the Emergency Plan, HHS will continue to support a comprehensive program for discovering, developing, \ntesting, and evaluating microbicides for HIV prevention.\n\nNIH is the major federal sponsor of microbicide research and development, supporting microbicide design research \nand microbicide development and production. Under the Emergency Plan, NIH will expand the HIV Prevention \nTrials Network, a worldwide network for collaborative multidisciplinary, multisite clinical trials established by NIH to \nevaluate the safety and efficacy of non-vaccine HIV prevention interventions.\n\nNIH has also spearheaded an effort to develop a U.S. Government strategic plan for microbicides, which \nincorporates the microbicide activities of agencies within HHS such as NIH, CDC, and the Food and Drug \nAdministration, as well as USAID. This strategic plan provides a blueprint for a coordinated effort structured to \naddress each step involved in developing and testing potential microbicides and their subsequent implementation in \nprevention activities.\n\nStrategies include:\n\n1. Basic biological and physiological research related to microbicides: This research will elucidate the basic \nmechanisms of HIV transmission (both virus and host factors) and other sexually transmitted infections at mucosal \nsurfaces. Such research is important for developing and applying microbicides in diverse populations.\n\n2. Microbicide development and preclinical studies: The Emergency Plan will support the discovery, \ndevelopment, and preclinical evaluation of topical microbicides alone and in combination.\n\n3. Microbicide formulations and modes of delivery: Programs will develop and assess acceptable formulations \nand modes of delivery for microbicides, bridging knowledge and applications from the chemical, pharmaceutical, \nphysical, bioengineering, and social sciences.\n\n4. Clinical trials of microbicide products: Clinical studies of candidate microbicides will be conducted to assess \ntheir safety, acceptability, and effectiveness in reducing the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted \ninfections in diverse populations in domestic and international settings.\n\n5. Behavioral and social science research related to microbicides: Basic and applied behavioral and social \nscience research will be conducted to enhance microbicide development, testing, acceptability, and use \ndomestically and internationally.\n\n6. Training and infrastructure: Infrastructure and training needs will be met to permit international and domestic \nmicrobicide research to proceed and to accelerate access to microbicidal products in diverse populations.\n\nTherapeutics research\n\n\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in understanding how HIV attacks the immune system and how to treat it. \nResearchers have developed new methods to detect and measure HIV in blood and tissue and to test for \nantiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance. Therapeutic regimens using combinations of drugs have extended and \nimproved the quality of life for many HIV-infected people in developed nations and have led to declines in AIDS-\nrelated mortality.\n\nThere is an urgent need today to extend these benefits to developing countries hardest hit by the disease. \nResearch is needed to determine how best to deliver and monitor antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to manage the \nclinical treatment of adults and children in resource-limited settings. Additionally, research is needed to determine \nthe spectrum of opportunistic infections and co-infections in threatened populations and their impact on HIV \ninfection and disease progression.\n\nUnder the President's Emergency Plan, the United States will support the expansion of preclinical drug \ndevelopment resources; feasibility studies and efficacy trials for ARV and antimicrobial drugs; and the provision of \nlaboratory support for diagnostics, clinical trials, and expanded treatment delivery. As part of this effort, NIH is \nworking with France's Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA and the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort \nCollaboration to develop a database that will collect treatment-related data from a large number of research sites in \ndeveloping countries. Systematic analyses of the database may permit comparisons of the short- and long-term \neffectiveness of ART in these sites and developed countries. The database also will facilitate studies on other \naspects of treatment-related operational research. Findings from this project may provide important models for \nmultisite, multicountry operational research that will complement traditional clinical research models in establishing \nthe effectiveness of antiretroviral strategies in developing countries.\n\nTuberculosis research\n\nWorldwide, tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons. Research is needed to determine the \nincidence of TB infection and co-infection, improve diagnostic capability, and develop and deliver affordable and \neffective therapies to adults and children in developing countries. Important research questions include the \neffectiveness and tolerance of different dosing regimens and comparisons of providing concurrent TB/ARV \ntreatment and providing TB treatment before ART.\n\nResearch is needed to:\n\n     *  Determine incidence of TB infection and co-infection;\n\n     *  Improve diagnostic capability, especially given the significant\n\n        lower sensitivity of current methods in person infected with HIV;\n\n     *  Develop and deliver affordable and effective therapies to adults\n\n        and children in developing countries;\n\n     *  Determine the effectiveness and tolerance of different dosing\n\n        regimens and comparisons of providing concurrent TB/ARV treatment;\n\n     *  Optimize timing of providing TB treatment before ART;\n\n     *  Develop new drugs to combat the problem of emerging drug resistance;\n\n     *  Develop and test molecular targets for tuberculosis vaccines\n\n        tailored for HIV-infected persons, including those in largely\n\n        BCG-vaccinated populations;\n\n     *  Develop models for building community-research partnerships with\n\n        local health units in ethnically diverse communities;\n\n     *  Focus on the special problems of children co-infected with\n\n        tuberculosis and HIV; and\n\n\n\n     *  Refine cooperative strategies between tuberculosis and HIV\n\n        prevention and control activities.\n\nMalaria research\n\nMalaria is a major cause of death and disability in Africa. The research agenda will include:\n\n     *  The genome sequencing of the malaria parasite Plasmodium\n\n        falciparum and of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae;\n\n     *  Development of molecular tools to genetically manipulate the\n\n        parasite and vector in studies relevant to drug and vaccine\n\n        discovery;\n\n     *  Pathogenesis and vector control;\n\n     *  Identification of the genes mediating chloroquine and insecticide\n\n        resistance and molecular techniques to characterize drug-resistant\n\n        parasites from clinical isolates;\n\n     *  An accelerated malaria vaccine research and development program;\n\n     *  Quantification of the economic impacts of malaria in endemic\n\n        countries;\n\n     *  Discovery and development of new antimalarial drugs from plants,\n\n        animals, and microorganisms; and\n\n     *  Development of predictive models of the transmission risk for many\n\n        infectious diseases, including malaria, in relation to major\n\n        environmental disturbance events.\n\nAppendix I: USAID's HIV/AIDS Research Strategy\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development has been a leader in fighting HIV/AIDS since 1986. One of the key \ncomponents of USAID's HIV/AIDS program has been to conduct biomedical and operational research to develop \nand evaluate new tools for providing antiretroviral therapy, preventing HIV transmission, and caring for people living \nwith AIDS.\n\nThe major focus of USAID's research is to address needs for program implementation in resource-limited settings. \nUSAID-funded research is comprehensive, from identifying a program problem to research and efficacy \nverification, to field testing and then finally full implementation in developing countries.\n\nTreatment\n\nAntiretroviral Therapy\n\nThere are many complex issues related to the introduction and impact of antiretroviral therapy in resource-\nconstrained settings. Current research examines methods to improve ease of administration and adherence to \ntherapy and methods to decrease drug tolerance and side effects. Antiretroviral therapy implementation sites also \nserve as learning sites. Three USAID introductory sites are models for anti-retro viral treatment.\n\nPreventing Mother-to-Child Transmission\n\nOperations research currently underway includes:\n\n     *  Studies to determine the effectiveness of introducing a package of\n\n\n\n        prevention of mother-to-child transmission services into existing\n\n        antenatal, maternal, and child health services; and\n\n     *  Development and implementation of packaging options that could\n\n        create a sustainable supply of nevirapine in single or small-dose\n\n        packaging.\n\nPrevention\n\nABC: Abstinence, Be Faithful, Use Condoms\n\nUSAID has carried out pioneering studies in the area of behavior change for successful HIV prevention, including a \nrecently funded six-country study on ABC and has published an important paper analyzing the success of the ABC \napproach in Uganda. New studies are being planned to optimize the implementation of ABC interventions for youth \nand at-risk groups.\n\nMale Circumcision\n\nClinical trials are currently underway to review whether male circumcision has a strongly protective effect on HIV \ntransmission. USAID is supporting research in Haiti, Zambia, Kenya, and South Africa to learn more about issues of \nsafety and complications, acceptability and feasibility, and the logistical issues involved in developing pilot \ndemonstration services for safe/affordable male circumcision and male reproductive health.\n\nInjection Safety\n\nIn addition to the transfusion of HIV-infected blood, transmission of HIV in the health care setting can occur through \nunsafe injections and other unsafe medical practices, including occupational exposure to blood. USAID is \nsupporting research in this area, including:\n\n     *  Evaluation of health care worker acceptance of single-use devices;\n\n     *  Field safety comparisons of new devices; and\n\n     *  Pioneering and evaluating the use of bundling an injectable\n\n        contraceptive commodity with auto-disable syringes and safety boxes.\n\nCare\n\nNutrition\n\nHIV infection affects nutrition through reduction in dietary intake, nutrient malabsorption, and complex metabolic \nalterations that culminate in weight loss and wasting. USAID is implementing research on:\n\n     *  The impact/effectiveness of providing nutrition supplements on\n\n        adherence to antiretroviral treatment and return for HIV care;\n\n     *  Cost and feasibility of incorporating nutrition supplements into\n\n        antiretroviral treatment programs; and\n\n     *  Nutrient and caloric formulation of nutrition supplements in\n\n        children and adults living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nOrphans and Vulnerable Children\n\nUSAID-supported projects for orphans and vulnerable children aim to increase a family's ability to provide care and \nsupport to children affected by AIDS. USAID supports research to identify successful approaches, including \nstudying:\n\n     *  Effectiveness of interventions to help parents and families\n\n        affected by HIV plan for their children's future care;\n\n\n\n     *  Psychosocial issues affecting adolescent orphans and vulnerable\n\n        children; and\n\n     *  Different models to enhance food security and nutrition in programs\n\n        assisting orphans and vulnerable children.\n\nBiomedical Research\n\nMicrobicides\n\nBecause standard prevention strategies are often out of the control of women, USAID is actively developing \nmicrobicides--a female-controlled chemical barrier to the AIDS virus. USAID's research priorities are the \nidentification of the best active agents for use in new microbicidal products, early-stage clinical studies to establish \nthe safety and acceptability of potential new microbicides, advanced clinical studies to test the effectiveness of the \nmost promising microbicide candidates in large-scale trials, and planning the introduction of the most appropriate \nmicrobicides in the context of developing countries.\n\nVaccines\n\nPrevention of HIV infection remains a primary strategy in the fight against the worldwide HIV pandemic, and a safe \nand effective HIV vaccine would provide an extremely important tool for this purpose. USAID funds the \nInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative to accelerate the development and introduction of new vaccine candidates and \ntechnologies and link vaccine designers with manufacturers and with developing country sites suitable for testing \npromising HIV vaccine candidates.\n\nUSAID's Tuberculosis and Malaria Research Strategies\n\nTuberculosis\n\nUSAID's investment in global tuberculosis control includes support for focused research in a number of critical \nareas. Of the 40 million HIV-infected people worldwide, almost one-third are also infected with TB. USAID's \nresearch in this area includes:\n\n     *  Development of new and improved diagnostics appropriate for use in\n\n        developing and transitional countries and functional in a variety\n\n        of settings (including areas of high HIV-prevalence);\n\n     *  Development of new drug treatment regimens and new drugs which are\n\n        easier to use, safer, lower in cost, and less labor-intensive to\n\n        administer;\n\n     *  Strengthening of clinical trial capacity for the evaluation of new\n\n        diagnostics, drugs, and drug treatment regimens, and strengthening\n\n        of operations research capacity at the country level;\n\n     *  Improving the management and delivery of care for\n\n        multidrug-resistant TB;\n\n     *  Research on the impact of antiretroviral therapy on TB infection;\n\n     *  Testing model approaches to improve care and support within general\n\n        health services to persons with HIV and TB; and\n\n     *  Generating evidence on the best mix of TB/HIV activities according\n\n        to different levels of HIV prevalence.\n\nMalaria\n\n\n\nAs many as 900 million cases of malaria occur every year, directly and indirectly causing up to 2.7 million deaths. \nPriority research areas include:\n\n     *  Malaria vaccine research;\n\n     *  Issues on delivery and rapid deployment of the most promising\n\n        malaria treatment currently available;\n\n     *  New drug development in collaboration with the Medicines for\n\n        Malaria venture\n\n     *  Community approaches to vector management; and\n\n     *  Issues related to co-infection of malaria and HIV.\n\nAppendix J: Summary of Testimony and Recommendations Received 12/18/03 at the PACHA Townhall \nMeeting\n\nThe commentary and papers received by the PACHA International Committee on behalf of Ambassador Tobias and \nthe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief were broadly focused and rich in experience and passion. \nTogether they provided a number of consistent messages and subsequent recommendations that will hopefully \nenhance the efforts underway and still being developed to ensure the success of the Emergency Plan. Below is a \nbrief summary of the principal issues and themes that arose in the verbal and written comments received during the \nTownhall Meeting based on the three questions disseminated before the meeting.\n\n1.  What lessons can you provide/share regarding planning, implementation, and outcome measurements \nstrategies that have worked best and what did not work and why?\n\n2.  What are the vital aspects of effective partnerships and with whom?\n\n3.  How have you been able to effectively involve people living with HIV/AIDS in your work?\n\nHIV treatment/access to antiretroviral drugs:\n\nNothing should get in the way of the overarching goal of providing universal access to treatment. Parallel issues, \nsuch as trade agreements on intellectual property rights and generic medicines, should be congruent with this goal, \nas well as decreasing the costs of medicines.\n\nAccess to ARVs is an absolute priority that reduces stigma, improves health of the individual, the community, the \neconomic viability and social structures of a nation. ARVs are being done, can be done effectively and safely and \ncan be scaled up quickly in most of the Emergency Plan's focus countries. Such implementation requires a \ndifferent approach to the \"the western medical model.\" Barriers must be reduced to allow the use of combination \npills (generics), new algorithms of treatment success, and understanding that a perfect model of implementation \ndoes not exist. Many models must be urgently instituted with failures in some expected, but with the understanding \nthat the good outweighs the bad in this approach in lives saved and children raised by their own parents.\n\nAccess to holistic care includes non-ARV health interventions that have also been proven effective in reducing \nmorbidity and mortality. Care needs to be comprehensive and not just focused on medication distribution. Many \nwere concerned too much emphasis is currently on ARVs, that other important aspects may be getting inadequate \nattention, such as:\n\n     *  Adequate nutritional supplementation and food security\n\n     *  Clean water\n\n     *  Palliative care (treatment of suffering, and symptom management)\n\nThere was an emphasis on paying attention to the social/family dynamics of the disease:\n\n     *  The need to attend to the care of orphans\n\n\n\n     *  Make care family-centered\n\n     *  Utilize friends and family members (natural support systems) as\n\n        part of the care model\n\n     *  There is a continued need to address the issues of stigma reduction\n\nThere is a need to accelerate AIDS vaccine research. It was suggested that this, and the development of effective \nmicrobicides, should have comparable federal incentives as the research of TB-related vaccines.\n\nCommunication strategies require the development of sound evidence-based messages that utilize multiple \ncommunications media and technologies that cater to the learning needs, languages, culture, and access \nrequirements of specific groups, especially in remote areas for women, men, youth, and children.\n\nTreatment and care must be simple, adapted to local conditions and decentralized.\n\nDesign of service delivery strategies should include:\n\nMultisectoral in response--including a health response (technical), social, economic, financial, and political \nresponses. Multifaceted problems require multifaceted solutions.\n\nCommunity in all aspects from care delivery to leadership and decision-making.\n\nIn-country collaboration broadly defined to include local leadership, public-private partnerships, ministries of health, \nfaith-based organizations, and health worker collaborations among the various disciplines. Also necessary is \ncollaboration among the donor agencies working with specific organizations. The lack of streamlined and \ncompatible technology was identified as a potential barrier to effective programming and collaboration, as many \ndifferent organizations, each with different information processing systems, are involved in combating HIV/AIDS. \nLogistics, specifically the ability to have consistent access to quality supplies, was also identified as a barrier to the \nsuccess of programs.\n\nCulturally appropriate and relevant solutions, delivery strategies, and training methodologies that include respect for \nthe oral traditions of learning and retention of information, the learning style and the proven strategy of the message \nbeing delivered by trusted members within the group, peer-to-peer learning, and interventions be instituted at all \nlevels of strategies.\n\nFocus on women and families with key support for prevention efforts and treatment shifts to reduce the burden of \nnew infections as well as reduce the number of children becoming orphans.\n\nLocal capacity building and use of volunteers is an important part of any strategy that brings a different motivation to \nthe rebuilding of communities and health delivery strategies. While extremely important, this has to be done with \ncaution as communities are already overwhelmed with too much emphasis and reliance on their function.\n\nNon-physician health workers such as nurses, community health workers, midwives, and traditional healers who are \nthe main providers of the African health delivery system. The focus on physician-driven efforts and training, while \nvaluable in the long term, are neither immediate and are limited in their effect in the field. The immediate relevant \ninclusion of non-physician health workers into decision-making, leadership, resources, and scale up to sustain work \nand practice is critical to the success of the Emergency Plan. The training provided to this group must be \ndeveloped and delivered by peers. These training initiatives and linkages to the ministries of health are new models \n(in fact the U.S. health delivery leaders have little experience with these type of educational and training models) \nthat have hidden power barriers that can limit the ability of these workers to be enhanced and will require significant \nleadership on how to work collaboratively and truly empower this group to be effective. Nurses were significantly \npointed out in over 10 of the commentaries.\n\nUse of existing infrastructures such as faith-based care centers that already mandate holistic care, respect for the \ncommunity, and demonstrate willingness can ensure effective use of Emergency Plan funds and sustainability \nover time. A modest investment can go a long way.\n\nPromoting behavioral change:\n\n\n\nPrevention as the primary weapon to combat HIV. Turning the tide requires dramatically reducing the number of \nnew infections. A few organizations emphasized abstinence and fidelity as appropriate, effective, and necessary \npreventions strategies. Participants testified that treatment has a huge role to play in mitigating the consequences \nof HIV/AIDS, but prevention has to remain a primary aim.\n\nBehavior change for sexual transmission is proving effective on a number of fronts that include each component of \nthe ABC model. Caution to the use of a one-size-fits-all approach was repetitious in the commentary. The emphasis \non A and B was welcome especially by the faith-based groups and churches that are providing the bulk of health \ncare delivery and social modeling. Culturally relevant and community-driven prevention efforts should be the long-\nterm focus and goal.\n\nBehavior change in health delivery requires immediate attention and the systems that support the spread of non-\nsexual transmission of HIV such as safety for health workers, equipment in treatment facilities and policies that \nsupport the reduction of this underreported transmission route. This also impacts the sustainability of a health \nworkforce. We heard that 2-3 nurses are dying monthly in Kenya from possible occupational exposure. The \nimmediate treatment of the health workforce must be part of the Emergency Plan. With examples such as Daimler-\nChrysler and the Global Business Council using comprehensive workforce policy and programs, the President's \nInitiative should ensure that this style of health workforce program be enacted in both the public (Ministries of \nHealth) and the private (Mission) sectors. The Mission health systems are providing about 40-70% of all health \ndelivery in many of the Emergency Plan focus countries and will require resources to move forward on this end.\n\nThe development of alternatives to condoms must be enhanced, such as microbicides and gender rights issues. As \nwomen are increasingly infected, the previously heavy reliance on condoms or other male-driven responsibility \nmeasures must be attended to. The development of female-centered technologies should be prioritized so that \nother methods of prevention besides condom use can be promoted specifically with women. Strategies must be put \nin place to address vulnerabilities of women, including social rules that inhibit their ability to negotiate sex and the \nuse of condoms. Participants emphasized that a gender strategy intended to empower women must target men and \nboys to change attitudes.\n\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS are vital contributors to prevention efforts, fighting stigma, and planning effective \ninterventions. Their involvement is crucial.\n\nYouth make the greatest proportion of new infections, participants emphasized strategies that target youth.\n\nProgram interventions to assist orphans and vulnerable children must be community-based, building on community \ncoping mechanisms with an eye to sustainability.\n\nIssues of program effectiveness in HIV/AIDS:\n\nPrograms must strike a balance between the urgency of the pandemic and the long-term investments and \nstrategies required to develop sustainable services.\n\nWell-conceived and thought-out community planning processes built on bottom-up approaches have had greater \nsuccess in mobilizing community involvement and ownership. This has led to lower costs in service delivery and \ngreater access to resources for families.\n\nPrograms need to take better advantage of skills and resources of health professionals at the local level.\n\nWe need to develop new kinds of community involvement to prevent social fatigue, such as patient-centered \nadherence and programs to de-stigmatize HIV/AIDS.\n\nOperations research has not been part of funding strategies in development work and must be considered as the \nEmergency Plan is initiated to measure progress, identify lessons learned and improve program effectiveness on a \ncontinuing and permanent basis. Developing national capacities for data collection and implementation monitoring \nwill be important for creating successful programs.\n\nSustainability:\n\nAnother consistent thread was for HIV/AIDS health services to be addressed in a broader scope of development \nand poverty reduction that are fueling the HIV pandemic. Incorporating collaborations that address nutrition, food \n\n\n\nsecurity, clean water, reproductive health care, sanitation, economic/job solutions to family members ill that cannot \nsupport the health of the family is crucial.\n\nScaling up successful pilot projects has had dismal results to date. While outcomes research as the test of the \nsuccess of a program is important, they must now include operations research to ensure that scale up can be \neffective.\n\nSuccessful HIV programs are one part ARV and nine parts development. Programs should be comprehensive and \naddress the multifaceted nature of human health and welfare as it relates to HIV/AIDS.\n\nAdministrative policy in the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief:\n\nThe structure of the procurement process for grants from the Emergency Plan should facilitate and encourage \npartnership arrangements to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThe Emergency Plan should revisit, on a permanent basis, the procurement rules to ensure that they are not too \nrigid and burdensome.\n\nLocal institutions:\n\nLinks with local institutions are critical to successful interventions. However, it is important not only to view local \ninstitutions as a means to achieving program goals, but to recognize them as institutions in their own right, with their \nown identity that form a part of a social fabric for development.\n\nWorking with local churches who are providing HIV care and treatment as well as education should be strengthened \nand expanded. Patient fellowships between PLWA through local churches are one way to develop new social \nnetworks for prevention, treatment, and care.\n\nNational and global coordination:\n\nInitiatives promoted by the President's Initiative should be articulated and integrated into the national AIDS plans of \nthe countries in which they are implemented, focusing on strengthening national capacities to facilitate local \ninitiatives.\n\nThe Emergency Plan should develop effective coordination and collaboration mechanisms with the Global Fund \nand the World Health Organization three by five program.\n\nIn addition to the above summary from the public comments, the PACHA International Subcommittee would like to \nmake the following suggestions:\n\nThe Emergency Plan should institute a vigorous evaluation component to ensure desired outcomes and the \nmandate from Congress is achieved.\n\nThe Initiative's program strategies should encourage HIV/AIDS care burden-sharing with recipient's countries. The \ncountries should be mandated to do their fair share of providing adequate health care to citizens. The success of \nany program in Africa requires firm commitment and active participation of local governments of the African \ncountries. The political will and determination of the African governments are necessary to ensure the success of \ncombating HIV/AIDS in their countries.\n\nEmergency Plan funding should be used to complement and not serve as a substitute or replacement for HIV \nactivity work that is currently in place through various international and local agencies.\n\nIn-country community mobilization and capacity building is a crucial aspect of all programs.\n\nThe Request for Proposals (RFPs) process should be made less cumbersome. It was clear that there was \nconsiderable confusion about the \"process\" of the RFPs that had recently been solicited. The time frame and the \nnature of it needs to be explained going forward especially in light of the fact that there will be \"different\" RFPs \ncoming down the pike.\n\n\n\nAppendix K: ACRONYMS\n\nAIDS Acquired immune deficiency syndrome\n\nART Antiretroviral therapy\n\nARV Antiretroviral (drugs, treatment, etc.)\n\nCBO Community-based organization\n\nCDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (HHS)\n\nDOC Department of Commerce, U.S.\n\nDOD Department of Defense, U.S.\n\nDOL Department of Labor, U.S.\n\nFBO Faith-based organization\n\nFDC Fixed-dose combination\n\nFY Fiscal year\n\nHHS Health and Human Services (U.S. Department of)\n\nHIV Human immunodeficieny virus\n\nHPV Human, papilloma virus\n\nHRSA Health Resources and Services Administration (HHS)\n\nICRC International Committee of the Red Cross\n\nILO International Labor Organization\n\n\n\nMAP Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for Africa (World Bank)\n\nMIS Management information, system\n\nMTCT Mother-to-child transmission\n\nNGO Nongovernmental organization\n\nNIAID National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\nNIH National Institutes of Health (HHS)\n\nOAR Office of AIDS Research (HHS/NIH)\n\nPACHA Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS\n\nPAVE Partners in AIDS Vaccine Evaluation.\n\nPMTCT Prevention of mother-to-child transmission\n\nRFP Request for proposal\n\nSTD Sexually transmitted disease\n\nSTI Sexually transmitted infection\n\nTB Tuberculosis\n\nTRIPS Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Agreement)\n\nUNAIDS Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS\n\nUNDP United Nations Development Program\n\nUNGASS United Nations General Assembly Special Session\n\n\n\nUNHCR United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n\nUNICEF United Nations Children's Fund\n\nUSAID United States Agency for International Development\n\nUSG United States Government\n\nWFP World Food Program\n\nWHO World Health Organization\n\nWTO World Trade Organization\n\nSidebar 1: The Integrated HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment, and Care Model\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan is based on the established best practice of providing a continuum of care \nconsisting of a full range of integrated HIV/AIDS services. The availability of each of the continuum's activities--\nprevention, treatment, and care--strengthens and reinforces the effect of each intervention. Prevention activities \nsuch as HIV/AIDS education and awareness, behavior change, and testing are thus more effective when combined \nwith treatment and restorative or curative care, including such services as routine follow-up of HIV-infected \nindividuals prior to receiving antiretroviral therapy, control of symptoms, end-of-life care, and bereavement support. \nAll three interventions are mutually supportive, so that over time, as the availability of treatment (e.g., antiretroviral \ndrugs) grows under the Emergency Plan, the need for palliative care will decrease.\n\nCare for orphans and vulnerable children is another critical component of the Emergency Plan. The strategy \nemphasizes mitigating the consequences of disease to this population and reducing their risk and vulnerability to \nHIV. The difficulties faced by children orphaned by HIV/AIDS represent some of its greatest short-arid long-term \nconsequences. In providing prevention, treatment, care, bereavement, and other support services to children, \norphan care further reinforces the synergies of integrated service delivery. Wherever appropriate, services for \norphans and vulnerable children will be linked to the health care and human services network.\n\nSidebar 2: Risk Elimination, Risk Reduction\n\nBasic public health approaches to disease prevention rely on both risk elimination and risk reduction. Risk \nelimination strategies are those that reduce exposure to disease, such as abstinence in the case of STIs. Risk \nreduction strategies are those that reduce the likelihood of transmission during any given exposure, such as the use \nof condoms or the provision of prophylactic ARV treatment for exposed newborns or health care workers.\n\nRisk elimination is a cornerstone of the President's Emergency Plan. Approaches that are directed to behavior \nchange, such as encouraging abstinence, testing, and faithfulness in sexual relationships, have proven to be \nsuccessful and will be expanded. Knowledge of HIV status, fidelity in marriage, and monogamy for the sexually \nactive are equally important goals of prevention programs.\n\nEvidence from Thailand suggests condom use is an important means of reducing, but not eliminating, risk. Working \nclosely with local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and prevention experts, condom programs \n\n\n\ntargeted to at-risk populations will be supported. In doing this, it will be important to disseminate clear messages \nthat support, rather than confound, a core risk elimination approach.\n\nSidebar 3: Violence Against Women and HIV/AIDS\n\nEvidence from Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia shows that violence against women is both a cause and \nconsequence of rising rates of HIV infection - a cause because rape and sexual violence pose a major risk factor for \nwomen and a consequence because studies have shown that HIV-positive women are more likely to suffer violence \nat the hands of a partner than those who are not infected. For many women, tear of sexual coercion and violence \noften precludes the option of abstinence or holds them hostage to their husband's infidelity. Through President \nBush's Emergency Plan, the U.S. Government will work closely with communities, donors, and other stakeholders \nto reduce stigma, protect women from sexual violence related to HIV promote gender equality, and build family \nskills in conflict resolution. The Emergency Plan will also support interventions to eradicate prostitution, sexual \ntrafficking, rape, assault, and sexual exploitation of women and children.\n\nSidebar 4: \n\nStigma against HIV and AIDS, real or perceived, is one of the most difficult barriers to overcome. It strengthens \nexisting social inequalities and prejudices, especially those related to gender, sexual orientation, economic status, \nand race. Fear of rejection by family, employer, or community causes many people to fear the stigma associated \nwith the virus more than the virus Itself. It may encourage people to ignore or deny their HIV status and make \nchoices that are not In their own or society's best interest. Among health workers, negative perceptions of people \nliving with HIV/AIDS can affect the quality of care they provide to patients suspected of HIV and cause those who \nneed services to avoid them for fear of disclosure.\n\nStigma and denial create barriers to prevention, treatment, and care that must be addressed. President Bush's \nEmergency Plan will act boldly to address stigma and denial through three operational strategies that:\n\n     *  Engage local and national political, business, community, and\n\n        religious leaders and popular entertainers to speak out boldly\n\n        against HIV/AIDS-related stigma and violence against women, to\n\n        promote messages that address gender inequality, to encourage men\n\n        to behave responsibly, to promote HIV testing, and to encourage\n\n        those found to be HIV positive to seek treatment;\n\n     *  Identify and build the capacity of new partners from a variety of\n\n        sectors to highlight the harm of stigma and denial and promote the\n\n        benefits of greater openness through community-and faith-based\n\n        organizations, private sector businesses, the entertainment\n\n        Industry, the public health system, and the national government; and\n\n     *  Promote hope by highlighting the many important contributions of\n\n        people living with HIV/AIDS, by providing ARV treatment to those\n\n        who are medically eligible, and by involving those who are\n\n        HIV-positive in meaningful roles in all aspects of HIV/AIDS\n\n        programming.\n\n\n\nFinally, efforts to address stigma and denial will seek synergies among the prevention, treatment, and care realms. \nThe hope offered by treatment is an effective tool to combat irrational fear of the disease and open up channels of \ncommunication within communities.\n\nSidebar 5: The Network Model\n\nThe strategy to achieve President Bush's Emergency Plan's ambitious goals focuses on improving health care \nsystem capacity to deliver effective and expanded HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care services. The focus on \nhealth care systems provides a base from which to rapidly expand essential services. Health care systems in the \ntarget countries, and indeed in much of the world, are currently organized around the concept of a \"network model\" \ncomprising central medical facilities, district-level hospitals, and local health clinics, supplemented by private, often \nfaith-based, facilities. This network concept of public and private health care institutions currently provides the \nbackbone design of health care delivery systems, and many of the focus countries - Nigeria, Uganda, and Haiti, for \nexample - have planned their HIV/AIDS strategies with networked health care systems as the foundation.\n\n  \u2022 \n\nThe current capacity of these existing health systems to deliver HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care services \nis limited, however, particularly in rural areas. The Emergency Plan, in accordance with national health and \nHIV/AIDS strategies and with the intent to build long-term sustainability, will strengthen linkages between central \nfacilities and international and private support to build the capacity of different network components and strengthen \nnetwork-wide linkages in order to more effectively deliver quality HIV/AIDS services to those who need them most.\n\nThe Emergency Plan, in support of national HIV/AIDS strategies, aspires to the goal of well-functioning, well-\nmanaged health care networks in which central medical centers and referral hospitals at the core of the network will \nhave an adequate number of health care professionals highly trained in all aspects of HIV/AIDS clinical and \nprogram management. These facilities must also have adequate physical infrastructure and research capabilities. \nThe central facilities will link through effective referral networks to a series of smaller regional hospitals and district \nfacilities down to community-level satellite clinics, mobile units, and community-based services. To reach even the \nmost rural areas, and to dramatically scale up access in the short term, community-based health care workers will \ndeliver essential supplies, including medications, to patients in their communities, as currently practiced in Uganda. \nNurses and community health care workers will be trained in routine care, symptom management, and monitoring \nfor treatment adherence, while highly trained doctors--currently in scarce supply--will use their expertise in \nspecialized and difficult cases. Doctors, for example, would periodically visit a community to evaluate patients \nidentified for advanced care by nurses and community health care workers.\n\nThe network ensures technical support and products flowing out from the center to facilities in the periphery that \nprovide care. Facilities and health workers within the network, in turn, identify and refer patients for higher levels of \ncare as needed. This might include HIV/AIDS patients exhibiting greater levels of complexity. Information systems \nlink all levels of the network with regular feedback loops, enabling both providers and health policymakers to make \ndecisions based on solid data. Finally, the system will employ relatively uniform HIV/AIDS treatment and care \nprotocols that are consistent with national strategies and guidelines.\n\nSidebar 6: Volunteers for Prosperity\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and many of its grantees will be participating in Volunteers for \nProsperity, President Bush's call to international service to engage the people of the United States as part of U.S. \nGovernment assistance programs that meet global prosperity needs. The Volunteers for Prosperity initiative is part \nof President Bush's USA Freedom Corps volunteer service initiative that encourages highly skilled and trained \nindividuals to volunteer with organizations promoting health and prosperity throughout the world. Volunteer service \nis a major component of the President's ongoing effort to involve all Americans in sharing compassion and skills \nwith others in their own communities and around the world.\n\n\n\nSidebar 7: Monitoring Resistance to Antiretroviral Drugs\n\nCareful monitoring of ARV treatment is essential to limit the development of resistant strains of the virus and ensure \nthe long-term durability of treatment regimens. Currently, only a few countries have the sophisticated laboratory \ninfrastructure, highly skilled laboratory staff, and rigorous health information systems necessary to support an ARV \nresistance monitoring program.\n\nPresident Bush's Emergency Plan will help build the capacity of focus countries to monitor resistance to ARVs at \nthe program level by providing technical assistance and training to upgrade laboratory capacity and strengthen \nmonitoring and evaluation systems. The Emergency Plan will work with the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices and its constituent parts, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, and other research organizations to ensure that surveillance and research are supported to help detect \nviral resistance to ARVs and better understand the determinants of resistance in local settings. These studies will \nhelp inform decisions and policies related to clinical care, program management, and drug procurement. Clinical \nand operations research will identify and test appropriate alternative approaches to sophisticated laboratory \nmonitoring of ARV therapy in resource-limited settings and increase understanding of ways to increase ARV \nregimen durability.\n\nSidebar 8: Meeting the Needs of Afflicted Families\n\nFamilies are the cornerstone of a strong society. Families with children are especially impacted by HIV/AIDS - when \nparents and children are sick, the ability to cope with the impact of HIV/AIDS is dramatically diminished. President \nBush's Emergency Plan will particularly focus on care, treatment, and prevention needs of families with children. \nMany of these families are, in fact, headed by children because parents are dead or sick. Best practices of \ncommunity support for these households will be identified and promulgated. Mothers and fathers caring for sick \nchildren are likely to be HIV-infected themselves and will be encouraged to be tested and enter into life-sustaining \ntreatment, Home-based care and support programs will be especially targeted to such families in order to do all \nthat is possible to keep them, in tact and organizations with particular expertise in family care will be targeted for \nfunding.\n\nSidebar 9: SPECIAL FOCUS: The Global Fund\n\nOn May 11, 2001, President George W Bush, flanked by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Nigerian \nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo, made the first pledge to what would become the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria. The U.S. Government was a leader in the creation of the Global Fund as the \nembodiment of a new way of doing business, bringing together diverse partners, including the public and private \nsectors, donors and recipients, and NGOs and affected communities, to quickly and effectively mobilize resources \nfor combating HIV/AIDS and the other two diseases. The Fund's existence is based on strong public-private \npartnerships, results-based management, arid a focus on local capacity building.\n\nThe Global Fund is a private nonprofit foundation based in Switzerland, with a \"limited financial partnership\" board \nmodel that includes a balance between donor and recipient nations. In an arrangement unique among international \norganizations, the private sector has its own seat and vote, as do private foundations and \"northern\" and \"southern\" \nNGOs. The Fund has the potential to revolutionize the provision of assistance, and the United States is committed \nto the fulfillment of this vision and the Fund's full potential.\n\nThe United States leads the world in donations to the Fund, with $623 million in contributions to date and has \npledged a total of $1.97 billion from the inception of the Fund through 2008 (with cumulative contributions not to \nexceed one-third of the total contributions to the Fund from fiscal years 2004 to 2008). The United States accounts \nfor 37 percent of total pledges and 29 percent of contributions to the Fund, Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Tommy Thompson was elected Chairman of the Fund's Board in January 2003, giving the US, \nGovernment a special leadership responsibility through January 2005, Secretary Thompson has traveled \n\n\n\nthroughout the world on behalf of the Fund, enlisting and engaging government, private sector, and NGO actors to \nsupport the Fund's efforts to combat global AIDS.\n\nOver the next five years, the United States will remain deeply engaged in working to ensure the realization of the \nFund's unique potential as an effective actor to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The United States \nwill:\n\n     *  Work to ensure the Fund maintains its unique public-private\n\n        character, with a strong arid active board and a secretariat\n\n        accountable to that board;\n\n     *  Support projects built on proven best practices that incorporate\n\n        the principles of results-based management and strong mechanisms of\n\n        accountability for both in-country and Fund project managers;\n\n     *  Work to ensure harmonization of reporting, monitoring, and\n\n        evaluation of projects;\n\n     *  Work to strengthen mechanisms that increase coordination of the\n\n        Fund's country activities with those of other donors;\n\n     *  Continue to strongly support the Fund's mandate of local capacity\n\n        building of governments, NGOs, and the private sector, with embassy\n\n        and in-country program support for the Fund to establish such\n\n        capacity where it does riot exist;\n\n     *  Continue its strong support for the concept of \"additionality\" for\n\n        Fund projects, so that the Fund acts in addition to (rather than\n\n        replaces) local and bilateral HIV/AIDS efforts; and\n\n     *  Strengthen efforts to coordinate with the Global Fund so that\n\n        in-country resources are leveraged to ensure that gaps in service\n\n        are met arid overlaps are minimized or eliminated.\n\nSidebar 10: The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator: A New Leadership Model\n\nThe US, Global AIDS Coordinator, Ambassador Randall L.
