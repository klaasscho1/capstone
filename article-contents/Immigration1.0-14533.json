{"title": "Norton Calls ID Markets Terror Magnet", "body": "\n Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton called yesterday for a congressional hearing on whether the sale of fake identification \ncards in Adams Morgan and other parts of the country could attract terrorists. \n\n\"My concern, as a member of the Select Committee on Homeland Security, is that flagrant and notorious fraudulent \ndocument markets will become magnets for terrorism,\" Norton (D-D.C.) said in a letter to Rep. Christopher Cox \n(R-Calif.), chairman of the committee, and Rep. Jim Turner (Tex.), the panel's ranking Democrat. \n\n\"Production and open vending of [fake] documents in the heart of the nation's capital is at best an embarrassment, \nat worst a security danger,\" she wrote. \n\nU.S. immigration authorities have cracked down recently on the notorious market along Columbia Road NW, where \nvendors for years have peddled fake Social Security cards, U.S. residency permits and other documents. Officials \nhave made nearly 50 arrests and seized more than 1,000 phony IDs since Operation Card Shark began in May \n2002.  \n\nBut the trade continues.  \n\nOn a national level, meanwhile, immigration officials have been so overwhelmed by new anti-terrorism tasks that \nthey have reduced the number of investigations into fake document rings, officials from the Bureau of Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement said. They said most purchasers of the fake cards were unauthorized immigrants hoping \nto use them to get jobs. \n\nNorton emphasized that she didn't think such immigrants were terrorists. But she said she is worried that the easy \navailability of phony IDs could be exploited.  \n\n\"It seems to me you can't have open-air document selling in the capital of the United States,\" she said in an \ninterview. \"You've got to show you can clean it up here. . . . That sends a mega-message to these markets, which \nobviously are across the United States.\" \n\nNorton noted in her letter that she had asked the federal government last year for $ 1 million to help eliminate the \nfake document trade in the District. The request was denied. \n\n\nVince Sollitto, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Committee, said he had not yet seen Norton's letter and so \nhad no response to the request for a hearing. But, he added, \"The issue of fraudulent IDs is one of great interest to \nthe committee, one we'll continue to examine.\" \n"}
