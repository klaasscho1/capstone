{"title": "FLORIDA TO SUE U.S. IN REFUGEE DISPUTE", "body": "\nFlorida is preparing a lawsuit against the Federal Government over its handling of Haitian and Cuban refugees in \nthe Miami area, Gov. Bob Graham announced here today.\n\nMr. Graham said that the state had retained a Washington law firm and had instructed it ''to file the lawsuit as soon \nas possible.'' While Mr. Graham has not disclosed details of a possible legal basis for his action, he indicated at a \nnews conference that it would concentrate on the handling of Haitians who arrive in south Florida by boat illegally \nalmost every day.\nFlorida'a Governor Bob Graham announces plan to sue Federal Government over Haitian and Cuban refugee \ndispute\n\nIn a typical case, Haitians who come here by boat are detained by the local authorities and are handed over to \nofficers of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, who take them to Krome North Detention \nCenter in Miami. There are reports that a number of Haitians evade arrest and detention.\n\nAccording to Mr. Graham, by placing about 1,500 Haitians at Krome North, the Federal Government has violated \nlaws under which the camp can hold only about 500 persons. The number at the center yesterday was 1,483, and a \nnew boatload was reported today.\n\n \n\n'Dumping' Without Sponsors\n\nAnother violation of state laws, Mr. Graham said, was the release from the detention center of Haitians who did not \nhave sponsors, ''in effect dumping them on the citizens of Greater Miami.''\n\nMr. Graham, a Democrat, said that his action against the Reagan Administration was not politically motivated. ''We \nhave been demanding solutions to the refugee problem for more than a year and all we have have had have been \nglaring examples of broken promises by Washington,'' he said.\n\nThe Governor also said that the state had paid over $30 million in medical and other expenses for some 15,000 \nCuban refugee children who came here by sea last year. He said the payments had been made ''without \nWashingon recognizing that this is a national problem and not that of this area or of the State of Florida.''\n\n''The people of Florida cannot be asked to bear this onerous burden while Federal officials continue to postpone \ndifficult decisions,'' he continued.  ''If the national Administration will not act on its own we will take legal recourse to \nprotect the rights of the citizens.''\n\n \n\n\nImmigration Report Awaited\n\nLast March, President Reagan appointed a panel to review United States immigration laws and to recommend \nchanges, especially regarding policy toward illegal immigrants. According to White House officials, the panel's \nrecommendations might be made public next week.\n\nIn Florida, above all in the Miami area, illegal migration has become one of the most acute social and political \nproblems. While no more new Cuban refugees have been arriving since last October, there has been no letup in \nthe arrival of Haitians.\n\nUnder the current regulations, most of the undocumented Cubans and Haitians are subject to exclusion \nproceedings and can be deported to the country of origin. But last month a Federal judge in Miami halted exclusion \nproceedings of undocumented Haitians and ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to hear their cases \nindividually rather than in groups and to allow them access to attorneys and competent translators.\n"}
