Welcome, everyone. The committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee \nof the Middle East and North Africa International Terrorism is meeting together today with the house committee on \nHomeland Securities Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism to hear testimony on the domestic and \nglobal threat of white national's terrorism. I want to thank my co-chair of today's hearing Intelligence and \nCounterterrorism Subcommittee Chair Max Rose. Thanks also to our Ranking Members Joe Wilson and Mark \nWalker. And I also want to thank the Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson and Ranking Member Mike \nRogers for hosting us in this really beautiful homeland security committee hearing room. And I especially want to \nthank our witnesses for being here with us today. I hope this will be a serious examination of the threats that we \nface here in the United States and overseas and the interconnectivity of these threats.  \n\nI will now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement. I will try to be brief as we have a lot to \ncover.  \n\nIn recent months and years, it's become apparent that white nationalist terrorism is a growing threat, both here and \nabroad, and in order to solve this problem, we must first identify it. Our government, intelligence services, and law \nenforcement agencies use multiple terms for white nationalist terrorism, including racially motivated extremists and \nwhite supremacist extremists, among others. And when my subcommittee held a hearing with the State \nDepartment's Counterterrorism Coordinator in July, he unable to call this challenge by its name, white nationalist \n\n\n\nterrorism. Tragically, this mounting threat reared its ugly head only three days later in the horrific attack in El Paso, \nTexas that killed 22 people. \n\nIn the last year, that led to other attacks at the (INAUDIBLE) Chabad of Poway, (PH) just north of San Diego, the Al-\nNur Mosque and the Lynnwood Islamic Center in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the Tree of Life synagogue in \nPittsburgh. These attacks were proceeded by, among others in 2017, white nationalist terrorists attacked at the \nIslamic Cultural Center of Quebec city that killed six, the 2015 terrorist attack at the Emmanuel African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church in Charleston that killed nine, and the 2011 attacks by Anders Breivik that killed 77 people \nprincipally at a political youth camp in Norway. \n\nWhile these acts of violence may appear disparate in random, the terrorist allegedly responsible for them \ndemonstrably drew inspiration for one another. They share an ideology that asserts, among other beliefs, that white \npeople and white identity in Western countries are under siege by massive waves of immigration from nonwhite \ncountries. White nationalists also perpetuate conspiracy theories that claim that Jews control industries, \ngovernments, and other organizations through shadow groups, which allegedly pose a threat to white civilization.  \n\nWhite nationalists claimed they are protecting the white race and will use any means necessary to defend it against \nthe supposed disposition. This ideology helps explain why their targets include a why array--a wide array of people \nfor Latins in Texas, to Jews in Pennsylvania, to Muslims in New Zealand, African Americans in South Carolina, and \nteenagers in Scandinavia.  \n\nThe Internet services as a platform for white nationalists to disseminate this twisted ideology and even it broadcasts \nthese attacks. Technology enables interconnectivity between decentralized white nationalists' terrorists, \norganizations and networks, and presents challenges to law-enforcement efforts to track, monitor, and disrupt plan \nviolence.  \n\nWhite nationalist's terrorism is a challenge to--to Democratic governance, and its inherence dispels principles \nantithetical to both pluralistic values and to American ideals. It's also clear that the U.S. government, including the \nState Department, is not doing enough to counter white nationalist's terrorism and attract the global nature of this \nthreat.  \n\nWe must learn more about how these movements recruit and radicalize and how they share ideas across networks, \njust as we seek to understand the interconnectivity of other threats. If we are to marginalize and isolate white \nnationalist terrorism, a whole of society's effort is required, one that encompasses civil society and the private \nsector as well as government.  \n\nThis hearing is a chance for our subcommittee to gain a greater understanding of how the domestic and \ninternational dimensions of white nationalist terrorism overlap, especially regarding ideology, motivations, uses of \ntechnology, radicalization, and recruitment. White nationalist's terrorism is not a democratic or republican problem. \nIt is not just a domestic threat or solely an international challenge. I know we all take seriously the need to combat \nwhite nationalist terrorism, and I hope that our discussion today will help inform future efforts to meet this growing \nglobal challenge. \n\nAnd I'm working with legislation to address our strategy to combat this threat that I hope, and I'm confident it can be \nbipartisan. I believe the insight and expertise of our witnesses will be an important contribution to our discussion \ngoing forward. I thank you for being here, and it's now my honor to recognize Ranking Member Wilson, for the \npurpose of making an opening statement. \n\nWILSON: Thank you, Chairman Ted Deutch, Chairman Max Rose and Ranking Member Mark Walker for calling \nthis joint subcommittee hearing today. There's no doubt that white supremacy extremism is a dangerous and \nhateful ideology, which must be addressed. In my capacity as the Ranking Member of the International Terrorism \nSubcommittee of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am particularly interested in hearing more about the \ninternational dimension of this troubling phenomenon.  \n\n\n\nFirstly, I'd like to learn more about the nature of this threat from our witnesses. How big of an international \npresence do white supremacy extremist groups have? How many international attacks of these kinds of groups \nclaimed? Another important question is the organizational structure of the threat. The Islamic extremist terrorist \nthreat that we have faced since September 11, 2001, appears to be much more organized in nature van the one \nthat we're discussing today. \n\nWhile lone-wolf attacks carried out by individuals radicalized by the ideology of Islamic extremist terrorists' groups \nhave increased in recent years, there's still the exception to the more traditional model of attacks directed by a \nterrorist group. However, when we look at international white supremacy extremism attacks, they appear to be lone \nwolfs inspired by perverted ideology. The terrorists who massacred 51 civilians at the Mosque Christchurch, New \nZealand in March, claimed to be inspired by the Norwegian attacker who killed 77 people in Oslo in 2011. The \nshooter who killed 22 people in August at the Walmart in El Paso, Texas allegedly claimed to have been inspired by \nthe manifesto of the Christchurch shooter. \n\nAdditionally, in some cases, it appears that the perpetrators of these attacks are inspired by a variety of hateful \nideologies, not just white supremacy extremism. For example, the murders in New Zealand and El Paso also were \ndescribed as eco-fascists. With these murderous acts are there bona fide linkages between the international white \nsupremacist extremist attackers? Is this a real united movement or deranged and dangerous individuals inspired by \ntoxic hate on the Internet?  \n\nAnd lastly, is this phenomenon as different enough in nature and structure from the current well-financed and \norganized Islamic extremist terrorist--terrorism threat that we face? Should we be approaching it in the same ways? \nShould we be using the same policy tools on problems that they could be fundamentally different? We are faced \nwith these critical questions. I look forward to hearing from witnesses today. And with that, I yield back the balance \nof my time. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Mr. Wilson. I now recognize Chairman Rose for the purpose of making an opening \nstatement. \n\nROSE: Thank you, Chairman Deutch, and--it's really great to have these subcommittees together today because \nwe can't afford to really deal with this issue in a silo anymore. So thank you again for setting this up. I want to also \nthank our great partners and--witnesses here today I look forward to hearing from you. Your work and the work that \nwe have seen thus far shows us that this white nationalist threat is a threat that cannot be ignored.  \n\nWhite nationalist terrorist have killed more people in recent years than any other type of domestic extremist. We \nalso know that 78 percent of extremist-related murders in the United States last year were attributed to those \nadhering to a white nationalist ideology. On a larger scale, you know we--we considered things as most likely threat \nand most dangerous threat. And the most likely threat from a terrorist perspective in America today is that of a self-\nradicalized lone gunman loan gunwoman, and I think I speak for all of us today, that we do not care which ideology \nthey ascribe, we just care whether it's an extremist and a global one or not.  \n\nWe have seen that this is also a problem spreading to--a broad to our allies. In April, the New York Times published \nan analysis showing that since 2011, approximately one-third of white extremist killers were inspired by attacks \nglobally. We saw how in attacking Norway inspired one at Christchurch, which--which inspired several here at \nhome.  \n\nUnsurprisingly, all this is also shed a light on the role of social media companies as a catalyst for the spread white \nnationalist propaganda, both here and abroad. No longer can we look at these companies as exciting new unicorn \ncompany started by teenagers and hoodies. They are large global firms akin to General Motors, and I'm sick and \ntired of hearing them brag about success rates in and around 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent as it pertains \nremoving extremist content. If an auto company bragged about 70 percent of their airbags deploying, we would not \nthink that that was satisfactory. \n\n\n\nThis threat knows no boundaries. It doesn't end at traditional borders, and it tears across continents. As elected \nofficials, I think our number one priority is public safety and that--that's why I'm so proud that we are all focusing on \nthis today. We have to make sure that the federal government is working better at data provision. Right now, the \ncapacity of the government to provide high level an--analytics on the white nationalist threat, the white extremist \nthreat, and domestic terrorism is not nearly satisfactory.  \n\nWe also have to take into account that local law enforcement is now in the intelligence-gathering business and the \nterrorist prevention or terrorism prevention business. I believe that the NYPD has done an extraordinary job in this \nregard, and we have to make sure that those lessons learned are supported for other law enforcement agencies \nthroughout the country. \n\nLastly, and I--as I have said before, we have got to hold technology companies to a standard and I look forward to \nhearing your thoughts about how through public-private partnerships, we can hold them to a standard without--and \ndo that in a constitutional--constitutional manner. You know this is a--we--we have set a framework for the last 20 \nyears or so about what we should do in regards to jihadist-inspired global extremism, and now it is time for us to \napply that framework in a responsible manner to this new threat that we--that we face.  \n\nWe have got to consider how the State Department should expand force terrorist organization list to include these \nviolent international white supremacist groups. Today if an American citizen swears allegiance to--to ISIS or another \nFTO and spreads their message of terror, there are several insignificant resources available to the federal \ngovernment and their significant consequences for those actions. However, if that same American citizen swears \nallegiance to a white supremacist group based overseas and spreads their message of terror, the federal \ngovernment does not have access to those same tools, and that is just plain and simple wrong.  \n\nSo I look forward to hearing your opinions today in regard to the issues that I brought up. And with that, I thank the \nwitnesses and the members for being here today, and I look forward to making progress on this important issue. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Chairman Rose. I'll now recognize Ranking Member Walker for the purpose of making an \nopening statement. \n\nWALKER: Thank you much, chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing. This week \nmarks 56 years since the vicious murderers of Addie May Collins, (PH) Cynthia Morris Wesley (PH), Kale \nRobberson (PH), and Carol Denise McNear (PH) at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan at the 16th St. Baptist Church in \nBirmingham, a place where I was there earlier this year honoring those lives. Over half a century later, we are still \ndealing with hatred, racism, and violence. There is no doubt that we must do more to counter these threats. The \nunfortunate reality is that no city in the United States is immune.  \n\nOn August third, the country was horrified by a domestic attack at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, where the \nkiller was directly all target--targeting immigrants and killed 22 innocent people and wounding 24 more. The very \nnext day, a young man obsessed with violence and reportedly fueled by drugs carried out a deadly attack on a \npublic street in Dayton, Ohio, killing nine people and wounding another 27 others.  \n\nSeveral other attacks were reportedly disruptive through good police work and alert family members reporting these \nconcerns. We must not forget the other domestic terror attacks over the past few years, target--targeting radical and \nreligious groups, including the Tree of Life synagogue, Chabad of Poway synagogue, and the Emmanuel African \nAmerican Methodist Episcopal church.  \n\nIn June, we passed the three-year anniversary of the attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. And \nDecember will be four years since the San Bernardino attack. Also, this past June, at least 11 people injured during \nan Antifa rally in Portland, Oregon and the next month and inherent to the same ideology targeted a Department of \nHomeland Security facility in Washington state. \n\nThe broad range of ideology to base hatred and societal obsession with violence has left scars across our country. I \nfully support an open and bipartisan discussion about the domestic, hateful ideologies, and recommendations for \n\n\n\naddressing such threats. I am concerned about reports of global interconnectedness of the United States-based \ndomestic extremist and those overseas who share the same views. The far-reaching ability of jihadists to inspire \nand radicalize from their overseas safe havens have resulted in several hundred Americans going overseas to join \ntheir ranks or seek to carry out their attack in our homeland.  \n\nAre we seeing these same trends develop with domestic extremists? While current data is not showing the same \nthreat level, there are dangerous similarities between jihadist propaganda and the manifestoes posted by domestic \nextremists. I think it is important to hear from the intelligence community and federal law enforcement to get a full \npicture of the threat stream.  \n\nBefore closing, I do want to raise a concern that today's hearing was scheduled with very little advanced notice to \nthe minority side. That is not how the committee on homeland security has worked in the past, especially the \nsubcommittee and I hope this is an anomaly and going forward the majority will work in good faith to provide more \nnotice, particularly on hearings and roundtables related to such important things like threats to our homeland. I look \nforward to the testimony today, and I yield back. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank--thank you, Mr. Walker. Without objection, all members may have five days to submit statements, \nquestions, and extraneous materials for the record, subject to the length, limitations, and the rules. \n\nIt's now my pleasure to introduce our witnesses. Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss is professor of education and sociology \nand the director of research at the Center for University Excellence at the American University in Washington DC. \nShe has spent two decades researching radical and extreme youth culture in Europe and the U.S. She also writes \nwidely on school-based responses to rising hate. She's a prolific author, and researcher, and is a senior fellow at \nthe Center for Analysis on the Radical Right. Previously, she taught at New York University, the University of \nMaryland and the University of Michigan, where she also received her Ph.D. and two master's degrees. \n\nMr. Christian Picciolini is an award-winning television producer, a public speaker, author, peace advocate, and a \nformer violent extremist. Christian's involvement in and exit from the American White Supremacist Skinhead \nMovement is chronicled in his memoir White American Youth. He now leads the free radicals project, a global \nextremism prevention and disengagement network and has helped hundreds of--individuals leave hate behind. He \nalso has a forthcoming book Breaking Hate: Confronting the New Culture of Extremism. \n\nAnd finally, Dr. Sharon Nazarian is senior vice president of international affairs at the Anti-defamation League \nwhere she had the ADL's work fighting anti-Semitism and racial hatred globally, including overseeing ADL's Israel \noffice. She is also president of the Philanthropic Younes Nazarian Family Foundation, the founder of the Younes \nNazarian Center for Israel Studies at UCLA and chair of its advisory board and member of the--of the Council of \nforeign relations. She received her BA, MA, and Ph.D. from the University of Southern California.  \n\nThanks to all of you for being here today. Let me remind the witnesses to please limit your testimony to five \nminutes, and without objection, your prepared written statements will be made part of the hearing record. Thank you \nso much for being here today. And Dr. Miller-Idriss, we would start with you because you are--of where you're \nsitting and because you hold so many degrees from the University of Michigan. You're recognized. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Thank you. Chairman Rose, Chairman Deutch, Ranking Member Walker, Ranking Member \nWilson, members of the committee. I'd like to thank you for your service to this country and for calling attention to \nthe critical threat from global white nationalist terrorism. I'm honored to be here.  \n\nToday's focus is on white nationalist terrorism, which I view as a subset of the broader phenomenon of white \nsupremacist extremism. I will use both terms interchangeably to refer to an ideology that calls for lethal and mass \nviolence as a solution to the supposed existential threat, posed to whites from demographic change and \nimmigration. The growing global threat of white nationalist terrorism and white supremacists' extremism is well \ndocumented.  \n\n\n\nWhite supremacist extremism is currently the most lethal form of extremism in the U.S., causing at least 50 deaths \nin 2018. My written testimony documents rising trends in several areas' numbers of hate groups, propaganda, \nrecruiting efforts, hate crimes, domestic terrorism arrest, and mass shooting plots.  \n\nIn my oral remarks, I'd like to focus on how we should understand white nationalist ideology, it's growing global \ninterconnections, and what kinds of strategies might help address it. White nationalism is a global ideology. It \nintegrates racist and exclusionary beliefs with two core ideas, which both rely on mass violence as a solution. The \nfirst is the idea of a great replacement or white genocide, which is based on a paranoid belief in an orchestrated \ninvasion of immigrants, Muslims, or Jews who will eradicate or replace whites.  \n\nThese scenarios call whites to urge into action with appeals to protect and defend against a shared global threat \nof immigration and demographic change. They have inspired mass terrorist violence in recent years in Oslo, \nPittsburgh, Christchurch, Poway, El Paso, and more. White nationalist terrorist believes that the only way to prevent \nthe ultimate genocide of white populations by nonwhites is through an apocalyptic race war, which will result in a \nrestored white civilizational rebirth.  \n\nAlthough there are important differences between Islamist and white supremacist extremism, there are striking \nsimilarities to the Islamist extremist effort to restore the caliphate. In this sense, Islamist and white nationalist \nterrorists share a similar apocalyptic vision and use similar violent strategies to get there. \n\nWhite nationalist terrorist not only believe that a violent apocalypse is coming, but also that the fastest way to reach \nthe phase of racial rebirth is to accelerate the path to a new white civilization by speeding up polarization and \nundermining social stability. Violence is foundational to this approach because violent acts create immediate \nsocietal panic, inspire copycat actors, and encourage reciprocal revenge terror attacks. For this reason, each \nviolent act of terror is viewed as heroic, celebrated globally, and is understood to bring the movement one step \nfurther towards societal collapse and a new white civilization.  \n\nYouth are attracted to this ideology, in part, for how it channels grievances and personal trauma until anger, blame, \nand resistance, but also because it offers a sense of meaning, purpose, and way to engage heroically with a \nbrotherhood of warriors who seek to save the white race from an imminent threat.  \n\nWhite nationalist are globally interconnected in at least five expanding areas, increasing crowdsourcing online, \nenabling more fundraising, and growing financial interconnections. Increasing sharing of tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures or TTPs for attacks and other support activities can potentially contribute to even more attacks. \nIncreased cross-national recruitment for combat, so Ali Soufan testified earlier this month that over 17,000 fighters \nfrom Western countries, including many from the U.S., have traveled to Ukraine to fight, mostly for white \nsupremacist groups. Increased sharing and manifestoes and livestream attacks driving more inspiration from \nterrorist attacks globally and increased global gateways to extremist youth scenes that help build more networked \nrelationships.  \n\nSocial media, and online relationships, modes of communication are key to supporting all five of these global \nstrategies and are essential to the radicalization pathways of youth. White nationalist terrorism will almost certainly \ncontinue to get worse. We face a highly contested election season, growing disinformation campaigns, increasing \nmigration flows, and a social media landscape that enables hate to grow and thrive.  \n\nThere are steps that Congress can take to address this growing threat. We need improved interagency \ncoordination, a rethinking of the division between international and domestic terrorism and pass for cross-national \ncollaboration with our allies. The federal and local law enforcement need resources and direction. We need \nimproved national research capacity and expertise. And we need pathways to support local community \nengagement, communication, and preventative education for the safety and security of our nation, but also for the \nwell-being of all youth, families, and local communities you represent. I urge this Congress to act to prevent violent \nterrorist attacks and help interrupt radicalization pathways before they begin. Thank you. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Dr. Miller-Idriss. Mr. Picciolini.  \n\n\n\nPICCIOLINI: Thank you, Chairman Deutch, Chairman Rose, Ranking Member's Wilson, and Walker, and \ndistinguished members of this vital committee, both vital committees, and institution. I'm honored by your invitation \nto testify today. I also want to acknowledge that I am privileged to be here, considering my past.  \n\nI am a former extremist. In 1987, I was recruited into America's first neo-Nazi skinhead group. And at 14 years old, \nbecame one of the youngest and earliest members of what was then a fringe hate movement. For the next eight \nyears, I recruited other vulnerable youth, acting as a mouthpiece for hate, and wrote racist music that I performed \nfor thousands of white supremacists across the United States and Europe.  \n\nI rose quickly through the ranks to become a leader of the same white nationalist movement that 30 years later on \nAugust 12, 2017, marched in Charlottesville, chanting, \"the Jews will not replace us\" and killed a young woman \nnamed Heather Heyer. I escaped extremism in 1996, through the compassion of people I least deserve it from \nblack, and Latin Americans, Jews, people from the LGBTQI community, and Muslims who brought back to \nhumanity.  \n\nAfter disengaging, I obsessed over how a typical middle-class teenage son of Italian American immigrant parents \ncould become a violent white supremacist who forged alliances overseas. To better understand my own \nradicalization, I went back in, this time to prevent others from venturing down the same dark path. The number of \nformer extremists I have helped disengage, formers as we're called, is now in the hundreds from around the world, \nincluding a return foreign fighter of the so-called Islamic State.  \n\nWhat I've learned over 30 years is that the United States is losing vital ground in a battle we have yet to \nacknowledge exists on some levels. Violence by white--white supremacists has skyrocketed in America. Data from \nthe FBI and groups like the Anti-Defamation League clearly document this disturbing trend, but the greater threat \nthat has gone largely unnoticed and challenged for decades is how the tentacles of American white nationalism \nextend far beyond our borders and into a deep network of global terror. \n\nAmerican white nationalist have spent decades building alliances with their counterparts overseas. They've \ndeveloped a sophisticated online presence and received material support from foreign allies through digital \ninfluence campaigns that directly bolster their narratives and propaganda and extend their reach. Like ISIS, white \nnationalists also distribute glossy print and an electronic propaganda and produce high-quality recruitment videos. \nThey trade in digital cryptocurrency, use social media and encrypted platforms to communicate, share ideas and \nresources, lure new sympathizers and plan attacks. This is just what's occurring online.  \n\nIn 2018, the FBI reported white supremacist from Scandinavia, northern Europe, and the United States were \ntraining as foreign fighters with foreign paramilitary groups like the neo-Nazi Azoff Battalion in Ukraine and in far-\nright partisan training camps in Russia. They inflict terror the same way as foreign terrorist groups, bombing \ngovernment facilities, planned interruption of critical infrastructure, using high-capacity military-style assault \nweapons against soft civilian targets, assassinations, and the use of vehicles to target crowds.  \n\nWe tend to view white nationalist attacks like those in Charleston or El Paso as isolated hate crimes, but I can't \nstress enough that this view is naive, and dangerous, and will continue to expose Americans until we acknowledge \nthat this threat is persistent and pervasive. White nationalism is a fast-growing global movement whose members \nare preparing for a coming, coming race war, while simultaneously trying to initiate one.  \n\nThe shooter in the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, earlier this year, posted a manifesto \nonline deeply aligned with the core ideas of American white supremacist leaders. Though he was a 28-year-old \nAustralian, in a video the attack of Ukrainian Azoff Battalion patch was visible on his body armor. This is just one \nexample of how international cooperation leads to a body count. There are dozens more deadly incidents that have \noccurred recently, right here at home. \n\nWhen we think of terrorism by the so-called Islamic State, we acknowledge the international dimensionality and \nforeign special interest that allow it to exist and grow. We must do the same when it comes to white nationalist \nterrorism as a matter of national security. Adequate terrorism laws already exist to thwart and prosecute terrorists \n\n\n\nas to plenty of capable and talented people who are ready to defend us from the threat of harm, but the current \ncounterterrorism mandate doesn't provide for the proper focus, resources, funding, or in some cases the correct \nholistic approach to effectively counter-extremism.  \n\nKeeping American safe requires a strategy that redefines the threats we face and must be a balanced, non-\npolitical, nonpartisan, and nondiscriminatory approach that recognizes violent nationalism as part of the global \nthreat matrix, but neutralizing violence is only half of the equation. Preventing radicalization in future generations of \nAmericans is also critical. Policy reform in a public health approach that protects those who are vulnerable to \nrecruitment and offer services to people who want to disengage will be the key to long-term success in countering \nviolence-based extremism.  \n\nI've submitted an expanded written statement for the record, including a video and I am at your disposal. Thank you \nvery much. I welcome your questions. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you so much for being here, Mr. Picciolini. Dr. Nazarian. \n\nNAZARIAN: Good afternoon Chairman Deutch and Rose, Ranking Member's Wilson and Walker, and members of \nthe subcommittees. My name is Sharon Nazarian, and I serve as senior vice president for international affairs at the \nAnti-Defamation League. It's an honor to appear before you today.  \n\nI'm here today to speak to you about the internationalization and increasing interconnectedness of white \nsupremacist ideology around the world, which aims to dehumanize, threaten, and eradicate whole communities. \nWhite supremacy is a transnational terrorist threat that has already begun to engulf us all. Of extremist related \ndomestic murders in the U.S. in 2018, ADL has determined that 78 percent were perpetrated by white \nsupremacists. The threat of homegrown terrorism inspired by Islamist extremist's propaganda remains clear and \npresent.  \n\nIn recent years, however, we have seen an increase in other types of violent extremism, and our government has \nfailed to take sufficient measures to also address this rising threat. While white supremacists use various \neuphemisms to describe themselves, including white nationalists, race realists, and identarian there should be no \nuncertainty that the perpetrators of these attacks and the ideological community that inspired them are hateful \nsupremacist.  \n\nOver the last pass--over the past eight years, more than 175 people have died at the hands of white supremacists \nworldwide. There is a through-line from Charlottesville, to Pittsburgh, to Christchurch, Poway, and El Paso. The \nChristchurch killer who slaughtered over 50 innocent people cited in as manifesto Dylann Roof, a Norwegian white \nsupremacist Anders Breivik, who had perpetrated their own white supremacist terror attacks in 2011 and 2015. The \nChristchurch shooter, in turn, was cited as an inspiration by attackers at Poway, El Paso, and an attempted \nshooting at a mosque recently and Norway.  \n\nIn a report ADL released today, titled Hate beyond Borders, that I have here with me, the internationalization of \nwhite supremacy, will detail this phenomenon. These findings are result are a collaboration that's unprecedented \nbetween researchers at ADL Center on Extremism and extremism researchers in five countries named the Amadou \nAntonia foundation in Germany, the community security trust in the UK, the Expo Foundation in Sweden, the \nObservatory of Political Radicalism in France, and the Never Again Association in Poland. The report chronicles the \ndeepening ties between extremists in Europe and their white supremacist counterparts in America.  \n\nThe Internet has increased the global interconnectedness of white supremacists, helping to accelerate their \nmovement's deadly impact. The Internet also offers community. While most extremists aren't affiliated with \norganized groups, online forms allow isolated extremists to become more radicalized and dangerous. The most \nextreme forms of online content thrive in unregulated message boards like HN, Gap, and Fortune, but larger social \nmedia--platforms need to remain vigilant as well.  \n\n\n\nThere's a lot more that the U.S. government can do to address this threat, and we must start with leaders using the \nbully pulpit. The president, cabinet officials, members of Congress must call out white supremacy at every \nopportunity and have a responsibility not to engage in scapegoating of vulnerable groups. We cannot say it enough \nthat America is no place for hate.  \n\nADL endorses several pieces of legislation that would help as well, including the Domestic Terrorism Prevention \nAct, the Data Act, the No Hate Act, and the Disarm Hate Act.  \n\nIn addition, Congress can strengthen laws against perpetrators of online misconduct and can encourage online \nforms to implement more robust governance against cyberhate.  \n\nFinally, Congress and the State Department should closely examine whether it would be appropriate and effective \nto sanction certain white supremacist groups operating abroad if they meet the State Department criteria for foreign \nterrorist organizations. Several countries, such as Canada and the UK, have already added specific violent \nsupremacist groups to their terrorism lists.  \n\nThank you for the opportunity to testify and for calling a hearing on this very important topic. We must act swiftly, \ndecisively, and comprehensively to counter this threat and prevent it from metastasizing. On behalf of the ADL, we \nlook forward to working with you, as you continue to devote your urgent attention to this issue. Thank you. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you so much, Dr. Nazarian. Thanks to all the witnesses for their testimony. We'll now move to \nmember questions under the five-minute rule. Chairman Rose will begin followed by Ranking Member Walker. \nChairman Rose. \n\nROSE: Thank you, Chairman Deutch. I--I thank you all for your testimony. I'd like to zero in on this issue of these--\nthe--the actual infrastructure of these global organizations. Can you speak to from both a training as well as \nideological communication? What do these organizations look like? Can you please include names? Can you \nplease include where they're based out of? How many countries there--you don't have to be that specific, but \nregions? And most especially, can you please note their similarities to organizations like ISIS and Al Qaeda, not just \nas they just now, but especially as they existed in the late 80s and 90s before they started attacking the West with \nlarge-scale attacks. Dr. Miller-Idriss, we'll start with you. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: First, I'd like to say thank you for your service to this country, and I appreciate that. This is a very \ngood question. I think--I'll speak primarily to the ideology and I will say I prefer not to name groups here, but I would \nbe happy to do that off the record, just I don't want to give any additional oxygen to groups that will celebrate that in \na video clip.  \n\nSo I do think that what we're seeing with ideology is organized ideology coming through recruiters, through social--\nplatforms like YouTube, which and they're getting around bans by using encrypted channels, so--so working very \ncarefully to avoid algorithms, avoid bans and then--but then sharing encrypted channel information so that young \npeople who view those can then go to encrypted channels to receive further ideological information.  \n\nWe know that there are training camps being run both in this you know overseas in this country. There are kind of \nmilitia trainings and--preparation in that way. And we know that--that they are working together in partnership to \ncrowdsource kind of funding sometimes for activities, funding for legal--for legal troubles that they get themselves \ninto and--and working in that way, kind of over--over the Internet to--to support each other.  \n\nROSE: Okay. Thank you. \n\nPICCOLINI: If I may, to add to what the doctor said, the tactics are similar. And first of all, when I was a 14-year-old, \nI didn't think I was joining a local group. I thought I was joining a global movement, so even 30 years ago, the idea \nof it being global existed.  \n\nVery quickly, I took my work overseas. I was in one of the first American neo-Nazi bands to leave the U.S. and \nperforming Europe's, so there was money and propaganda being traded even then, before the Internet. This isn't \n\n\n\nsomething new because of the Internet, but to point out a specific group called Adam Waffen division here in the \nUnited States, which is responsible for at least five members in the last two years, operates very much like an ISIS \nterrorist cell. They're anonymous. They don't necessarily know who each other are. They do train in what they call \nhate camps. There has been a hate camp in Virginia, where they train with paramilitary style weapons, also in \nNevada in the desert. And there is one being planned by a group that a splinter of Adam Waffen division that's \ncalled the base, which is a literal translation for Al Qaeda that is going to be training in Washington.  \n\nAs far as ideology, it is consistent globally. There is very little difference, if anything, between the groups that \noperate internationally and the groups that operate here, but I also want to make clear that it is less about the group \nstructure these days and is more about kind of what's being called the leaderless resistance. While the ideology \ncontrols what they're doing, there is no hierarchy in terms of structure for groups. So while we may see the group \ndynamic becoming less popular that--we shouldn't think that this is going away. \n\nROSE: Sure. \n\nPICCIOLINI: What's happening over the last 30 years, is that the strategic plan was to become invisible. We \nencouraged people in the late 80s and 90s to not shave their heads, to not wear boots so that they can blend in. \nThere was heat coming from law enforcement, and groups were being taken down, so they encouraged people to \ngo out and try and radicalize others without bringing them into a group structure.  \n\nROSE: Dr. Nazarian. \n\nNAZARIAN: So what I can tell you is that the level of cross-pollenization is huge. Structurally, in-person meetings \nlike conferences, rallies, music festivals have become even bigger, and you see presence of American white \nsupremacists in Europe and vice versa. We saw it at Charlottesville, that was a very clear--indicator for us, where \nwe saw the presence of European white supremacists at the Charlottesville rally.  \n\nOnline, what we're seeing as at--they're sharing podcast, gaming has become a huge platform. Something that \nmost legislators and social and others are not paying attention to, and I would say that messaging boards like I \nmentioned HN, Gap, these are places where as--a the different way that from ISIS and Al Qaeda were there's no \nreal physical place. This is a community that they belong to. This is truly a global effort, and it becomes a huge \nattraction point for disaffected men, youth-- \n\nROSE: Sure. \n\nNAZARIAN: Say that they feel that-- \n\nROSE: Thank--thank you for your testimony. I just do want to put it out there that in the coming days we will be \nsending or distributing a letter to the Secretary of State identifying specific white nationalists foreign terrorist \norganizations or organizations that we believe should be FTOs and I--I certainly would appreciate the support of my \ncolleagues here. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Chairman Rose. Ranking Member Walker, you're recognized. \n\nWALKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Miller-Idriss, I have a very important question too start with. I'm assuming \nby the colors that you are wearing today your allegiance would be Tara Penn more than Wolverine or is this just \nstrictly a coincidence? \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: (OFF-MIC) Well, I went to school at Cornelia--Cornelia, which is the big red as you know, so. \n\nWALKER: All right, fair--fair enough. We'll move on from there. To your knowledge, have foreign-based members of \nwhite supremacist groups traveled to the U.S. to meet with groups or individuals here? \n\n\n\nMILLER-IDRISS: We know that they have. Individuals have come to Charlottesville, and we also have very good \nevidence of individuals from the U.S. going to Europe. So yes, I think in both directions there's-- \n\nWALKER: So you do have some cases here or there that you--you're seeing this?  \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes.  \n\nWALKER: Okay, great. Thank you for answering that. Since the 911 terror attacks, the government and public has \npromoted the see something say something concept to help alert law enforcement two terror threats. It made the \nFBI testify that 50 percent of domestic terror investigations are open due to referrals from the public and other state \nand local partners. Do you have any recommendations to further improve the suspicious activity reporting system? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I think the hardest thing about that is that the people who are most likely know something are \npeers or other young people. And we also know that there the least likely to come forward. I think that public \neducation on that can go a long way. We have also seen parents in very recent years being a very good source of \ninformation, but I will say that one thing that we lack compared to Europe is that even when parents know \nsomething is going on.  \n\nThey don't know who to call. They're reluctant to call the FBI. They're reluctant to call the police. I would suggest \nthat if we had something like a suicide hotline number, a number--a phone number that parents could call that was \nto get information to--that you know we have resources, but parents who do fear that their--that their children are \nplanning something, do not know how to get help in a way that there--that they think will be useful. \n\nWALKER: Thank you. And Mr. Picciolini, if I have time and going to come back to you because I--I could tell that \nyou might want to add something there. Let me go to Dr. Nazarian if I could please. I believe you mentioned the \nnumber over eight years, 175 deaths internationally. What--is that--is that--did I get that number correct? \n\nNAZARIAN: Yes. \n\nWALKER: Okay so, that's--that's--and ones too many. 21 per year--it--it's--and--and I think part of what we're doing \ntoday is--is as much as the numbers we're trying to prevent the trend as well in that direction. Could you answer the \nquestion that I have for you, how many deaths over that same eight-year period of time has been due to religious \nzealots? Dr. Miller-Idriss mentioned that Islamists, some of the fundamentals there. Over that same eight-year \nperiod of time, how many murders, or death, or killings in that arena? \n\nNAZARIAN: I--I don't have that number in front of me, so I can't tell you exactly. But what I want to be very careful \nabout is this is not an either/or discussion. \n\nWALKER: No, no and I'm getting to that, but my--I had a specific question. So, you have no idea of that? \n\nNAZARIAN: I--I don't. I am happy to provide that to you in writing afterward. I don't have that number. \n\nWALKER: Dr. Miller-Idriss, would you have any idea on that number? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Not also with my--in my documents here. Not on top of me.  \n\nWALKER: Because ultimately were wanting to be able to deal with both, so I think both those are important. Should \nmaybe? You would agree with that?  \n\nNAZARIAN: Absolutely.  \n\nWALKER: According to CBS in 2017, they have a number of 84,000 that have been murdered, and I want to do \nsome kind of back up. I'm just coming up this number the last hour or so. I want to make sure that number is valid \nbut--but I just want to make sure that we are concerned about that. Let me have--I got a question. I've got time to \nget those in. Going back to Dr. Miller-Idriss, given the concerns are raised here today about domestic terrorism, \nspecifically white supremacy extremism. Do you have concerns about the ability of law enforcement to monitor \n\n\n\ndomestic terror threats in locations were cities have put out the FBI's joint terrorism task force or the JTTF? San \nFrancisco, Portland, and some others have pulled out, is that a concern for you at all?  \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I do have concerns about whether local law enforcement is adequately prepared, particularly \ngiven the evolving nature of the threat. The fact that the symbols have changed so much. The clothing has \nchanged. The signals have changed. I'm not sure that we really have awareness among local law-enforcement or \namong teachers, for example, who would also be useful. \n\nWALKER: Quick, yes, or no question. Do you find it difficult to potentially create policy that remains cognizant of the \nConstitution and the U.S. citizen's rights, while also enabling law enforcement to direct and prevent Americans from \nbeing radicalized the point of violence? Just--just for clarity. I know that's a struggle for us, sometimes liberty versus \nthe privacy and all that.  \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes, I think that is a very big concern, but I also think we have 20 years of experience now that we \ncan draw on and seeing how we've done that with the American Muslim community to see what's gone wrong, \nwhat's gone bold right and I would encourage us to think about that.  \n\nWALKER: And I want to honor my word that I try to get back in. Mr. Picciolini, would you mind addressing for us \nsome additional things that we can do from the question that I asked the doctor.  \n\nPICCIOLINI: Sure. And I just wanted to address that in my expanded statement I did name organizations that were \nglobal and domestic for that report. You know it's very difficult for--for peers to identify-- \n\nWALKER: I only have about 10 seconds, so I just want to honor to the rest of the members here, so-- \n\nPICCIOLINI: Sure. White supremacist have done a very good job of hiding themselves over the last 30 years. It's \nvery difficult to identify them. \n\nWALKER: Okay. All right. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.  \n\nDEUTCH: Thank--thank you, Mr. Walker. We are going to alternate between parties and between subcommittees. \nI'm going to defer for now and turn it over to Mr. Connelly.  \n\nCONNOLLY: I thank--I thank the chair and welcome to our witnesses. I think this is a very important and \nconsequential hearing because we are not giving this topic the kind of attention it most certainly deserves. Not to \nmake a point, but to frankly protect society and to expose what is truly a conspiracy that harms people, and as you \npoint out, Mr. Picciolini kills people. \n\nI'm from Virginia, and we saw the harm white supremacist can do in a peaceful university community that prides \nitself in being inclusive and accepting and diverse. And it was horrifying for all of us who know Charlottesville to \nwitness what took place because an outside group decided to make it an object lesson of their hate. So thank all \nthree of you for being here.  \n\nDr. Miller-Idriss, let me--let me just ask if you--not including 9/11, obviously. Terrorist incidents here the United \nStates--white supremacists have in the grisly count frankly been you know responsible for more deaths than \nanything associated with Jehovah's movements. Would that be a fair statement?  \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes, I believe that's a true statement in history. Yes. \n\nCONNOLLY: So, when we look at the resources the federal government has marshaled to deal with say a jihadist \nterrorist threat, they're considerable. Would that be a fair statement? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes, I believe they are considerable. \n\nCONNOLLY: In the tens of billions of dollars, maybe more? Now given the fact that the white supremacist terrorist \nthreat, depending on how you measure it, is certainly equal to if not greater than domestically the--the jihadist \n\n\n\nterrorist threat surely the resources devoted to addressing the white supremacists threat are comparable to those \nof the jihadist threat. Is that fair? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: The resource question is they are not equal resources. \n\nCONNOLLY: They are not equal? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: No. \n\nCONNOLLY: Would it be fair to say they are not even close? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: They are not even close. \n\nCONNOLLY: And are they are consequences that flow from that kind of disequilibrium in terms of the allocation of \nresources to the actual measured demonstrable threat, not the theoretical or fear-based threat. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes, there are consequences, and I will just say, this is from my written testimony, that the FBI \nhas testified that 80 percent of their agents focus on international terrorism, 20 percent on domestic. They were \nable to stop 70 percent of terrorist activities from Islamist groups in 2018, but only 29 percent of the white \nsupremacist attacks. \n\nCONNOLLY: And by the way, my friend was talking about religious zealotry versus something else, and but Mr. \nPicciolini, given your experience, would it not be fair to say many of the white supremacists consider themselves \nreligious, zealous, right. They're--they're promoting a certain culture, and ethos from their point of view. Is that \ncorrect? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Yes, sir. That is correct. \n\nCONNOLLY: It would not be a jihadist culture, but it would certainly be a radical and extreme version of their \nversion of Christianity in many cases. \n\nPICCIOLINI: That's correct. And also, in many cases, they refer to themselves as white jihadists.  \n\nCONNOLLY: So in the time I have left, after Mr. Chairman having established that there's this disequilibrium and \nresources devoted to the actual measured threat which I think the subcommittee deserves credit for having that \ncovered now, legislatively we'll address that. I'd like to give you an opportunity, Mr. Picciolini to talk a little bit about \nyour story. I mean would it be fair to say that what motivated you way back when to join these groups or associate \nwith them was maybe certainly two things. One was a sense of belonging, but the other was maybe fear and \ninsecurity.  \n\nPICCIOLINI: Yes, sir, thank you for the question. You know ideology is really secondary to becoming radicalized. \nAnd I say radicalization starts the day we're born. For me it was searching for a sense of identity, community, and \npurpose all three of which I felt I didn't really have a grasp on in my life. My parents are Italian immigrants who \ncame to the U.S. in the 60s, and as immigrants they had to work seven days a week, 16 hours a day, so I didn't see \nthem very much, growing up. I knew they love to me and they still you know do, but I didn't see them, so I went \nsearching for a family elsewhere and for a sense of agency and inclusion. I was idealistic as a--as a kid, but I \ncertainly wasn't mature enough to know that I was making the right or wrong decisions at that time. \n\nCONNOLLY: Am I up? Is my time up? \n\nDEUTCH: The gentleman's time has expired. \n\nCONNOLLY: I thank the chair, and I thank (INAUDIBLE). Thank you all for concurring to be here today. We really \nappreciate your testimony. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Mr. Connelly. Mr. Wilson, you're recognized for five minutes. \n\n\n\nWILSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank each of you for being here today. And Ms. Miller-Idriss, I particularly \nappreciate your comment about not identifying on particular groups to give them attention. I know that I was just \nmentioned to the chairman that I--I specifically never mention the name any of the mass murderers who have \nconducted their operations. I--I--they just should not be given personal recognition. It is--that's what they want.  \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I absolutely agree.  \n\nWILSON: And so, with that in mind, you know, do--how do we do identify? And for each of you, the different \nextremist groups and where are they located? What kind of membership do they have? And then--not long ago, we \nall faced a very identifiable hate group of the Ku Klux Klan. What is the status of the KKK? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: The KKK is thriving. As--as our other groups, we see also international I will say they're one of the \ninteresting things I've read recently showed that on when Facebook kicked the Ku Klux Klan off of Facebook, they \nmigrated to a Russian platform called VContacta (SP). And then in the Ukraine, there were 60 separate KKK \ngroups operating VContacta when the Ukraine banned that platform. And then they evolved, and those groups \ncame back to Facebook, some of them by using the Cyrillic letters. They got smarter, so you know it's--it's also an \nexample of a single platform banning doesn't always work. It can make the--the situation worse.  \n\nBut they are thriving. I think they're really good experts around in the U.S. and also in our ally--from our allies \noverseas who can--I can also meet off the record and can provide lists of groups and where they are. And I know all \nof us would be happy to do that afterward as well. \n\nWILSON: Thank you. Mr. Picciolini, do you have a comment on that? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Yes, thank you, Ranking Member Wilson. The groups really are everywhere, and it's less about the \ngroups than it is about the individuals and they are everywhere. I get requests, probably a dozen or so every week, \nfrom either people wanting to disengage from hate groups--groups or from white supremacy or from parents of \nchildren who were horrified that their kids are being recruited over video games, through the headsets playing \nmultiplayer online games, through the depression forums online, through autism forums where they are hunting for \npeople. Those are the types of tactics that groups like ISIS use as well.  \n\nBut there was a concern in strategy 30 years ago to really move away from the more visible elements of the \nmovement into a more mainstreaming of the ideology. We encouraged people to not look extreme. We wanted \nthem to go into things like the military to get explosives training, to join law enforcement, to run for office in some \ncases, and in some cases back in the 80s and 90s we were successful with that. This--the process was started in \nlate 80s with David Duke (SP) who removed his clan robe and was elected to the House of Representatives. That \nreally started the process of mainstreaming this ideology. And it's really taken on a life of its own since then. \n\nNAZARIAN: I'd like to add that we have to keep in mind that most of the most violent shooters do not belong to \nspecific groups. They are all lone wolfs, and they are radicalized, so it's important to keep in mind that they're--really \nthe most extreme ones are self-radicalized and that's why I want to bring attention to what's going on online. We at \nthe ADL have actually brought members of law enforcement from across Europe to our advanced training school \nthat we take--we do in--in Washington DC once or twice a year and we really train them, specifically about the \nsymbology, about what kind cross polymerization going, the ideology, but it's really the Internet where we think \nplatforms both mainstream and some of the ones I mentioned, and the gaming that I mentioned is the structures \nwhere we have to really look at. That's where they're meeting.  \n\nThat is the community that they come to and believe in and feel a part of this global movement. So if I can reiterate \none point, it's really about ourselves, the--the media companies, social media companies, the platform have to be \nresponsible in helping us collect data, understand where the threats are coming from. They are talking about things \nand they--they're being monitored, so we have DNA that we should be able to have more transparency towards and \nto be able to see through where our the threats coming from, and we just don't have that transparency right now, \nso I think--the platforms really have a role here to play. \n\n\n\nWILSON: Well, thank you to then for raising these issues. And we look forward to working with you in the future. \nThank you, Mr. Chairman. \n\nDEUTCH: I thank Mr. Wilson. Mr. Cicilline, you're recognized for five minutes. \n\nCICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses and thank you, Chairman, for this really \nimportant and very sobering hearing. I want to just ask Dr. Miller-Idriss, you--you made reference in your written \ntestimony that white supremacist extremism is the most lethal form of extremism in the United States right now with \n50 deaths in 2018. The fourth deadliest year since 1970 that groups are at a record high, white nationalist groups \nincreasing by 50 percent--50 percent in 2018.  \n\nAnd so, I guess my first question is, while we have to think about how do we protect the American people and be \nsure law enforcement has the resources and I'm interested to speak to Mr. Picciolini about ways to disengage \npeople. And I guess the first question I have is, are there--is there research that shows like what is causing this? \nThis is a significant increase, and it seems to me understanding what are some of the causes of this that we might \nprevent would be a very efficient way to start thinking about responding to this challenge. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yep. That's a great question, I think. What we know is that young people, especially I mean it's \nnot only young people but young people, especially have a--have a set of grievances that relate to--that are--that \nare--then can be weaponized through online culture. They relate to a sense of feeling insecure, feeling excluded, \nfeeling economically marginalized. We call it aggrieved entitlement, a sense that they deserve something better \nthat they didn't get.  \n\nAnd then online, they meet these narratives that tell them you know that there's a pathway for you to make a \ndifference, to be a part of something bigger and better than yourself, to enact a sense of meaning, to be a hero, and \nalso a place to express anger. And we know that anger and rage is part of it as well, but it--but I think those \nemotional--and I really want to second what--what the Christian said that these emotional underpinnings are the \ndraw, and then the ideology comes second. And so when we think about preventative work, we have to think about \nwhat it takes to offer young people places to enact meaning, places to be a hero, places to engage meaningfully in \na moment where they are more isolated than we've ever seen young people before. \n\nCICILLINE: I was a Mayor before I came to Congress, and that was very much the conversation we had in \nresponse to gang violence. The same ideas sort of connecting to something and being a part of something often \nreplacing a family organization that didn't exist.  \n\nBut you made reference I think Dr. Nazarian to the technology platforms and I'm just wondering whether--what the \npanelist think that the technology companies should be doing in terms of identifying threats, alerting government \nauthorities, possibly banning or removing content. It feels like that one of the really big challenges here is that ease-\n-that ease in which information is shared, misinformation, this ideology quickly with lots of people and is it time to \nimpose a greater responsibility technology platforms should play a more active role in this space? \n\nNAZARIAN: If I could add, I mean just in going back to the eye and the things that are adding to the--the sensitivity \nof youth. You know, even concepts like globalization, multiculturalism, what they're calling third worldism. Why is \nthere such a reaction to nonwhite immigration to America? It's really this notion that whites are being replaced.  \n\nAnd what I can tell you from my travels around the world, especially to Europe is that Europe serves as a cautionary \ntale. American white supremacist are looking at in Europe, seeing the influx of Muslims because of the Syrian war \nand the Iraqi war, looking at coming--migrants coming in from Africa and they are being replaced. And their purity \nand the white race that they believe in is being invaded and being disseminated so that--that's first and foremost we \nhave to keep in mind the connectivity of these threats and how they see it, so Europe services that.  \n\nGoing now to the platforms, we talk about the responsibility of platforms to self-govern. They know how to do it. \nThey're just refusing to do it right now. And it takes all of us our legislators, the private sector, NGOs like us to bear \n\n\n\npressure to say you cannot only react after things happen after horrific acts happen. You have to be able to do it \nbeforehand and help us to do together through gathering data and others.  \n\nCICILLINE: Yeah. And I also think it's obviously not helpful when we have political or civic leaders in the country \nthat are using language that dehumanizes refugees or immigrants and speaks about invasions and infestations and \nall that kind of stuff. I just have a minute left, so I'd like to ask each of you. What's the one most important thing \nCongress can do right now to respond to this urgent challenge? Dr. Miller-Idriss, start with-- \n\nPICCIOLINI: Sorry, you know I would say we really need to treat this in two ways. One is a national security issue, \nbut also as a public health crisis. The way to tackle deradicalization is in a public health because ideology really is \nsecondary. People find their way to the ideologies, and it becomes the green light to be angry or the permission \nslip. So, if we want to solve this for future generations, we really need to focus on social services, early childhood \neducation, and mental health care. \n\nCICILLINE: Thank you. Dr. Miller.  \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: If I could pick one thing, I would urge you to--to think long-term about capacity building and \nexpertise. And I would just say that you know the reason why I'm here today is because this government invested in \nme. It funded me to go to graduate school. The Javits Fellowship paid with the National Science Foundation, title VI \nmoney, title VIII money. All of my graduate school was funded through the act of you know acts of this government \nto fund me. It took 22 years for that expertise to come back to this room and help, I hope in this way, but so it's a \nlong game to invest in that way, but I hope that those investments pay off over time. And I think that we had--we \ncan't just think of this is a short-term you know how to shuffle money around and get immediate expertise on a kind \nof a whack a mole type of the way. We have to think long-term about what capacity might we need 20 years from \nnow to solve whatever terrorist threats exist then. And I hope that long-term investments can be made. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Dr. Miller-Idriss. I think we feel good about the investment that was made. \n\nCICILLINE: Absolutely. \n\n(LAUGHTER) \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Thank you. \n\nDEUTCH: Mr. Zeldin, you're recognized \n\nZELDIN: Thank you to the chairs for hosting today's hearing. This is an important conversation for us to be having \nin Congress. I appreciate the witnesses for being. In our country, the way that we define word, terms are important \nto help us to talk to each other as opposed to past each other. I know that the ADL has definitions for the term's \nwhite nationalism, white supremacy. I don't know if all three witnesses agree with those terms as defined ADL or if \nyou had any other definition? To Dr. Miller or Mr.-- \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I prefer the term white supremacist to extremism myself. As a--as the broadest overarching term, I \nthink that white nationalism is a term that can soften the impact and that has also been used to deliberately, \ninternally to kind of soften it by making it seem as if this is overblown patriotism, but I also think that it's not a good \nexercise in general for scholars or policymakers to spend too much time fighting over terminology and--and--and \ngetting too caught up in those debates. I think that if we know what we're talking about and we can agree to \ndisagree on the terminology. \n\nZELDIN: But generally, do--I guess the question is if you agree with the ADL definition? I was in asking for you to \ndisagree and less you--I mean I guess you do.  \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yeah, right, sorry.  \n\n(LAUGHTER)  \n\n\n\nPICCIOLINI: I don't know the exact definition but generally having done a lot of work with the ADL-- \n\nNAZARIAN: I have them. Yeah, happy to share.  \n\nZELDIN: Dr. Nazarian, please.  \n\nNAZARIAN: So, the ADL defines white supremacy*** as the collection of movements sharing one or more of the \nfollowing key tenants.  Number one, white people should have dominance over people of over ethnic and racial \nbackgrounds, especially in places where they may coexist.  Two, white people should live by themselves in whites \nonly society.  Three, white people have their own culture that superior to other cultures.  And four, white people are \ngenetically superior to other people.  So, they believe that the white race in danger of extinction due to a rising flood \nof non-whites, as we talked a little bit about their concerns.   \n\nPICCIOLINI: I would agree with that. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I agree. \n\nZELDIN: I wasn't trying to provoke a disagreement.  \n\nWhat's interesting in our country is the term, nationalism gets discussed as well.  And used with a different definition \nof white nationalism.  Any of you want to offer a definition of what nationalism is? \n\nPICCIOLINI: I would say that, white supremacists have always tried to find softer marketing terms and buzz words.  \nWhite nationalist, alt-right are their terms to make them seem less racist.  But, if I were to define nationalism, I \nwould say, that the difference between nationalism and patriotism is being proud of your country, and being a \npatriot means you want share that with other people.  While being nationalist means you want to exclusive and not \nreally share those resources or talents with others. \n\nZELDIN: Does the ADL have a definition for nationalism?  I don't know the answer for that. \n\nNAZARIAN: I don't believe so, not that I'm familiar with.  But, I think, I mean in general of love for country, I think as \nMr. Picciolini referenced, is one that you share a pride versus one that is exclusionary and is against the interests of \nothers.  So, it's much more exclusionary feeling. \n\nZELDIN: You know, it's interesting, social media cuts both ways, especially anonymously you could say--I mean the \nlowest common denominator of the way either your internal compass is, or you view others, people can be the \nworst forms of themselves anonymously.  Some people have, I've seen on social media, declared themselves \nnationalists.  And then when you look at the way they're commenting on issues, they don't seem to meet the \ndefinition white supremacy or white nationalism.  People who are saying that they're nationalists--so, it's interesting.  \nOne definition that gets used, identification with ones own national and support for its interests, especially to the \nexclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations.   \n\nAnd what's interesting about this widely used definition for nationalists is that people then see the definition and \nthen they call themselves a nationalist.  Not that they are excluding a specific person based off of race, or religion, \nthat they believe that are supporting their country, and saying that we should prioritize our own interests over \nothers.  And if that person is white, then they called a white nationalist and then they end being called a white \nsupremacist.  It's just very interesting what I've seen on social media where people are declaring themselves to be \nnationalists, but they don't seem to be violent.  They don't seem to have--express any type of hate toward people of \nother races, religions, genders, and that list goes on.   \n\nBut I appreciate taking the time.  This is something that's hard to justice for in five minutes.   But, you know, our \ncountry on this topic does need to do a better job communicating with each other to make progress.  And once \nagain, thank you to the Chair's for hosting today's hearing. \n\nDEUTCH: Mr. Malinowski, you're recognized for five minutes. \n\n\n\nMALINOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   \n\nA couple of issues I wanted to ask you all about.  The question of whether we should be designating groups as \nterrorist organization often comes up.  And it's, I think understandably very controversial with regard to domestic \ngroups, even if they have international connections.  But I wanted to ask you in particular about the practical merits \nor disadvantages of designation of foreign based white supremacist terrorist organizations.  What--would there be \npractical benefits?  Is that something that you would recommend?  If not, why not? \n\nNAZARIAN: If I may respond?  We had the idea and are looking at that question right now.  And what we can say \ntoday that we really encourage both the State Department and Congress to seriously examine that question.  We \nthink its worthy of examination.  We know, as I mentioned in my testimony, Canada and UK have done so.  And I \nthink it's really warranted to look at it closely and make sure that the designations fit the criteria the State \nDepartment's already set up. \n\nMALINOWSKI: Right.  So, it could prohibit material support.  It would potentially help our law enforcement agencies \ntrack movement of people fighting for an organization based in Europe, tools that don't really exist right now.  Ok. \n\nLet me--a separate issue that Chairman Rose also mentioned.  Others referred to as the whole problem of online \nradicalization.  When we talk about this problem and the role that the social media companies play, we generally \nfocus on deleting that content and removing bad people from the online platforms.  I think its partly because we all \nunderstand that, you don't need technical expertise to understand the importance of getting rid of something that's \nbad.  But it's also whack a mole.  I doubt we'll ever get to 100 percent, given the billions of people who exist on \nthese platforms.  There are new platforms that people move to. \n\nThe question that I have been thinking about much more is not just what to do about bad content, but what to do \nabout the engine that promotes that bad content.  If somebody goes on the Daily Stormer website or watches some \nAzat(SP) Brigade videos, what's likely to happen on their YouTube feed?  What are they going to start seeing? \n\nNAZARIAN: Recommended content. \n\nMALINOWSKI: Recommended content.  Now the social media companies argue, I think understandably, that they \nare not liable for the content that we post.  If I libel you on Facebook, I'm libel for that not Facebook.  But, would you \nagree that if Facebook or YouTube or Instagram is promoting content, writing an algorithm that causes that content \nto show up in my social media, because they have guessed that I might be interested it, that they are in fact more \nlibel than they would be for the creation of the content itself?  And should we do something about that? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I believe that the recommender systems and the algorithms are a huge problem, and that we \nneed pressure on these companies to make changes.   \n\nMALINOWSKI: And what changes would you suggest that they make?  And what sorts of pressure?  Should we, for \nexample, look at Section 230 with regard to immunity for at least algorithmically promoted content? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: So, some of what--I mean, for example, Dylann Roof has been very clear about how he--his \nradicalization pathway starting with a Google search.  And Google had made changes in the way that those \nsearches work without actual legislative pressure.  But, if those kinds of changes don't come about, I think we need \nlegislation that would pressure it. \n\nMALINOWSKI: Would you agree? \n\nPICCIOLINI: I would agree.  I think these companies are a lot like countries where they have the GDP and the size \nof you know, bigger than most countries.  But I also want to caution that these groups, these individuals in the \nextremist movements, move so fast that it's difficult to from one day to the next know what exactly what they're \ndoing without a focus.   \n\nMALINOWSKI: Right. \n\n\n\nPICCIOLINI: You know, I think that the technology companies do have a responsibility in terms of the algorithms \nthat are promoting this radicalizing material, absolutely. \n\nMALINOWSKI: One final question.  You spoke, Dr. Miller-Idriss about the--the anti-immigration aspect of the \nideology.  And obviously, immigration policy it's something we all debate, we have very different views, legitimate \ndifferent views.  Should we build a wall, not a build a wall, boarder security, immigration reform, but setting aside \nthose legitimate differences, should any politician, candidate, office holder, use the phrase, immigrant invasion? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: No, they should not. \n\nPICCIOLINI: 25 years ago I wrote a song about immigrant invasion that years later Dylann Roof posted the lyrics to \nonline.  And I was just an insignificant 17-year-old skinhead at the time.  So, certainly people with responsibility for \ntheir words have a more of a responsibility. \n\nMALINOWSKI: That is the rhetoric of terrorism, would you agree? \n\nNAZARIAN: Absolutely. \n\nMALINOWSKI: Thank you.  I yield back. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Mr. Malinowski.  Ms. Jackson-Lee, you're recognized. \n\nJACKSON-LEE: Let me thank all of you for your presence.  Mr. Chairman, thank you, Chairman persons plural, for \nthis kind of meaningful and potent meeting. \n\nLet me ask each of you on a yes or no.  Do you consider racism, like nationalism, a national security threat?  Each \nwitness just answer yes or no. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes. \n\nPICCIOLINI: Yes. \n\nNAZARIAN: Yes. \n\nJACKSON-LEE: One of the best feelings that I've had is--I'll give two, I know my time is running.  One was in high \nschool with my best friend who happened to be white and Jewish.  I guess I just saw him in his role as a fellow \ntraveler.  It was a good feeling.  I guess we had to do it scientifically, there were good feelings out of that friendship.  \nWe liked the same things, we liked student government.  And so good things always seemed to happen when we \nwere working together.   \n\nAnother sense of good feeling, and this is not a partisan statement.  But, when, in my party, I see the big tent with \nso many different people and we're all together.  Tragically, another feeling of  unity and being an American is in \ntragedy.  I'll take the Mother Manuel(SP) killing and it was in a huge stadium.  The funeral of one of the person's, \nbut everybody from the community came.  There was not a respective color or creed.  And we were together \nembracing each other.  I think you understand what I'm saying.  There's actually physical feeling of goodness, that \nwe're connected, that we're one and the same.   \n\nSo, let me just ask this question to Mr. Picciolini.  In 2017, reports said that Americans who identify as white and \nChristian has dropped below 50 percent.  In 2018, it was reported that there were fewer births among whites than \ndeaths.  The report stated that deaths now outnumbered births among white people in more than half of the states \nin the country.  Are these demographic changes being used by white nationalists, number one?  And are there are \nfinding success in recruiting based on these demographic changes?  Mr. Picciolini? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Yes.  They're using exactly what you mentioned as fear mongering.  But what I would even caution is \n20 years down the road, that as our climate crisis ramps up, that we're going to see a refugee crisis like we've never \n\n\n\nseen before.  And at that point, we will see this rhetoric ramp up, and I think that is something we must get ahead of \nnow. \n\nJACKSON-LEE: Secondarily, you use the word education, I ask all three of you this question.  For a period of time, \nthe history of African Americans, people of color, were literally removed from the elementary and middle school \neducational curriculum.  What does that do when we saw that video that went viral, I cried, little two-year olds \nrunning towards each other--if you haven't seen it pull it up and feel good.  But the point is that we don't bring our \nchildren up to appreciate--understand--let me do this quickly since I see my time.  The other is, I ask the FBI this \nmorning, we were in a FISA hearing, which has to do various documents submitted to FISA Accord in the \ninternational terrorism utilized after 9/11.  But what I tried to glean from this individual was what tools do we need to \ngive them for domestic terrorism.   \n\nAnd so in the answer tell me, wouldn't it be important for the FBI to have tools that refer directly to domestic \nterrorism as we have had foreign operatives?  We can't use those, those are foreign operatives, we can't spy on our \ncitizen in the same way.  But I believe there should be a domestic terrorism with civil liberties and civil rights \ninvolved, the structure, but the in the DOJ. So, if you three could answer the education and the enforcement part of \nit. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: On the second question, yes, I believe that we need to understand homegrown violent extremists \nas operating across the spectrum, domestic and international, in ways that our current definitions allow for.  And \nthat hampers our ability to enhance our national security.   \n\nOn the education question, I would go on far too long, I just want to say I absolutely agree.  I think this starts very \nearly and we're talking about preventative work--cross cultural understanding, empathy, openness to difference.  \nAnd a wide variety of other outcomes that we're failing at right now. \n\nJACKSON-LEE: Mr. Picciolini? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Yes, I would just say that our resources right now are focused in a different direction. There have been \ngroups disbanded, even as far back as 2006, that called out this problem, that were disbanded and defunded.  An \norganization that I co-founded was also rescinded funding for an online intervention program.  So, there needs to be \na focus on this.   \n\nAs far as education, yes, absolutely.  Pre radicalization starts then.  And it could be an extremist behavior like \ncrime, drugs, prostitution, something like that.  Those are all extremist manifestations.  Or it could be flying to Syria \nor flying to the Ukraine to join a Neo Nazi group. \n\nJACKSON-LEE: Thank you.  Ms. Nazarian? \n\nNAZARIAN: I can tell you that the ADL is the largest trainer of law enforcement in America of any non-government \norganization.  So, we are training law enforcement representatives day in and day out, exactly on these issues \nabout what white supremacists look like, what is their symbology, what is the ideology behind them.  And we also \nhappen to be one of the largest purveyors of anti-bias education in public schools in America.  Over a million and a \nhalf students are educated by ADL on a day in and day out basis.  So, absolutely, in both those issues, we feel \nthey're very important and we have to expand them, we have to inoculate our communities, we have to inoculate \nour children.  We also have to give the tools and knowledge to law enforcement to be able to understand, recognize \nwhat's going on in communities, and to help prevent them.  So, absolutely. \n\nJACKSON-LEE: Chairman, thank you.  And I just want to put on the record that I did not, is that HCHAN(SP), and I \ndidn't have time to ask that question.  But, within the construct of civil liberties, first amendment, sites like that have \nto be addressed by the United States Congress.  And they were one of the motivators of some of the horrors of \nsome of the perpetrators of the most heinous mass shootings that we've had.   \n\nI thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back. \n\n\n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Ms. Jackson-Lee.  Mr. Green you're recognized for five minutes.   \n\nAL GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And I thank all the Chairpersons as well.   \n\nI would like to acknowledge the words of Emily Dickinson.  She reminds us that a word is dead when it is said, \nsome say, I'd say it just begins to live that day.  And I call these words to our attention because it's my belief that \nthe tone and tenor is usually set at the top, the captain of the football team, the CEO of the corporation, the head of \nthe nation.  And I am concerned when I read in the intelligence that's been accorded to us, that soon after the \nMarch 2019 attack at Christ Church New Zealand, President Trump expressed doubt that white nationalism was a \nrising threat around the world.  That caused me a good deal of consternation.   \n\nQuickly respond, if you would, to the words of the person who sets the tone and tenor. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I believe that is essential for us to have bipartisan support across the board to see white \nnationalist terrorism, white supremacist extremism as a critical threat to the nation.  So, yes, from the top down, but \nin every local community as well from leaders and across the board. \n\nPICCIOLINI: This is neither a Democratic nor a Republican problem.  This is a problem of American national \nsecurity.  And I would say that, just back to what I said earlier, there were words that I wrote 25 years ago that \nmanifested in death with somebody like Dylann Roof.  And we must be responsible for the words that we say, \nbecause while most people may not act on those words, there are--we know that there are some people who will.  \nWe've seen the effects of that.  So, I think certainly we must all measure our words when it comes to something so \nsensitive. \n\nNAZARIAN: We feel the bully pulpit is tremendously important.  And all our leaders, political and otherwise, need to \nbe held accountable and responsible for the words that they share.  And also, for standing up and calling things out \nexactly as they see it.  So, words matter, and I think all our leaders should be unequivocal about what is going on in \nour country today. \n\nAL GREEN: Were there any nice people among the folk who were screaming blood and soil, Jews will not replace \nus--Charlottesville?  Any nice people among them? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Sir, in my job, I have to believe that there were nice people there, because it is my job to try and pull \nthem out.  However, I think the statement of very fine people there was a very dangerous one, because it did \nequivocate two things that were not equal.   \n\nAL GREEN: Finally, there some--I've lived a long time.  Sometimes I think I've lived too long, to be quite honest.  I \nhave seen what racism can do to people.  And I marvel now at how I've lived long enough to see the Klan come out \nof the robe, take the hoods off, march the streets openly and notoriously.  I quite frankly, 20 years ago, would not \nhave prognosticated that such would be the case.  Something has happened to give them reason to believe that \nthey can show their faces.   \n\nPlease, I have one-minute left.  What happened? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: A lot of things have happened that have brought--I would say the underlying racist--you know, \nthings that people used to hide.  So, it's not the fringes coming, its that the racism has moved more into the \nmainstream.  And I think we're seeing that the way that social media operates, the kind of rhetoric that we hear \npolitical leaders and, in the media, has legitimized and reinforced those words.  And I think the kind of manifestos \nand those global circulation of videos seems to empower these people as well. \n\nAL GREEN: I know that you all have saline answer, but I have to ask this question quickly.  Do you believe that \nthose who tolerate bigotry and hate, perpetuate it?  Toleration, perpetuation, acceptance, perpetuation, please \nrespond. \n\n\n\nPICCIOLINI: From my--there are two things that extremists love and that's silence and violence.  When we ignore \nthem, they grow.  When we are violent against them they use that as victim narrative.  And we are quiet about what \nis happening in the world today, if we are not speaking truth to it, it will grow, it will fester like it has for 400 years.  \nAnd we have an opportunity, I think, right now as a learning moment to really fix--acknowledge the problems, the \nfailures that we've made, and work towards a solution that works for everybody. \n\nAL GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You've been more than kind. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Mr. Green.  I appreciate the questions I neglected to ask consent that you and Ms. Clark be \nable to ask questions as members of the full committee without objection.  Ms. Clark you're recognized for five \nminutes. \n\nCLARK: I thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thank both Chairman and the Ranking Member for holding this very important \nhearing.  \n\nAnd I just want to get some feedback on a number of the questions that were provided to us, you given a lot of \nreally important testimony.  Mr. Picciolini, I'm really interested in the deradicalization process.  Were there certain \nmessages or approaches that were most effective in your deradicalization process?  And in your opinion, which \naspects of current deradicalization efforts work and which do not?  And I heard you mention about, sort of the early \nchild education piece, but you recorded a later stage in life, so that would be very informative.   \n\nPICCIOLINI: You know, I do a lot of listening rather than debating or arguing.  And what I learned from listening is \nwhat I call potholes.  And those are the things that people run into in their life's journey, it could be trauma, it can be \npoverty, it could be joblessness, even privilege can keep us in a very isolated bubble.  And what I do is fill those \npotholes in, I work with social services, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals, job trainers, to really \nbuild resilience in people, without addressing the ideology.  The way I address the ideology is through introducing \nthem and immersing them with people that they think that they hate.   \n\nNow, that's a process that happened to me.  I received compassion from the people I least deserved from, at a time \nthat I least deserved it.  And for me, that was the most powerful transformative thing, because I had never in my life \nhad a meaningful interaction with the people, I thought I hated.  I had been brought in at 14.  Certainly not the \nresponsibility of people of color, or potential victims, to do that, which I think means just need to be nice to \neverybody all the time, because we never know who we're dealing with. But, the most powerful thing for me is \nactually going through that process of human resilience building rather than debate. \n\nCLARK: How do we engage and educate influencers within the communities that white nationalist terrorist groups \ntarget, to help counter message extremist propaganda? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Is that for me? \n\nCLARK: Yes. \n\nPICCIOLINI: Well, I think we just need to acknowledge that we have a problem first.  I think we're still debating \nabout if this is a problem.  Once we acknowledge that it's a problem, I also think we need institutional and systemic \nchanges.  Because the way its happening right now, what I do as far as deradicalization work, it's a band aid.  You \nknow, we have to treat it like polio.  I treat the sick, but also have to inoculate the population from getting sick.  And \nthat is through systemic and institutional change.  Otherwise, we just have a factory where we're churning out \nracists all the time. \n\nCLARK: Very well.   \n\nAnd then I wanted to ask about women.  We oftentimes hear about white males in this dynamic.  But in some of the \nsort of visuals that I've seen, I've seen women in photos that espouse similar ideologies.  Is there a place for \nwomen in the contemporary white nationalist moment?  And if so, what does that look like?  And that's for the entire \npanel. \n\n\n\nMILLER-IDRISS: We are seeing increasing participation of women in white supremacist groups, both in the US and \nin Europe, even in violent fringe groups, and even in terrorist violence.   They are still by far the minority compared \nto men in terms of violence, but they are engaging.  They're also engaging on channels like YouTube, setting up \nchannels that promote the ideology that draw people in and that kind of soften it a little bit, and are supporters in \nthat way, enablers I would say.  So, I think they play a very important role and have been overlooked.  And the \nother thing I will say is mothers play a very important role in some of the deradicalization work.  And we've seen \nwith that ISIS and foreign fighters, mother's groups and parenting groups, and I think we could similar kind of wave \nof parenting programs in the US around white supremacist extremism, as well. \n\nNAZARIAN: And I can just add, that internationally we're also seeing a rise in terms in the role of women.  Because \nthe issues, you know, inflames them, such as anti-immigrant sentiment.  It cuts across all gender lines.  So, it's not \nan issue its more male or female, that they're feeling their culture, their beliefs are being overrun by immigrants \nbeing different beliefs, different religions, others.  So, it definitely goes across line.  And you see women also being \nmuch more animated and much more angry about the fact that their white culture is being diluted, that they're being \nreplaced, internationally as well.  So, unfortunately that goes across all genders. \n\nPICCIOLINI: Just very briefly, women are being used as mouth pieces, as recruitment vessels.  They are often the \nones tasked with doing the podcast, making the videos.  Because women attract more men to the organization.  \nAnd I'll just point out, there was a report yesterday of a young woman who was arrested with an AR-15 in her trunk, \nwho had made threats against shooting 500 people, and had drawn swastikas on her stuff.  So this is something \nthat we will start to see mimic ISIS in the way that happens, as well. \n\nCLARK: (INAUDIBLE) your indulgence.  I yield back. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Ms. Clark.  And Ms. Omar, who is a member of the full committee, also has to ask questions.  \nAnd without objection, you're recognized for five minutes. \n\nOMAR: (INAUDIBLE) wonderful to the co-chairs of this committee.  I really do appreciate the opportunity to be \nallowed to join you all.  And to the testifiers, thank you so much for taking the time to have a really critical \nconversation on the ideology known as white nationalism. \n\nThe goal of these terrorists in this particular ideology is articulated after each attack.  And its one that is consistent, \nas it is unhinged, to create a white ethnos state that excludes religion, ethnic, and racial minorities.  Far right \nterrorists---far right terrorists were linked to every single extremist related murder in 2018.  The most in any year \nsince 1995, according to the Anti-Defamation League.  The Southern Poverty Law Center reports 50 percent \nincrease in white nationalist groups from 2017 to 2018.  I will not speculate why that has happened.  According to \nSPLC, 81 people were killed by those influenced by the Alt-Right since 2014. \n\nSo, I will repeat something I've said before, it is a statement of fact, white  men driven by hateful ideology of white \nnationalism are committing the overwhelming majority of extremist attacks in this country.  And we are not doing \nenough to confront it.  This is not an indictment of all white men.  Just like the despicable acts of few Al-Qaeda \nterrorists is not an indictment of all Muslims.  It is rather a call for action.  If we're going to take it serious, the threat \nof terrorism, we must truly do everything we can to minimize that threat.   \n\nSo, I apologize if I missay your name, Mr. Picciolini?   \n\nPICCIOLINI: Very good. \n\nOMAR: Ok.  I wanted to ask you something that was written in your testimony.   You said, adequate terrorism laws \nalready exist to thwart and prosecute terrorists, as  we do, plenty of capable and talented people who are ready to \ndefend us from that threat of harm.   The counter terrorism mandate doesn't provide for proper focus, resources, \nand funding.  Or in some cases, the correct holistic approach to effectively counter terrorism.   \n\n\n\nI worry about that, too, a lot.  Of course, I agree, that white nationalism should be considered terrorism.  But I'm \nconcerned about repeating some of the policy mistakes we've made in the so-called Global War on Terror since \n9/11.  I've been working to get more transparency on the terrorist screening database.  For example, I don't see a \nsolution to white nationalism that simply to just add more people onto that list.  We've gone down the wrong road.  \nAnd if we start talking about taking Klansmen to Guantanamo, what are we really saying?   \n\nI believe in restorative justice.  Some have faulted me for, you know, talking about ways that we should figure out \nhow to rehabilitate people.  And how that is actually one of the strongest counter terrorism acts that we could \ndeploy.  So, I'm--I believe it's a moral thing.  But I also feel like, again, it is one of the best ways to fight terrorism \nand extremism.  And so, I would love for you to sort of walk us through what are some of the holistic approaches we \nshould take, and could that be something that could be deployed even abroad as we fight counter terrorism as well? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Thank you.  That's an important question.  And I would say as far as the holistic approach is more \ntowards prevention.  So, you know, making sure that young people feel like they have agency, like they are \namplified through their passions, so they're alienated in youth.  Because what I've found is that, people, you know, \npeople aren't born Nazis or racists, they learn it.  And they can also unlearn it as well, but it takes repairing the \nfoundation underneath them and building human resilience to do that. \n\nBut in terms of the more holistic approach, it really is about prevention and inoculating the population.  We can't just \nfocus on the national security side if we're not ever going to turn the flow of the tab off to create more of these \nextremists.  So, I think that we have to have more inclusive programs in school.  We have to start teaching our \nhistory the right way.  You know, not only about 1619, but also that we're teaching the Civil War different in different \nparts of the country.  Where in some places its about northern aggression and in some places its about slavery.  \nWe don't even that sort of consistency.   \n\nSo, in terms of a holistic approach it really is about looking at our policies and our institutional, in many cases \nracism, to try and make sure that we are creating an equitable foundation for young people moving forward.  But, as \nfar as holistic as well national security, it would be providing solutions for people who want to disengage, to \ndisengage and to be able to do that.  But certainly, you know, there is a national security threat that should be dealt \nwith policy. \n\nOMAR: I appreciate that.  With that, I yield back my time. \n\nDEUTCH: Thank you, Ms. Omar.  Ms. Jackson-Lee had asked unanimous consent to enter three articles into the \nrecord.  PBS article, White Christians are now a minority of the US population.  New York Times article, Fewer \nbirths than deaths among whites in majority of US states.  And an ABC News article, Experts dissect reasons while \nmass shooters target houses of worship.  Without objection, they'll be entered into the record. \n\nFinally, I will acknowledge myself. \n\nI am--I'm really grateful for your being here today.  I want to talk about two things.  Mr. Picciolini, when--when--\nyou've all talked about the--the responsibility the platforms have to do a better job.  We often, we have this sense \nthat there's a Facebook page, and people go to the Facebook page and they get radicalized.  And that's not how it \nworks.  They're drawn in, Mr. Picciolini, right?  And it's through the social media that we access.  And then they are \ngiven the link to get to the dark web, the HCHAN, or get to the other site where they can watch--its' not a clean up \nversion, where they can watch people out screaming horrible things on video, shooting off their AR-15's, talking \nabout what they want to do to blacks and Jews and Muslims.  Is that right? \n\nPICCIOLINI: That's correct.  They have what they call gatekeepers, who are very kind of benign, not very outwardly \nwhite supremacist. And then they kind of send of them into a stepped process purity spiral, where they eventually \nget into the Holocaust denial videos and things like that. \n\n\n\nDEUTCH: Right.  And so, what should we be--I think we need to stop tip toeing around this issue.  We do this \nnicely, but the fact is, there is a way in.  And if there's a way in, there's a way to block the way in, isn't there?  So, \nwhat more, specifically, should we be doing?  And I'll ask all of our witnesses.  Dr. Miller-Idriss? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Well, I think there are a few things.  One, I think we need to have many more of these kinds of \nconversations both on the record, off the record.  Also, with experts on online radicalization and experts who have \nbeen, you know, recently deradicalized from having been online radicalization.   \n\nDEUTCH: Right. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: I think we need to figure out ways to change the recommendation systems, those recommender \nsystems.  But I also think we need to figure ways to fund more proactive approaches to--to--you know you can \ngame the algorithms to change--by funding people who are putting positive content on there so that you get more \npositive content showing up in the feeds, right? \n\nDEUTCH: Right. \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Because we can't always-- \n\nDEUTCH: --if someone's searching, if I may?  If someone's searching for hate filled videos and there is research \nthat shows, and Mr. Picciolini's own experience that shows, where that can lead, then maybe the right--the \nalgorithm, the right algorithm isn't the one that takes them to even more violent, hate filled videos.  But, maybe it's \nthe opposite direction.  Is that right, Mr. Picciolini? \n\nPICCIOLINI: That's right.  And there's so much content being uploaded that its really relied on AI to make those \ndecisions right now. \n\nDEUTCH: Right. \n\nPICCIOLINI: But I would also caution, too, that so much of this propaganda is coming from outside of the US.  And \nbeing bolstered--these messages here domestically being bolstered by places in Eastern Europe and in Russia, in \ntroll farms.  So, it's going to be difficult, because they are just marketing methods.  And they've also created their \nown platforms.  So, we can we deplatform(SP) all we want, but they have now created their social networks, and \nencrypted platforms. \n\nDEUTCH: And we have--you talked about VCON(SP) tactics, so--right there, what's happening abroad on the social \nmedia and the 1,000's of people going to Ukraine.  Dr. Nazarian, can you just touch on that for a second?  And how \nsocial media and actual on the ground violence come together? \n\nNAZARIAN: Well, we do so, actually the terminology involved in sharing with one another.  So, we are seeing the \nuse and cross polarization.  And I talked about the use of terminology from Ukraine penetrating to America and vice \nversa.  What I did want to say that, look, the terms of service of the platforms have to be more clearly adhered to.  \nThey're responsible, the platforms themselves, to make sure that the rules they have are enforced.  And they're not \ndoing a good enough job and do it at scale.  So, there is room for improvement there.   \n\nAnd we would also, at the ADL, really like to see better governance.  We want to see them scheduling external \nindependent audits of the work.  They're not really telling us how much information is coming in terms of data that's \nbeing flagged.  We don't really know how much reporting is done.  All they're telling us things they're moving on, \nthat's actionable.   \n\nSo, better transparency in terms of how much reporting of hate language is coming in.  We don't really have that, as \nwell.  And that's a problem. \n\nDEUTCH: We should have better transparency.  And then one another, online, you mentioned online gaming.   \n\n\n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes. \n\nDEUTCH: There is a tendency to some to blame video games for violence.  That's not what I want to talk about.  I \nwant to talk about the actual conversations that are taking place that presumably those online companies have \nsome access to.  How does that work, Mr. Picciolini?  \n\nPICCIOLINI: So, yeah, what's happening is when young people or anybody really is playing a multi-player online \ngame, they're wearing headsets.  And they're usually playing with multiple people.  And what happens, and I've \nwitnessed it is, a recruiter will say something like the N word or make a joke, engage who laughs, who pushes up \nagainst it, and who doesn't say anything.  Well, they know can go after the people who laughed, even it was a \nnervous laugh, from a 10-year-old, they know that they have an in there, and they send them down that spiral.  But \nit's also happening in places like depression forums and autism forums online, where they are going, they're \nlooking-- \n\nDEUTCH: --are those monitored?  Is there a way to address that? \n\nPICCIOLINI: Well, you know, I think that are probably moderators for all those rooms.  But I don't think that they \nwould be skilled in identifying-- \n\nDEUTCH: --is there a way that AI can be employed to identify those sorts of conversations? \n\nNAZARIAN: Well, we do know that they're unregulated completely.  So, the fact that we as legislators, as people, \nhave to look at these sectors, that they need to be better regulated.  And we know for a fact, right now they're not \nregulated. \n\nDEUTCH: And finally, I just want to end with this.  There's been conversation about the mainstreaming of ideology.  \nAnd I started--we started by talking about the importance of identifying white nationalist terrorism, white supremacist \nideology, a discussion of language.  But, its not the mainstreaming of ideology, is it?  It's the mainstreaming of what \nis that ideology.  It's the mainstreaming of racism, and the mainstreaming of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, and \nxenophobia.   \n\nAnd when you talk about David Duke taking off his hood and entering politics, it's not that we should--we should \nthen identifying white--the white--the language that identifies as a white supremacist, its anytime anyone of us ever \nuses the language of racism and anti-Semitism, and other forms of hatred, isn't it?  And don't we have an obligation, \nis it too much to ask that language just never be accepted? \n\nMILLER-IDRISS: Yes. \n\nPICCIOLINI: You're absolutely correct. \n\nNAZARIAN: Absolutely. \n\nDEUTCH: I'm really grateful for the three of you coming and for this hearing, and the thoughtful exchanges that you \nhad with my colleagues.  I thank the members of both subcommittees for being here today. \n\nMembers may have some additional questions for you, and we ask our witnesses to please respond to those \nquestions in writing.  And I'd ask my colleagues and any witness questions for the hearing be submitted to the \nsubcommittee clerks within five business days.  And with that, without objection, the hearing is adjourned. \n"}
