{"title": "IMMIGRANT IS PENALIZED $110 FOR INS MISTAKE", "body": "\nMistakes are one thing. Paying for one someone else made to the tune of $ 110 is another.\n\nBut Simon Perkins said that's what happened during a recent visit to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \nManhattan.\n\nPerkins, 29, is a legal immigrant from England. \"I have been married to an American for four years, and I am proud \nof my new country and the opportunity it has given me,\" he said.\n\nPerkins successfully received green card status. But the card never came in the mail. When he went to Federal \nPlaza to find out what was wrong, he discovered the card had been sent to the wrong address.\n\nSomeone mailed it to W. 187th St. rather than West 87th St., even though the original application shows the correct \naddress.\n\nPerkins didn't think there'd be a problem getting a replacement card. He was wrong. \"After waiting from 7 a.m. to \n1:30 p.m., the representative informed me I would have to pay $ 110 for it,\" he explained.\n\nPerkins said he can live with \"the rudeness of the immigration officials, the regular costs of the applications and \nday-long marathons\" at the INS for the last five years.\n\nBut he objects to having to pay for a mistake he didn't make.\n\n\"It's not a huge sum of money,\" he writes. \"But no one in the INS will take responsibility for this.\"\n\nSomeone did. INS spokesman Mark Thorne had the case reviewed.\n\nOfficials found someone had made not one, but two mistakes: first by entering the wrong address, then by \npenalizing Perkins for the error. They sent Perkins a refund and an apology.\n\nNow that's the American way.\n\nAsa Aarons is a consumer reporter who appears on WNBC-TV, Channel 4 News.
