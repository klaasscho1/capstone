{"title": "Mexico Asylum Cases Must Be Reduced", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nAlthough there has been an increase in Mexican nationals granted asylum in the United States this year, after \nyears in which such applications were routinely denied, the number is still small -- 55 -- and represents one-half of 1 \npercent of all asylum applicants from Mexico.\n\nOf greater concern is that more than 9,500 Mexican nationals have filed applications for asylum in a single year.\n\nBased on the rate of approvals, we can assume that the majority of these applications are frivolous and have been \nfiled by illegal aliens solely to delay their departure from the United States.\n\nHouse Resolution 2202, the immigration bill of which I am the principal sponsor, includes provisions to reduce the \nfiling of frivolous asylum claims. These include requirements that arriving aliens who have no valid entry \ndocuments establish a credible fear of persecution before they are permitted to enter the United States and pursue \nan asylum application.\n\nThe legislation also streamlines procedures for adjudicating asylum claims and for removing illegal aliens from the \nUnited States.\n\nOur asylum system should protect legitimate refugees, whatever their country of origin. But abuse of the asylum \nsystem, as shown by the number of Mexican applicants, must end.\n\n \n\n(Rep.) LAMAR SMITH\n\nChairman, Subcommittee on\n\nImmigration and Claims\n\nWashington, Dec. 11, 1995\n"}
