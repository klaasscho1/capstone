{"title": "69% SAY GUEST WORKER PLAN OK", "body": "\nMOST AMERICANS believe illegal immigrants should be allowed to become guest workers under a process that \nwould eventually lead to citizenship.\n\nAt the same time, they want Congress to do more to close the border to stop illegals from entering the country.\n\nIn a nationwide poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, 69% of American voters said illegal immigrants should be \nallowed into a guest worker program and be able to work toward citizenship over a period of several years. \nTwenty-seven percent opposed that view.\n\n\"Two-thirds of Americans favor a guest worker program with a path to citizenship,\" according to Maurice Carroll, \ndirector of Quinnipiac's Polling Institute. \"Maybe a lot of Americans think back to the stories of their own immigrant \nfamilies.\"\n\nPerhaps most surprising, the guest worker program had wide support among voters of all political stripes, Carroll \nsaid.\n\nThe poll also found \"big margins for a tougher border policy among all parties and among men and women,\" the \npollster noted.\n\nIn addition, 65% of American voters support - and 32% oppose - laws in their own communities to fine businesses \nthat hire illegal immigrants, according to poll results.\n\n\"Americans think more needs to be done to deal with illegal immigration, and they want it done in their own \nneighborhoods as well,\" Carroll added.\n\nThe poll was conducted one week after the election, from Nov. 13 to 19, among 1,623 registered voters and had a \nmargin of error of 2.4 percentage points.\n"}
