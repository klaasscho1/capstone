{"title": "N. Korea detains a second U.S. citizen", "body": "\nNorth Korea has notified the United States that it has another American in custody for allegedly entering the \ncountry illegally, the State Department announced Friday.\n\nDepartment spokesman P.J. Crowley said that the North Koreans, in a bare-bones message through their United \nNations representative, provided no identifying information   -- no name or gender and no details of the alleged \noffense.\n\nThis is the second case of a detained American in North Korea to surface in the past month, further complicating \na relationship that has been strained for years over North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and periodic test-\nfiring of missiles in defiance of U.N. Security Council warnings.\n\nIn late December, North Korea said it was holding a U.S. citizen for illegally entering through the North Korea-\nChina border. It did not identify the man, but the State Department has said he is Robert Park, an American \nmissionary.\n\n -- Associated Press \n"}
