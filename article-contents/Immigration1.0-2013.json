{"title": "EXPOSING 'WRONGS' DONE TO CHINESE IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nEXPOSING HUMAN rights abuses continues to be the mission of public television's \"Rights & Wrongs,\" which \nlaunches its fourth season tonight at 10:30 on PBS (WNET/Ch. 13).\n\nTonight's premiere focuses on the abuse or mistreatment of Chinese immigrants by the governments of China \nand the U.S., as well as by freelance smugglers known as Snakeheads.\n\nIndependent producer Jon Alpert, working with ace Daily News reporter Ying Chan (currently on leave from the \npaper for a prestigious Nieman fellowship at Harvard), supplies the centerpiece of the half-hour broadcast: a report \ntaped on locations in China, in New York's Chinatown and in a jail in the California desert.\n\nAlpert begins his piece recalling the notorious Golden Venture, a smuggling ship bearing hundreds of illegal \nChinese immigrants that ran aground just outside New York Harbor in 1993.\n\nAlpert, Chan and producer Peter Kwang track some the survivors of that wreck to the Kern Co. jail outside \nBakersfield, Calif., where they have been confined for years, and to basements in Chinatown, where scores of \nimmigrants live in squalor as they desperately work to pay off debts to the brutal Snakeheads.\n\nFinally, the team travels to China and has no trouble finding Snakeheads cutting deals for boatloads of human \ncargo. They even discover a Chinese government agency that appears to be running its own immigrant-smuggling \noperation, in competition with the Snakeheads.\n\nCharlayne Hunter-Gault of PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" returns as the host/anchor of \"Rights & Wrongs.\"As \nusual, she adds a little polish to the proceedings but not much else.\n\nA discussion segment that follows the Alpert piece is dry, to put it charitably.\n\nBut the program ends with images of remarkable sculptures made in jail by survivors of the Golden Venture wreck \nthree-dimensional houses, birds and even ships, created with astounding ingenuity from little more than magazines \nand glue.\n\nIt should be noted that, because of Alpert's long-running relationship with NBC News, some footage shot in China \nappeared last spring on an installment of \"Dateline.\"\n"}
