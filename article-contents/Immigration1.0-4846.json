{"title": "IMMIGRANTS' CHILDREN FARE WELL IN STUDY", "body": "\nThe children of immigrants have higher grades and sharply lower dropout rates than other American children, \naccording to a four-year study that claims to be the largest of its kind.\n\nThe study, reported yesterday in the New York Times, says the children also largely prefer English to their parents' \nnative languages.\n\nThe adolescents surveyed were predominantly Hispanic, Asian and black, and a majority said they had experienced \ndiscrimination. But an even larger majority said they believed the United States was the best country to live in.\n\nThe study's lead researchers said the findings indicated that the children of immigrants were unlikely to develop \ninto an underclass, as some experts fear, cut off from the mainstream by academic failure and an inability to speak \nEnglish.\n\nBut the researchers also said it was still uncertain how well the children of immigrants - who make up 20 percent \nof all children in the United States - would do in college and the job market.\n\nThe research team - led by sociologists Ruben Rumbaut of Michigan State University and Alejandro Portes of \nPrinceton University - first interviewed 5,200 eighth and ninth graders in San Diego and Miami in 1992. They found \n82 percent of them for a second interview in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe children of Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Korean parents got the best grades - an average of A's and B's. \nLatin American and Haitian children performed poorest, with close to C averages.\n\nThe number of children who are either immigrants or the American-born offspring of immigrants grew to 13.7 \nmillion last year, from 8 million in 1990. That makes them the fastest-growing segment of the population under the \nage of 18.\n"}
