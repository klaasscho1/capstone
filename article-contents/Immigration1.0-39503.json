{"title": "Curb immigration flood", "body": "\nImmigration has suddenly jumped off the back burner and has emerged as one of the most important issues \nconfronting the USA. For years, public opinion polls have been telling us that the American people believe legal \nimmigration levels are too high and that illegal immigration is out of control.\n\nThe sudden attention that immigration has been receiving is due to many factors. The most important is the \nunprecedented number of immigrants, legal and illegal, who are settling in the USA each year. Depending on \nestimates of illegal immigration, between 1.2 million and 1.5 million newcomers settle here annually. This influx is \noccurring irrespective of the ability of communities to absorb the new settlers, the costs associated with \nimmigration (and they are enormous), the strain on schools, public health facilities, housing or labor markets, or \nthe environment.\n\nProponents of the status quo like to point to the USA's \"immigrant tradition\" to justify the current extreme levels of \nimmigration. However, we need to take a closer look at what the tradition really is. Between 1820 (when records \nbegan to be kept) and 1965, average annual immigration was 297,000. Contrast that with current levels, and you \nrealize there is nothing traditional about trying to absorb the equivalent of a major metropolitan area each year.\n\nTo their credit, the American people have directed their unhappiness at the policies and the people who make \nimmigration policies, not at immigrants themselves. Public disapproval of immigration policies is as legitimate as \ndisapproval of tax policies or the budget deficit. Immigration policy is, after all, a public policy and is supposed to \nserve the interests of the USA.\n\nClearly, the American people do not feel it does.\n\nNotes\n\nTHE EDITORIAL PAGE; Today's debate is on IMMIGRATION and what direction our national policy should take; \nOPPOSING VIEW; The USA can't absorb the volume of newcomers pouring into the country; Dan Stein is \nexecutive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n"}
