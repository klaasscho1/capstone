{"title": "Political Conditions Russia", "body": "\nIntroduction\n\nIslamic insurgency and a decade of transitional economic orchestrations have politically bedeviled the Russian \nFederation. Today, still amid those concerns, it continues its evolution from the Boris Yeltsin administration to a new \ncadre of leaders.\n\nFirst came the August 1999 firing of Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who had been prime minister since May \n1999. In Stepashin's place, President Yeltsin nominated Vladimir Putin, the former head of the Federal Security \nService (previously known as the KGB). Putin won Duma approval on Aug. 16, 1999, on a program of restoring law \nand order, continuing the fight against Islamic separatists, and pursuing the economic policies of Stepashin. The \ncontinuation of Stepashin's policies was also evident in the reappointment of most of the previous government's \nministers.\n\nSeven months following his appointment, Putin was elected president by 53 percent of the vote in March 2000. \nFollowing his victory, Putin nominated an ally, Mikhail Kasyanov, as his choice for prime minister.\n\nThe State Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliamentary system, approved Kasyanov as the country's new \nprime minister on May 17, 2000. As a former finance minister it was expected the pro-Putin Kasyanov would \nearmark economic recovery as his chief responsibility. Kasyanov made a name for himself earlier in 2000 by \nnegotiating and winning a large reduction in the portion of debt owed to creditors, The London Club. He was also \ncredited with increasing the salaries of state employees and for maintaining the federation's schedule of payments \nto foreign creditors.\n\nMuch of his acumen for fiscal reform was expected to continue. \"Reforms must be energetic, consistent and \nbalanced,\" the newly installed prime minister said in his acceptance speech on May 17, 2000. He added there were \nsome tough political decisions ahead to be forged and that the will, support and consensus of the Russian people \nwould be required. \"Even the strongest government of professionals can't resolve national problems without the \nsupport of the whole of society,\" Kasyanov said.\n\nFortunately for the Putin administration, its political voyage began on a high note. Russian oil prices had been \nincreasing, leading to a replenished treasury. However, what is past is prologue: the breakaway republic of \nChechnya (discussed in the Appendix of this review) and the transition from a closed-system economy to a more \nopen one paved the road ahead.\n\n\nTo appreciate what Putin, Kasyanov and federation ministers faced, what follows is an exploration of the political \nconditions, which has set the stage for today's reform in Russia. This exploration begins with the elections in the \nperiod of 1999 and 2000 and moves toward the post-Putin era at the end of the decade, followed by the return of \nPutin to the forefront of the Russian political scene from 2012 and beyond. Other domestic, regional and \ninternational issues are also considered in the discussion following.\n\nDuma and Presidential Election Atmosphere (1999-2000)\n\nAlthough Russia faced numerous political and economic challenges, such as combating organized crime and \nstrengthening tax collection efforts, the Chechen war dominated as the major issue of the December State Duma \nelection campaign. The approval of the initial Russian attacks in Chechnya resulted in most candidates expounding \nsupport of the war effort. There was, however, some opposition to the ongoing attack; many candidates publicly \nopposed a ground war. In the early days of the conflict, Putin, too, had stated his intention to avoid a long ground \nwar. Other political leaders who supported military action short of a ground war included Grigory Yavlinsky of the \nliberal \"Yabloko\" party, former Prime Minister Primakov, and the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov.\n\nMany analysts viewed the Duma elections as a foretaste of the presidential election scheduled for June 2000. \nUndeclared presidential candidates used the Duma election campaigns of their various parties or factions as a \nmeans of testing the public's appetite for their own candidacies. Although Prime Minister Putin was not a leader of \nany political party, a new pro-Kremlin party, \"Unity,\" or MEDVED, was formed under the leadership of the \nEmergencies Minister, Sergey Shoygu (or Shoigu). Other major contenders in the Duma elections included: the \nCommunist Party of the Russian Federation, or KPRF, under Zyuganov; Fatherland-All Russia, or OVR, led by the \nmayor of Moscow, Luzhkov, and former prime minister, Primakov; the liberal \"Yabloko\" party, led by Grigory \nYavlinsky; and the pro-Kremlin, Union of Right Forces, or SPS, under the leadership of former prime minister \nKiriyenko and other reformers. The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, or LDPR, which espouses strongly \nnationalistic and xenophobic policies, was barred from registering the party's list of candidates by the Central \nElection Commission because several of the LDPR candidates were undergoing criminal prosecution. The leader of \nt he LDPR, Zhirinovsky, formed a new association, \"Zhirinovsky's Bloc,\" or BZ, to replace the banned LDPR and \nremoved the offending candidates from the party list.\n\nThe media played a very central role in the campaigning, with various candidates closely allied with various media \ncompanies. The centrist party of Fatherland-All Russia viewed as being attacked by Kremlin-controlled state media, \nbut Fatherland-All Russia responded to the attacks with media in Moscow influenced by Luzhkov. The campaigns \nwere also characterized by the candidacy of a number of the oligarchs and criminal figures that allegedly ran for \nseats in the Duma to win immunity from prosecution. Media mogul Boris Berezovsk, who had been seen as a \npivotal political actor behind Yeltsin's administration while also routinely facing  investigationd, ran for and won a \nseat in the Duma.\n\nEleven parties or party alliances, plus a large group of non-partisans, won seats in the Dec. 19, 1999, Duma \nelections. The \"Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Rossiiyskoyi Federatsiyi\" (Communist Party of the Russian Federation \nor KPRF) won the highest percentage of popular votes with 24.3 percent and won the greatest number of seats at \n113. The pro-Kremlin \"Mezhregional'noye Dvizhenie Yedinstvo\" party (Inter-Regional Movement Unity, \"Unity\" or \nMEDVED) came in second with 23.3 percent of the votes, winning 72 out of the 450 Duma seats. The centrist \n\"Otechestvo Vsya Rossiya\" (Fatherland-All Russia or OVR) won 13.3 percent of the votes and 66 seats. The other \nmajor parties to pass the five-percent threshold included: \"Soyuz Pravykh Sil\" (Union of Right Forces or SPS) \nwinning 8.5 percent and 29 seats; the former Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, now \"Blok Zhirinovskogo\" \n(Zhirinovsky's Bloc or BZ), winning six percent and 17 seats; and \"Yabloko\" winning 5.9 percent and 21 seats.\n\nOther parties which failed to pass the five percent threshold but still won seats in the single -seat constituencies \ninclude: \"Nash dom Rossiya\" (Our Home is Russia or NDR) with seven seats; \"Obsherossiyskoye Politcheskoye \nDvizhenie v Podderzhku Armiyi\" (All-Russian Political Movement in Support of the Army or DPA) with two seats; \n\"Partiya Pensionerov\" (Pensioners' Party or PP) with one seat; the \"Kongress Russkikh Obshchin i Dvizhenie Y. \n\n\n\nBoldyreva\" (Congress of Russian Communities and Yuri Boldyrev's Movement or KRO-DYB) with one seat; and \n\"Russkaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya\" (Russian Socialist Party or RSP) with one seat. Additionally, non-partisans \nwon 106 seats. In another important election at the time, Yuri Luzhkov won reelection as Moscow's mayor by a \nlarge percentage.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly announced his resignation as president of Russia and named the prime \nminister, Vladimir Putin, acting president. While apologizing for many of his failed policies, Yeltsin also endorsed \nPutin as his successor. Abiding by the constitutional requirement that presidential elections be held within three \nmonths of a president's resignation, Yeltsin also announced that the presidential elections previously scheduled for \nJune would be held on March 26, 2000, a date later approved by the upper house of the parliament. In addition to \nproviding opponents less time to organize presidential campaigns, Yeltsin's resignation allowed Putin to take \nadvantage of incumbency and the popularity that resulted from the Chechen war.\n\nUpon taking over as president, Putin attempted to change some of the impressions of cronyism created by the \nYeltsin administration by dismissing Tatiana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter and key adviser. Putin also dismissed \nthe manager of Kremlin properties, Pavel Borodin. Issues concerning the Kremlin's vast holdings had given rise to \nmost of the impressions of corruption in the Yeltsin administration, and Borodin, as the person in charge, had been \nunder investigation for receiving bribes. However, Putin also granted immunity to Yeltsin against prosecution for \nalleged crimes that occurred during his years in power.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2000, the Duma re-elected a Communist deputy, Gennady Seleznyov, as speaker of the lower house. \nSeleznyov's re-election was made possible by cooperation between the Communists, the largest faction in the \nDuma, and the Unity party, the pro-Kremlin party formed in September prior to the Duma elections. More than 100 \ndeputies began boycotting Duma sessions in protest against the alliance made between the Communists and Unity. \nAmong those boycotting were the centrist Fatherland-All Russia, led by Primakov, who also ran for speaker of the \nDuma, the liberal Union of Right Forces, and the liberal \"Yabloko.\" In addition to Seleznyov's reelection, many \ndeputies were upset by Zhirinovsky's elevation to deputy speaker of the Duma. On Jan. 27, 2000, the deputies \nended their boycott. Nevertheless, an odd situation had arisen in which political parties whose political programs \ncomplement the goals of the Kremlin were compelled to enter into opposition to Putin and a government appointed \nby Putin.\n\nWhile the politics of the Duma elections, Yeltsin's surprise resignation, and its aftermath were being played out, the \nmilitary action in Chechnya had entered a new phase. Russian forces were no longer engaged in just bombardment \nof Chechen positions, but were also actively engaging Chechen separatists with ground troops in an attempt to \ncapture Chechen strongholds. While Russian forces were successful in capturing key towns in Chechnya as well as \nparts of the capital, Grozny, fighting in the capital continued.\n\nThe change in tactics from only artillery shelling and air attacks to bombardment in tandem with ground assaults \nincreased Russian casualty numbers. Although the exact numbers were under much dispute, it was evident that \nRussian forces were suffering substantial casualties as the intensity of the fighting increased.\n\nOn March 26, 2000, Russia held its second post-Soviet presidential elections; acting President Vladimir Putin won \nthe election with 52.6 percent of the votes. His opponents received the following: Gennady Andreyevich Zyuganov \n(KPRF) 29.3 percent, Grigoriy Alekseyevich Yavlinsky (Yabloko) 5.8 percent, Amman M. Tulane 3 percent, Vladimir \nVol'fovich Zhirinovsky (LDPR) 2.7 percent, Konstantin A. Titov 1.5 percent, Ella A. Pamfilova 1 percent, Stanislav S. \nGovorukin 0.5 percent, Yuri I. Skuratov 0.4 percent, Alexei I. Podberyozkin 0.1 percent and Umar A. Dzhabrailov \n0.1 percent. Although the election was supervised by a group of international mediators, which judged the election \nfair, it should be noted there was widespread speculation of the media's bias toward Putin.\n\nPresident Putin's determination to resolve the problem in Chechnya became the focal point of his presidential \ncampaign. Prior to the election, Russian forces captured two of the main Chechen guerrilla commanders Salman \n\n\n\nRaduyev and Salautdin Timirbulatove. In addition, Putin visited Russian troops stationed in Chechnya to boost \nmorale. Polls suggested that voters looked favorably on these actions.\n\nDomestic Political Landscape\n\nSince taking office, President Putin's government faced several pressing issues on the domestic landscape, \nincluding a weak economy, decentralized power and waning international recognition. In terms of the economy, one \nthird of the population lives in poverty while the country's wealth is concentrated in a small percentage. President \nPutin announced his intention to modernize the economy with the hope of rescuing Russia's economy from several \nyears of depression. President Putin suggested that his government would espouse market reform. According to \nPutin, state intervention would increase, inevitably forcing Russia's 89 regions to become less autonomous. Finally \nPutin announced plans to bolster Russia's military capacity with an emphasis on nuclear weapons. This decision to \nincrease Russia's nuclear arsenal could significantly hurt Russia's foreign relations with certain countries such as \nthe United States and Great Britain.\n\nRussia has suffered from very high criminal activity ranging from petty street crime to white collar and bureaucratic \ncorruption. Although early in his presidency, President Putin announced his intention to fight corruption at all levels, \nlittle improvement has been made. In mid-2001, Transparency International ranked Russia as a corrupt country \ngiving it a score of 2.3, with 10 being highly \"clean\" and one being highly corrupt. Organized crime has influenced \npolitics in Russia; often, political parties are funded with mafia money. Corruption and organized crime have also \naffected foreign investment in the country. In 2001, over 7,000 murderers escaped punishment and remain free; \nand 30,000 people have disappeared. In a February 2002 speech directed at law enforcement officials, Putin \nharshly criticized the current state of law enforcement and demanded that changes be made to ensure the safety of \nthe Russian citizens in business and daily life.\n\nCritics have suggested that Putin's ability to push through land reform has been a vital indicator of his ability to \nenact and secure economic reform and his commitment to attracting foreign and domestic investment. Although \nsince 1993 it has been legal for Russian citizens to own land, there had been no legal means for land to be bought \nor sold. In October 2001, the Russian Land Code, the legal framework for selling and buying urban land and land \nfor industrial use, was approved by President Putin and became law. This law is a milestone in Russian political and \neconomic life as it makes provisions for foreign ownership, taxation, the methods of placing value on land, the legal \nrights of landowners and enacts measures to protect the environment on industrialized lands.\n\nAlthough the framework for urban and industrialized land has been in place for several months now, agricultural \nland reform has been slower in developing, as it is considered a very controversial subject. Putin's biggest critics of \nthis reform have been the communists and agrarians who are firmly against the selling of farmlands to foreigners. \nOther worries that surround private ownership include the concern that agricultural lands will be used for \nspeculation and how much land can be sold to an individual. Putin is insisting that agricultural reform be pushed \nforward and that individual regions put forth their recommendations on the restrictions and procedures on private \nland acquisition. Legislation on a new agricultural land code was expected to be completed in the next few years.\n\nThe accidental sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in August 2000 and the death of more than 100 \ncrewmembers rattled the Putin administration. The families of the victims, who apparently suffocated in the \nsubmerged vessel, declared Putin and other Russian officials cold and unconcerned. Ultimately a military \ncommission determined the accidental cause of the disaster and the vessel was raised and returned to his home \nbase of Murmansk. The Kremlin demoted three top navy commanders and sacked another eight admirals on Dec. \n1, 2001, in a expulsion that some observers said was punishment for the Kursk nuclear submarine catastrophe in \nwhich 118 crew died a year and a half earlier. Senior military officials denied a direct link with the Kursk disaster, \nsaying the sanctions related to \"serious failures in the organization of the military training activities of the fleet.\" The \ndisaster, the worst in modern Russian naval history, saw Putin publicly berated for failing to end his holiday and \ntake personal charge of the crisis.\n\n\n\nRussia, a country of about 145 million people, had in December 2001 about 163,000 patients infected with \nHIV/AIDS, a fraction of the four million cases registered, for example, in South Africa, according to government \nhealth officials.\n\nHowever, experts say these statistics hide a catastrophic epidemic, with real figures up to five times those on \ngovernment files. A bigger problem is the number of young people affected by the disease. More than 80 percent of \nrecorded cases affect people under 30 years old. Initially, HIV spread heavily through Russia's gay community, \nthough drug addicts contracting the disease from infected needles soon came to represent the vast majority of \ncases. HIV/AIDS is now spreading rapidly among heterosexuals, doctors have noted. Many heterosexuals remain \noff the record books, their contamination with the virus registered only as \"reason unknown.\"\n\nThe issue of media freedom in Russia has also been a key concern for the country. The June 2003 closure of the \nlast of Russia's three independent television stations has resulted in charges of political influence. TVS, like TV6 \nand NTV before, had been critical of the Russian government and Russian leaders. Its sudden closure was \ndescribed as being reminiscent of \"Soviet-style\" machinations when critical and contestatory voices were silenced. \nOther news agencies across the expanse of Russian media expressed dismay at the closure of TVS. They warned \nagainst state monopolization of media channels. Some observed that Russia's national television had been reduced \nto state-run channels and entertainment channels. Certainly, in the case of TVS, the plan is to have it replaced with \na sports channel.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian press ministry explained that the closure of the station had been due to financial, personnel \nand management problems. Indeed, before being shut down completely, TVS had earlier been dropped from \nMoscow's main cable company's offering. Nevertheless, TVS insisted that aside from the obvious financial, \npersonnel and management problems, there was also a political element that led to the station's closure. \nRepresentatives from TVS charged that instead of allowing the operational challenges to bring an end to the \nstation, it had been pulled off the air instead. Questions about media freedom have thusly been a concern in recent \nyears.\n\nElections in 2003 and 2004\n\nIn December 2003, approximately 23 party lists participated in the fourth elections since the collapse of the former \nSoviet Union. Half of the 450 seats in the Duma were at play, while the other 225 seats were contested by \nindividual candidates. The results of the election determined the composition of the Duma for the next four years.\n\nEarly results showed that the United Russia Party, which has backed President Putin and the Kremlin, appeared \nheaded for victory with over 36 percent of the votes cast. The nationalist party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, ironically \nnamed the Liberal Democrats, appeared to have secured 12 percent of the votes -- just slightly less than the \nCommunists, who garnered 12.8 percent of the votes cast. Other sources, however, suggested that the \nCommunists may have acquired as much as 15 percent. The Homeland bloc obtained close to 9 percent. According \nto some sources, the two liberal, free market parties each carried less than the 5 percent required to control party \nlist seats in parliament. Other election sources, however, showed a range of results for the Union of Right Forces -- \nfrom 4 percent to 9 percent of votes, and Yabloko -- from 5 percent to 7 percent of votes.\n\nTurnout for the election was over 30 percent and therefore exceeded the 25 percent threshold required to validate \nthe election poll.\n\nThe overwhelming success of the United Russia Party resulted in criticism by observers and opposition. They \ncharged that the election campaign had been dominated by media bias in favor of the leading party.\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2004, Russian President Putin announced the dismissal of the government led by Prime Minister \nMikhail Kasayanov. Having sacked his entire cabinet, Russian President Putin named European Union envoy and \nformer tax police chief, Mikhail Fradkov, as his new prime minister. Reports suggested that Putin decided to remove \nKasyanov because of his close relationship with Russia's oligarchs and his ties to the administration of Boris \nYeltsin. The move came in anticipation of the March 14 elections, which Putin was expected to win by a landslide \nvictory.\n\n\n\nIn those presidential elections, President Vladimir Putin won more than 70 percent of the votes cast. Putin's closest \nopponent, Communist candidate Nikolai Kharitonov, achieved a distant second with 13.7 percent of the vote. None \nof the other four candidates acquired more than 5 percent of the votes cast. Many of Putin's rivals expressed \nfrustration about the fact they were denied access to the state media. Meanwhile, European election observers said \nthat Russia's presidential election failed to meet democratic standards. Observers from the Organization for \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe took part in the election observation \nmission.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, President Putin said he would proceed with economic reforms and promised to \nprotect democracy. He also dismissed criticism from the United States government, and particularly that of \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, about the lack of media access afforded to his rivals. In this regard, Putin noted \nthat Powell's remarks were made because of the domestic political agenda in the United States, which included an \nelection later in the year. Putin also referenced the controversial decisions and flawed ballots in the United States \nelection process in 2000, which led to George Bush becoming president over Al Gore, saying, \"In many so-called \ndeveloped democracies there are also many problems with their own democratic and voting procedures.\"\n\nInternational Landscape: The Issue of Iraq\n\nIn early 2003, international politics took center stage as the world grappled with disarming Iraq. France and \nGermany put forth a plan aimed at averting a war with Iraq. The plan included a provision tripling the number of \nUnited Nations weapons inspectors on the ground in Iraq, the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers, and the \nestablishment of a country-wide \"no fly\" zone. Russia, which, in addition to France has veto power within the United \nNations Security Council, stated it would likely support the Franco-German plan.\n\nAs these issues were being discussed, the United Kingdom was in the process of drafting a new resolution \nauthorizing the use of force against Iraq. Such a resolution was at odds with the joint declaration developed by \nFrance, Russia and Germany, which demanded the reinforcement of weapons inspections, aided by human and \ntechnical capacity, within the wider context of peaceful Iraqi disarmament. Specifically, the declaration asserted that \nwhile Iraq must be disarmed and neutralized, war should be used only as a final measure. Russia consistently \nstated that it was in favor of the peaceful disarmament of Iraq.\n\nDiplomatic negotiations surrounding the Iraq crisis collapsed in March 2003. Efforts to modify elements of the draft \nof a second United Nations Security Council Resolution failed, despite efforts by the United Kingdom to create an \nagreement that would satisfy the misgivings of most of the Security Council members. France and Russia decried \nthe provisions for an automatic trigger resulting in war if Iraq failed to accomplish various benchmarks in \ndisarmament. Both France and Russia earlier warned that they would veto any resolution containing such \nlanguage.\n\nFollowing a meeting in the Azores between the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain (the \nsponsors of the existing United Nations Resolution 1441), Blair announced there would be a final round of informal \ndiscussions to try to resolve the impasse between the three allies and the rest of the Security Council. A deadline of \nMarch 17, 2003, was given to the rest of the Security Council to decide on a possible course of action, before \nmilitary force against Iraq would be exerted. France's Ambassador to the United Nations, Jean Marc de la Sabliere, \nresponded that in one-on-one discussions with council members, it was clearly apparent that most did not endorse \na use of force against Iraq at this time.\n\nWith no progress made in regard to a second resolution, or in building consensus among the Security Council by \nthe March 17 deadline, the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain reversed their original commitment to \nseek a vote on its passage in the Security Council and, instead, withdrew the draft resolution. In a media \nconference a week prior, United States President George W. Bush had promised a vote in the Security Council, \nwhether or not the resolution passed, stating that council members would have to \"show their cards.\" Now, in an \neffort to pursue military action without overt illegality, which the defeat of a second resolution would surely signify, \nthe allies took cover under the original United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which augured \"serious \n\n\n\nconsequences\" for Iraqi non-compliance. Experts on international jurisprudence, however, are not at all agreed on \nthis reasoning.\n\nSeveral hours after the withdrawal of the draft resolution, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced \nthe withdrawal of United Nations personnel, including weapons inspectors, from Baghdad in preparation for an \nimminent war against Iraq. Russia condemned military action against Iraq and noted that it would only jeopardize \ninternational security. The Russian Foreign Minister called for the convening of the Security Council. Apart from the \nhumanitarian and ecological disasters looming on the horizon for Iraq, the Russian Foreign Ministry also vocalized \nits belief that the current war violates the United Nations Charter. Russian officials have also been clear that they do \nnot believe in the exportation of democracy -- \"by way of tomahawks\" -- to sovereign nation states. Nevertheless, \nUnited States and United Kingdom forces launched its war against Iraq in mid-March 2003.\n\nA week into the war, the United States declared that Russian firms provided anti-combat equipment to Iraq. Russia \nemphatically denied any such involvement. The United States White House said that such provisions would be in \nviolation of United Nations sanctions and United States President George Bush telephoned Russian President \nVladimir Putin to register his displeasure over the matter. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov responded to the \ncharges by telling reporters, \"Russia rigorously observes all its international obligations and has not supplied Iraq \nwith any equipment, including military, in breach of the sanctions regime.\"\n\nThis development was only one more in a list of issues contributing to deteriorating bilateral relations between \nRussia and the United States. Another key issue was the matter of United states spy flights. In 2003, up to three U2 \nstrategic reconnaissance flights by the United States reportedly occurred along the Russian border with Georgia. \nRussia has angrily described the spy flights as a quasi-return to the Cold War period.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war in Iraq, Russia continued to urge greater United Nations participation and expressed the \nview that legitimacy in Iraq could only be realized with the crucial involvement of the international body.\n\nInternational Landscape: Kyoto Protocol\n\nIn the fall of 2004, amidst arguments of impending harm to the Russian economy, President Putin's cabinet \nendorsed the Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to limit greenhouse gas emissions across the globe. The measure was \nsent to the Duma to be ratified. Russia's endorsement effectively breathes new life into the international protocol, \nwhich had suffered a severe blow after the United States' decision (under President Bush) to withdraw from \nparticipation.\n\nInternational Landscape: Nuclear Politics\n\nIn early 2005, the nuclear issue also took center stage as Iran and Russia signed an agreement by which Moscow \nwould supply fuel for Iran's new nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Under the terms of the agreement, Iran must return \nspent nuclear fuel rods from the reactor, which had been designed and built by Russia. This condition was \nimplemented in response to growing anxiety by the United States, Israel and others about Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this development was a meeting in Slovakia between Russian President Vladimir Putin and \nUnited States President George W. Bush in which both leaders agreed that Iran should not develop nuclear \nweapons. Russia, however, refused to acquiesce to United States's pressure to completely halt cooperation with \nIran on nuclear power.\n\nFrom around 2002 through the next several years, Russia worked with several other countries within a \nmultilateral framework to deal with the threat of nuclear proliferation by North Korea.  Those talks stalled soon \nthereafter.\n\n\n\nIn mid-2006, North Korea test-fired a number of short-range missiles and one Taepodong-2 long-range missile into \nthe Sea of Japan. The situation sparked international condemnation and threats of punitive measures by some \ncountries, including sanctions.  Others, including Russia, called for a return to multilateral talks on North Korea. \n\nFor its part, North Korea said  that further missile tests would be launched.  North Korea also warned that it would \nreact strongly to punitive pressures from the international community, and it threatened to carry out an \"annihilating\" \nnuclear strike if its atomic facilities were pre-emptively hit by the United States. \n\nThe missile tests, in conjunction with dire promises of further tests and a nuclear strike, have intensified the widely-\nheld view that North Korea is a threat to global security. Moreover, these moves by North Korea effectively served \nto further isolate the country and confirm its pariah status within the international community.  \n\nThe matter resulted in the passage of a resolution by the United Nations Security Council members, including \nRussia, mandating inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or \ntransfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of \nfunds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution 1718 was the \nChapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via military force.\n\nDecember 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  \nNorth Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their interest in returning to the \nnegotiating table after a year-long hiatus.  While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was \nwelcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of \nforging a resolution amenable to all parties.\n\nBy February 2007, the multilateral discussions were ongoing.  Progress was quickly made during the six-party talks \nin Beijing when North Korea agreed to move closer toward the position of disarmament.  Of particular interest was \nan agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of \nthe ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft \nagreement, which had been drafted by China,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea. \nOn February 13, 2007, it was announced that concurrence on the matter had been reached.  Yet to be seen was \nwhether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North Korea would fully \ncomply with the provisions of the deal. \n\nDevolving Relations with the United States\n\nMeanwhile, relations with the United States took center stage in 2005 when United States Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice visited Russia. During her visit, Rice took time to criticize President Vladimir Putin's political \nweight by suggesting that he had too much personal power. In this regard, Rice expressed concern over the lack of \nan independent media in Russia, and she also repudiated the accumulation of political power that Putin had \ngathered since taking office.\n\nA year later in May 2006, on the heels of sharp criticism by United States Vice President Dick Cheney of Russia's \nhuman rights record, the Kommersant business newspaper said that the matter augured the start of a new Cold \nWar.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offered no comment on the content of Cheney's position, however, \nhe criticized the forum in Lithuania where Cheney spoke.  He noted that such meetings were convened for the \npurpose of uniting a cadre of interest groups against someone.  Meanwhile, former Soviet President Mikhail \nGorbachev said that Cheney's speech appeared to be \"a provocation and interference in Russia's internal affairs in \nterms of its content, form and place.\" \n\nThe matter preceded a scheduled meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President \nGeorge W. Bush at a key industrial summit to be convened in St. Petersburg.  At that meeting in July 2006, during a \n\n\n\njoint press address by Putin and Bush, the American president called on Russia to democratize, and said that he \nhoped that the country would enjoy the kind of freedom now being enjoyed by Iraq. Putin responded to this \nstatement by asserting that the example of Iraq -- now embroiled in what some were calling a civil war -- was not \none he thought Russia should emulate.\n\nRelations with the United States would further be strained as a result of foreign investment issues (discussed below \nunder the title \"The Yukos Story\") and a controversial missile plan for eastern Europe (discussed below under the \ntitle \"Recent Developments\").\n\nThe Yukos Story\n\nPerhaps most important to the Bush administration in the United States, however, was the matter of foreign \ninvestors' rights.  Openness to foreign investment, for the Bush administration, has been viewed as a sign of market \ncapitalism, which it has linked with notions of freedom. By contrast, the Bush administration has looked unfavorably \non government power in the realm of business. In this regard, the Bush administration would apparently be \nwatching closely the fraud and tax evasion trial of the founder of the Yukos oil company, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. \nSome, perhaps even including those within the Bush administration, had been of the mind that the case against \nKhodorkovsky was manufactured purely to punish him for his political ambitions. Naturally, those in the Kremlin \nviewed the situation quite differently. Nevertheless, the verdict, due in April 2005, was to be watched closely by \nWashington.\n\nIn early May 2005, no verdict had been given in the Yukos case against Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Then, on May 16, \n2005, a Russian judge adjourned court midway through the verdict in the trial of the Yukos former chief, Mikhail \nKhodorkovsky, following a reiteration of the indictments. The verdict stage of the trial was to resume the next day. \nKhodorkovsky's lawyers said they expected a guilty verdict since they viewed all the charges as being political. \nThey also criticized the Russian judicial process. Several of Khodorkovsky's supporters were seen on the streets \naround the court. Although the anti-Khodorkovsky contingent was less visible, public opinion of Russia, according to \nrecent surveys, showed little sympathy for the Russian tycoon. The surveys contained little good news for either \nprivate corporations or the government; indeed, they also showed the public losing trust in both arenas. By May 31, \n2005, Khodorkovsky was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in jail for fraud and tax evasion.\n\nThe Yukos issue came to the fore again in mid-2006 and again evoked questions about Russia's economic and \npolitical position.  Was Russia's treatment of Yukos a sign of some kind of backward slide toward government \nauthoritarianism?  This was a question that captured the attention of many in the West, and particularly, the United \nStates.  \n\nIn July 2006, Yukos commenced court action against the Russian state energy firm Rosneft.\n\nThe court action was oriented toward stopping Rosneft's flotation on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), which was \nexpected to be Russia's biggest initial public offering (IPO) and one of the largest in the world.  Yukos petitioned the \ncourt to impose a temporary injunction on the sale of shares, while a full investigation of the flotation was carried \nout. Yukos argued that Rosneft's key oil producing subsidiary,  Yuganskneftgaz, had been taken from Yukos by the \nRussian government. In fact, Rosneft purchased  Yuganskneftgaz in 2004, after it was seized from Yukos and was \nbeing auctioned for the purpose of paying unpaid taxes.  The Economist (in the July 12-21, 2006 edition), \ncontended that the auction was rigged.  Regardless, Rosneft responded to Yukos' court action by saying that its \nfloat would not be impeded; it also announced that its main share buyers would include BP of the United Kingdom, \nPetronas of  Malaysia, and CNPN of China. Meanwhile, Rosneft was already trading on the Moscow market.  For its \npart, the  London Stock Exchange said that it intended to list Rosneft  unless it was blocked by the courts.\n\n\n\nAlso in July 2006, creditors of Yukos voted convincingly in favor of the liquidation of company assets.  The issue \nwould now go before a bankruptcy court in August 2006 for consideration, where it was expected that the court \nwould appoint a supervisor to sell Yukos' assets.  The creditors also soundly rejected a company plan aimed at \nrescuing the company from its likely financial demise.  Among the creditors have been Russian tax agencies and \nthe state-owned oil company, Rosneft, which was discussed above and which was likely to benefit handily from the \nsale of Yukos' refineries.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2006, the Russian firm Yukos was declared bankrupt by a court in Moscow.  The court decision \neffectively ends the company's bid to survive. The next step was expected to be liquidation and allocation of the \nfirm's remaining assets.\n\nDomestic Political Tensions\n\nIn late December 2005, Economic Advisor Andrei Illarionov offered his resignation to Russian President Vladimir \nPutin.  His withdrawal from service as a political aid to the Russian leader was intended to protest what he \nperceived as the retrenchment of political freedom. Illarionov charged that Russia  was now being run by state \ncorporations and as a result, the  country was no longer politically free. Illarionov said to journalists, \"It is one thing \nto work in a country that is partly free. It is another thing when the political system has  changed, and the country \nhas stopped being free and democratic.\" He also noted that the economic model of the Russian state had \nchanged.  He went on to suggest that the expression of his viewpoint had also been curtailed. As such, he asserted \nthat remaining in his post would have been impossible.\n\nIllarionov had been a strenuous critic of Putin and the Russian government for some time.  Indeed, a year earlier, \nhe referred to the Russian government's actions against  Yukos as being inappropriate.  Still, the timing of \nIllarionov's latest remarks was unfortunate for the government since they were uttered just as Russia was about to \nassume the presidency of the G-8 group of industrialized countries. Nevertheless,  Viktor Chernomyrdin, the \nambassador to Ukraine and a former Russian prime  minister, eschewed Illarionov's criticisms of the Russian \ngovernment.  In an interview with Interfax News Agency, he characterized Illarionov as malicious and \"overly  \nnegative.\"  He went on to state that it had been a mistake to keep Illarionov at the Kremlin for as long as he had \nbeen in that post.  Indeed, several observers have suggested that Illarionov had little remaining influence on the \nKremlin for some time.  In fact, many of his duties at the Kremlin had become increasingly limited and his role as \nRussia's representative to the G-8 had ended.  Still, he was never entirely pushed out since his presence appeased \nWestern concerns about  increasing state control over economic policy.\n\nEnergy Politics\n\nIn other developments, Russia was embroiled in a dispute with Ukraine over a gas deal in 2006.  The Ukrainian \nEnergy Minister Ivan Plachkov traveled to  Moscow to try to resolve the dispute ahead of the expiration of the \nnegotiating deadline.  The issue has revolved around the price of gas.  The Russian gas entity, Gazprom, raised the \nprice of 1,000 cubic meters of gas from $50 to $230 -- a rate that would  involve the quadrupling of gas prices for \nUkraine.  Ukraine refused to pay while Gazprom threatened to cut off Ukraine's supplies completely if a new \nagreement was not forged by the start of 2006. Indeed, Russia said that no new  proposals would be advanced and \nthat Ukraine should pay market rates.  For its part, Ukraine has said that while it would agree to payment of market \nrates, such increases should be introduced in a phased cycle over a period of several years.\n\nWith no progress made in forging an agreement, Gazprom effectively cut off energy supplies to Ukraine. Because \nGazprom supplies a full 20 percent of all the gas consumed by the European Union, the cut-off of Ukraine's gas \nprovisions led to a shortage of gas supplies elsewhere across Europe in the first days of 2006. Countries directly \naffected by the situation were themselves pumping less gas to their own customers down the line.\n\nEven as  Ukraine lost 100 percent of its Russian gas supplies, Moldova was also cut off after refusing to go along \nwith the price increase proposed by Gazprom.  In Hungary, gas supplies from Russia were down by 40 percent, \nalthough supplies were later restored.  In Poland, gas supplies from Russia decreased by around 14 percent, \n\n\n\nleading the country to consider gas supplies from a different pipeline. In Austria, Slovakia and Romania, gas \nsupplies from Russia decreased by around 33 percent, however, Austrian sources said that the gas flow had since \nbeen normalized. In France, which is highly dependent on Russian gas, supplies encountered a 25 percent to 30 \npercent fall.  In Germany, where 30 percent of all gas provisions come from Russia,  there was also a reported \ndecrease.  German authorities called on Moscow to \"act responsibly\" in the face of the energy challenges facing the \nregion.\n\nIn response, Gazprom announced it would carry out checks on gas volumes and that it would utilize \"all possible \nmeasures\" to ensure that Western consumers continued to receive gas as per contractual agreements.  The \nRussian government said that it would pump more gas to Europe -- a move intended to compensate for  gas \n\"stolen\" by Ukraine.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2006, Alexander Medvedev, the deputy head of Gazprom, alleged that Ukraine had stolen 100 million \ncubic meters of gas. Ukraine denied the accusation that it had siphoned off $25 million worth of gas from the \npipeline crossing its territory after Russia cut off its gas supply.  Still, Ukraine's Fuel and Energy Minister, Ivan \nPlachkov, asserted that Ukraine had the right to a portion of the gas transported by the pipeline that exports \nRussian gas across its territory. Indeed, that pipeline carries 90 percent of Gazprom's exports across Europe.\n\nUkrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said he was willing to enter a process of international arbitration to resolve \nthe dispute.  In this regard,  European Union Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said in a media interview that \nhe had called on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table. He also described the complexity of the \nsituation, carefully noting that no one was to blame.  On Jan. 3, 2006, ahead of a meeting of energy officials from \nthe European Union, Russia notified the European Commission of its opinion of the gas dispute with Ukraine.\n\nAt the geopolitical level, the Ukrainian government in Kiev suggested that it was being punished by the Russian \ngovernment in Moscow for trying to develop stronger ties with the West.  Relations between Russia and Ukraine \nhave been strained ever since  President Yushchenko came to power.  As a pro-Western politician, Yushchenko \nhas appeared to steer the country out of Russia's sphere of influence.\n\nRussia and Ukraine were eventually able to forge an agreement that satisfied both parties and ensured that gas \nsupplies were not hampered.\n\nIn December 2006, tensions rose between Azerbaijan and Russia  over energy supplies.  At issue was the \nproposed price increase for gas supplies to Azerbaijan by Russia's Gazprom.\n\nIn reaction to Gazprom's decision to more than double the price of its supplies, President Aliyev of Azerbaijan \nthreatened to reduce his country's oil exports to Russia.  To this end, Aliyev said, \"I have decided to find a way out \nof the situation with minimum losses for Azerbaijan, and at the same time with dignity. I cannot allow Azerbaijan to \nbe turned into a country subject to elements of commercial blackmail.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia's Gazprom explained that the new price of gas was the result of an end to the subsidies that \nhad once benefitted former Soviet republics. As well, Russia's Gazprom maintained that the price of gas was now \ndictated by the global marketplace and was bereft of political machinations.\n\nEarlier,  Georgia had also reacted angrily to the price increase.  Indeed, Georgia accused Russia of raising gas \nprices as a punite measure against its pro-Western policies. However, because it was unable to secure an \nalternative supply of gas, and with Gazprom threatening to cut off supplies without agreement on the updated price \nof gas, Georgia eventually acquiesced to the new arrangement.\n\nLate 2006 and early 2007 saw a similar imbroglio involving Russia and Belarus.  In late 2006, an agreement was \nforged in which Belarus was largely compelled to accept Russian gas supplies at double the previous price.  \nBelarus subsequently retaliated by imposing a new tax on Russian oil shipments that traversed the country, while \nRussia reacted by refusing to pay the new taxes. \n\n\n\nThe situation became increasingly heated in the second week of January 2007 when the Russian state-owned \npipeline firm Transneft closed the Druzhba or \"Friendship\" pipe.  Russia also accused Belarus of siphoning off oil \nsupplies as an illicit means of payment for unpaid taxes and duties.  Representatives of the two countries held talks \nand the situation was eventually resolved.  The flow of Russian oil resumed, along with assurances being advanced \nthat such stoppages would not occur again. \n\nThe situation was reminiscent of Russia's earlier argument with Ukraine (discussed above) and various other \ncountries in Eastern Europe, which was also spurred by the increased price of gas supplies.  As before, Russia said \nthat the price increase was in keeping with market rates, while other countries complained that the new pricing \nstructure was untenable. \n\nRegional Concerns\n\nRussia has had to deal with its post-Soviet relationship with former republics.  For example, in the case of  Estonia, \ntensions have dominated the relationship. First, nearly 30 percent of Estonia's total population is ethnic Russian. \nEstonia's citizenship laws - which require knowledge of Estonia - have angered Russia, as it views these laws as \ndiscriminatory against ethnic Russians in Estonia. Second, Estonia has been investigating and prosecuting former \nSoviet officials for alleged crimes against humanity during World War II and the Soviet occupation thereafter. \nRussia resents what it sees as a fervent pursuit of former Soviet officials in the face of a less than equally fervent \npursuit of Estonians who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. Estonia's tendency to give convicted war \ncriminals suspended sentences (as opposed to actual prison sentences) has somewhat ameliorated the situation.\n\nIn 2000, relations between Estonia and Russia took center stage as the two countries expelled diplomats from \nwithin their own borders over a spying imbroglio.\n\nIn March 2005, there was something of a diplomatic flap when President Ruutel decided to decline an invitation to \nattend the celebrations in Moscow scheduled for May to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II. \nNevertheless, in May 2005, the two countries signed a treaty delimiting their shared border.\n\nThe treaty was ratified a month later by parliament, however, an amendment was introduced in the language of the \nlegislation that referenced Soviet occupation.  The Russian government in Moscow said it would not accept such \nlanguage and withdrew from the agreement in June 2005.\n\nIn February 2007, the Estonian parliament passes legislation banning the display of monuments valorizing the \nperiod of Soviet rule.  The law effectively set in motion a series of actions, that would ultimately result in political \nunrest within Estonia and served to strain bilateral relations.\n\nMeanwhile, Chechnya has been the most pressing regional concern for Russia in recent years.\n\nIn recent years, Chechnya continued to be a major consideration and the core of Putin's fight against terrorism. The \ndeath of the central figure within the Chechen resistance in July 2006, however, functioned as a literal coup for \nPutin's government.  (See the Appendix of this review for more about the situation in Chechnya.)\n\nChechnya aside, President Putin still faces other geopolitical problems. There are an estimated 3,400 rebels \nscattered throughout Chechnya and the area around Georgia and the Pankisi Gorge has become a strategic area \nfor the rebels. Tensions between the two countries increased in tandem with Russia's accusation that Georgia has \nallowed Chechen rebels to move freely and enact terrorist attacks in the area. Russia also claims that after carrying \nout attacks, the rebels usually flee across the border into Georgia, including the Pankisi Gorge, where they enjoy a \nsafe haven. For its part, Georgia accuses Russia of violating its airspace as it attempts to deal with the rebel threat. \n\n\n\nAlthough joint patrols have been established to deal with this transborder issue, at the time of writing, there was no \nclear resolution. It remains unclear how Putin intends to handle the situation in the long-term, but international \nobservers have expressed increased concern.\n\nRelations with Georgia have also been deleteriously affected by the existence of two Soviet-era bases in that \ncountry (set to be closed in 2008), tensions over Russian ties to separatist movements in South Ossetia and \nAbkhazia, and the new Georgian government's pro-Western stances that would orient the country away from \nRussian influence.\n\nThese issues came to the fore in September 2006  following a diplomatic imbroglio between Russia and \nGeorgia over spying.\n\nAt issue was the arrest of five Russian officers in Georgia on the basis of allegations of spying.  The Russian \ngovernment in Moscow demanded their release, however, the Georgian government in Tbilisi was itself compelling \nthe handover of a sixth Russian officer.  That officer was apparently within Russian army headquarters, which was \nsurrounded by police in the Georgian capital. The Georgian Interior Ministry claimed that it had evidence showing \nthat the Russian officers had been \" personally carrying out intelligence  activities.\"  It also linked Russia with \nseparatist activities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nIn response, Russia ordered the withdrawal of diplomatic officials, including the Russian ambassador,  from \nGeorgia using emergency aircrafts.  Russia additionally urged its citizens to refrain from travel to Georgia and \nstopped processing visa requests from Georgian nationals.  Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that \nGeorgia's actions were a manifestation of an anti-Russian policy and he warned that he would refer the matter to \nthe United Nations.\n\nThe situation was not helped by Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili's dismissal of Russia's reaction as being \n\"hysteria.\"\n\nBy the start of October 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin entered the fray, saying that  Georgia's arrest of  the \nRussian army officers for spying was tantamount to \"an act of state terrorism with hostage-taking.\"  His remarks \ncame following a meeting with the security council of his government and a  day after his government said that it \nwould halt its scheduled withdrawal of troops from Georgia.  The presence of Russian troops in Georgia had been a \nsource of consternation for Georgians and their exit in 2008 had been highly-anticipated.  Georgian Foreign Minister \nGela Bezhuashvili responded to that bit of news by saying that his government expected Russia to honor its prior \ncommitment on troop withdrawals. \n\nOn October 2, 2006, Georgia said that it was releasing the Russian military officers.  The situation was not \nautomatically resolved, however, as Russia went forward with sanctions against Georgia, including the \naforementioned travel restrictions, but also including deportations of Georgians and raids on Georgian-owned \nbusinesses.  Georgia protested Russia's actions, with Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili characterizing it as \nbeing beyond xenophobia.  On October 9, 2006, Georgia said that it would turn back any aircraft with deported \nGeorgians from Russia.\n\nBy March 2007, ties between the two counties -- Georgia and Russia -- were not helped by the poor medical \nconditions and deaths of several ethnic Georgians who were deported from Russia during the aforementioned \ndiplomatic imbroglio, which started with the detainment of Russian officers on charges of spying in the fall of 2006.  \nGeorgians expressed outrage at the deaths of the deportees, and the Georgian government in the spring of 2007 \nlaunched charges of human rights violations against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  \nThe Georgian Justice Ministry said in a statement, \"The lawsuit is based on hundreds of cases of flagrant abuses of \nthe human rights of Georgian citizens and ethnic Georgians by the Russian Federation during their deportations.\" \n\n\n\nRussia responded by saying that it believed that it had the right to deport illegal migrants, and as such, it was \ndoubtful that the court would consider the case.  A spokesperson for the  Russian Foreign Ministry, Mikhail Kamynin \nsaid, \"Actions of this kind are not conducive to the normalization of relations between Russia and Georgia.\" \n\nOn Aug. 22, 2007, Georgia accused Russia of violating its airspace for a second time within weeks.  The Georgian \nForeign Ministry said that a Russian fighter jet had flown a few miles into its territory, according to tracking data \nfrom the country's air defense system.  The Russian government in Moscow denied the incursion saying that its \nplanes were not flying close to the border with Georgia on the day in question.  The incident followed a similar \nepisode earlier in the month when Georgia accused Russia of violating its border and dropping a missile close to \nthe Georgian capital of Tbilisi.  Russia vociferously denied that accusation as well.  Two days after the second claim \nby the Caucasus country that Russia had violated its border, the Georgian Interior Ministry announced that it had \nfired on what it claimed to be a Russian aircraft after it allegedly violated Georgian airspace.  Russia again denied \nthe claim and noted that there were no reports of missing Russian aircraft.\n\nEditor's Note: These incidences have been indicative of a further devolution of poor relations between the two \ncountries.  In the background, various issues have worked to sour Russian-Georgian relations. Of grave importance \nhas been the Georgian region of Abkhazia, which has been held by Russian-backed separatists.  Georgia views \nRussia's decision to back the separatists as a virtual annexation.  As well, the two countries have been involved in \nimbroglios involving spying, the expulsion of ethnic Georgians from Russia as a result, as well as a dispute over the \nprice of Russian gas to Georgia.\n\nAnother source of tension comes from Russian accusations that Georgia is hiding Chechen militants in the Pankisi \nGorge area, the home of Chechen kin people, the Kists. \n\nMeanwhile, there has also been tension with Moldova over the presence of Russian troops in the breakaway Trans-\nDnestr region where there is a large number of ethnic Russians living. In March 2005, at the time of the Moldovan \nelection, about 100 Russians were barred from entering the country. While the Russians claimed they were election \nmonitors, Moldovan authorities said they were not registered as such and they were likely to disrupt the election. A \nmonth prior, several Russians were expelled from Moldova under suspicion of spying, while Russia threatened \nsanctions against Moldova. The region returned to the political landscape in March 2006 when  new customs \nregulations were instituted by Moldova requiring exporters in Trans-Dniester to register with the Moldovan \nauthorities.  Officials in Trans-Dniester administration said that the new rules constituted a blockade of sorts.  \nMonths later in July 2006, an explosion on a bus in the city of Tiraspol  left several people dead and around 20 \npeople injured. \n\nViolence and Intrigue\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2006, a explosion in a market in the Russian capital city of Moscow demolished a two-storey building \nand left 10 people dead and over 40 people injured.  Among those killed were two children and six foreign \nnationals.  At first, it was surmised that the explosion was caused by a faulty gas cylinder, however, police \nsubsequently said that a bomb had been placed in a bag and deposited inside a cafe. Security forces said that a \nsimple bomb device was used and they alleged that the blast was the result of a gang feud.  Gang feuding has \nbeen the stated cause behind a number of small-scale market bombings in the past. Of course, Chechen rebels \nhave also used bombings at markets to further their cause.  As such, there was no conclusion about who was \nresponsible.  Nevertheless, two people were detained for questioning in regard to the incident. \n\nIn mid-September 2006, Andrei Kozlov, the first deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank, was shot to death by \ntwo gunmen.  The motive for the apparent murder remained unknown at the time of writing, but there was \nspeculation that it was a contract-type assassination.  Prosecutors surmised that Kozlov may have been killed \n\n\n\nbecause of his leadership in the decision to revoke the licenses of several banks believed to be guilty of money \nlaundering.  The move by the Central Bank to revoke these licenses was likely intended to deter corruption in a \ncountry seeking to build better transparency while curtailing corruption.  The killing of Kozlov, however, suggested \nthat such efforts were likely to be resisted, perhaps even with deadly force.\n\nOctober 2006 was marked by the murder of a prominent journalist, Anna  Politkovskaya, who had been a strong \ncritic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya.  See \"Appendix: Chechnya\" for details.\n\nIn  November 2006, a former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, died in a hospital in London.  He was the victim of \nan apparent poisoning, according to reports by British investigators.  Indeed, traces of the radioactive substance  \npolonium-210 were found in his body.  Further traces were subsequently found at various locations in London, \nwhich were presumed to have been frequented by  Litvinenko.\n\nSpeculation as to who was responsible for his death was ongoing.  As a vocal critic of Putin and the Kremlin, and \nalso because of his recent work investigating the aforementioned murder of an anti-Putin journalist, the immediate \nassumption was that the Russian government was responsible.  The fact that Litvinenko blamed Putin for the \npoisoning -- from his hospital bed -- only added to this particular theory.  But the slow,  painful, and rather exotic  \nnature of the poisoning suggested that the incident was not the usual case of politically-motivated assassination.\n\nFor its part, the Kremlin  rejected any intimations that the Russian government was involved in  Litvinenko's death \nand, instead, encouraged the investigation by law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom (U.K.).  To this end, \na spokesperson from President Putin's office said, \"Any death is always a tragedy. Now it's up to U.K. law \nenforcement agencies to investigate what happened.\"\n\nOther theories were beginning to surface about who might have orchestrated Litvinenko's death.  Among them was \nthe notion that rogue elements of the Russian intelligence service may have been responsible.  A similar theory \npostulated that former KGB -- now carrying out more shady activities -- might have been responsible. Given \nLitvinenko's past role as an agent investigating corruption, there was the suggestion that he may have been the \nvictim of a contract killing carried out by enemies made during that period. Yet another rationale centered on the \npossibility that the poisoning was carried out for the purpose of implicating the Russian government, presumably to \ndiscredit it. \n\nBy early December 2006, several British Airways airliners were said to be contaminated with the radioactive \nsubstance that caused Litvinenko's death.  As well, an Italian contact of Litvinenko, Mario Scaramella, was \nhospitalized after traces of polonium-210 was found in his body.  Scaramella had reportedly met with the former \nagent on the very day  he [Litvinenko] was taken ill.  Consequently, the investigation into the matter was widening \nwell beyond British shores, according to British Home Secretary, John Reid.  In fact, counter-terrorism experts were \nexpected to travel to Russia to advance the investigation.\n\nIn May 2007, the British authorities named a former Russian KGB officer as the likely person behind the poisoning \ndeath Litvinenko.\n\nSir Ken MacDonald, the director of public prosecutions in the United Kingdom, said Andrei Lugovoi  should be held \nresponsible for the murder.  During a press conference, McDonald said,  \"I have today concluded that the evidence \nsent to us by the police is sufficient to charge Andrei Lugovoi with the murder of Mr. Litvinenko by deliberate \npoisoning.\"\n\nIn response,  Lugovoi denied  being involved in the death of Litvinenko  and said that the accusations being made \nagainst him were \"politically motivated.\"  To this end, he said in interviews with the Russian media, \"I consider that \nthis decision to be political, I did not kill Litvinenko, I have no relation to his death and I can only express well-\nfounded distrust for the so-called basis of proof collected by British judicial officials.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a power struggle was unfolding between the United Kingdom and Russia  over the possible extradition \nof Lugovoi.  While the British authorities intended to formally request that Lugovoi be extradited, the Kremlin was \nsaying that the extradition of Russian nationals to foreign jurisdiction was unconstitutional.  At the same time, \nRussian authorities suggested that there was room for the prosecution of a Russian citizen accused of a crime in \nanother country  within Russia, using \"evidence provided by the foreign state.\"  A spokesperson from the office of \nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair  countered by noting that Russia had signed the European Union 1957 convention \non extradition. \n\nIn July 2007, Russian Prosecutor-General Yuri Chayka ruled against the extradition of a former KGB agent Andrei \nLugovoi, whom the British authorities said was responsible for Litvinenko's death.\n\nChayka said that extradition of Lugovoi to the United Kingdom would contradict the Russian constitution. \n\nNow with the official Russian decision on the extradition issued, the British authorities responded by expelling four \ndiplomats from the Russian embassy in London.  The British Foreign Secretary David Miliband noted that his \ncountry was also reviewing its cooperation with Russia on a number of issues.  Soon thereafter,  Russian Deputy \nForeign Minister  Alexander Grushko noted that the expulsion of its diplomats from London could very well hinder \nbilateral cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts.  As well, Russian announced that it would also expel four staffers \nfrom the British embassy in Moscow.  The United Kingdom responded to this action by noting that Russia decision \nto retaliate in kind was \"not justified.\"\n\nConsequently British-Russian relations were at one of their lowest points in recent history. \n\nOther Developments\n\nApril 2007 saw an anti-Kremlin rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  The Moscow rally ended in some small \nclashes with authorities as well as some arrests. The St. Petersburg rally was contained within a square at the city \ncenter since riot police prevented demonstrators from marching in the streets.  Again, there were small clashes with \npolice and the arrests of some opposition figures, including Eduard Limonov, the leader of the radical National \nBolshevik party, Andrey Sidelnikov, the leader of the Pora youth movement, and Olga Kurnosova, the local head of \nUnited Civil Front.\n\nThe rallies were arranged by these and other opposition groups working under the auspices of the \"Other Russia\" \ncoalition.  They have accused President Vladimir Putin of political repression.  In response, President  Putin denied \ncharges that he has tried to curtail democracy and instead said that the opposition forces were attempting to \ndestabilize the country.\n\nOn April 23, 2007, Boris Yeltsin -- Russia's first democratic leader -- died due to heart failure at the age of 76 \nyears.  Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly telephoned Yeltsin's widown to convey his condolences  Putin \nalso declared a national day of mourning in honor of his predecessor.  In a national address, Putin said, \"We will do \neverything we can to ensure that the memory of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, his noble thoughts and his words 'take \ncare of Russia' serve as a moral and political benchmark for us.\"\n\nThen, on April 25, 2007, at a solemn state funeral at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow, Yeltsin was laid \nto rest.  It was the first religious funeral for a Kremlin leader since the 1890s. Russian and foreign dignitaries, \nincluding former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev, former United States President Bill Clinton, former United \nKingdom Prime Minister John Major, and the British Duke of York, were in attendance. \n\nYeltsin was noted for being Russia's first democratic leader, as well as being the driving force behind the \nestablishment of the new Russian federation in the post-Soviet era.  But he has also been associated with the \n\n\n\neconomic chaos that plagued Russia in the immediate period after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  As such, \nYeltsin's legacy will likely be a matter of debate among historians torn between the notion of Yeltsin as the driving \nforce behind democratic change in Russia, and Yeltsin  as the force behind the rise of the wealthy oligarchs. His \nmilitary campaign against independent activists in Chechnya, which led to the razing of Chechen towns, the killing \nof tens of thousands of civilians, and the horror of the international community, were collectively expected to be \nmatters of grave consternation for decades to come.\n\nAlso in April 2007, Russia responded negatively to plans by the Bush administration in the United States (U.S.) to \ndevelop a missile defense system in eastern Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin decried the notion, \nindicating that he viewed such a missile system as being more that simply a defense plan.  To this end, he said, \n\"This is not just a defense system, this is part of the U.S.  nuclear weapons system.\"  President  Putin went so far \nas to warn the U.S. that its plans in this regard would run the risk of mutual destruction, saying, \"The threat of \ncausing mutual damage and even destruction increases many times.\" Making clear its hard-line opposition to the \nnotion of a U.S. missile defense system, President Putin also threatened to withdraw participation in a treaty limiting \nconventional weaponry in Europe.  \n\nNATO responded to Russia's threat to suspend its membership in the 1990  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) \nwith its own concern.  Indeed, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer made it clear that the treaty was a \nkeystone of security and stability in Europe.\n\nWith the United States planning to construct missile defense facilities in Europe, Russia had already expressed its \nopposition to such a plan.  But in early June 2007, ahead of the G-8 summit of key world leaders, Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin warned that his country could be forced to point weapons at Europe for the first time since \nthe end of the Cold War.  Russia also announced that it had tested an RS-24 ballistic missile a week prior.\n\nBoth moves appeared oriented toward the maintenance of \"strategic balance\" in the region. To this end, Putin \npointed to the fact that the United States had already altered the strategic balance by withdrawing from the anti-\nballistic missile treaty in 2002.  In an interview published in the Italian newspaper, Corriere Della Sera, he made the \nRussian position clear by asserting, \"If the American nuclear potential grows in European territory, we have to give \nourselves new targets in Europe.\"\n\nThe climate of bilateral relations thawed somewhat at the summit when United States President Bush said,  \n\"They're [Russians] not a military threat.\"  He also called for the United States to work with Russia in dealing \ncooperatively on the issue.\n\nThen, Russian President Putin proposed an alternate solution to the missile defense issue when he suggested that \nboth countries utilize the radar system at Gabala in Azerbaijan to develop a shield that would cover Europe.  In this \nplan, incoming missiles from hostile countries could be detected.\n\nPutin noted that \"This work should be multi-faceted with the engagement of the states concerned in Europe.\"  He \nalso added that if his country and this United States worked together in an open manner to develop missile defense \ncapabilities, \"then we will have no problems.\"\n\nBush responded to the proposal by saying that it was an interesting option and noted that he and Putin would \nengage on a \"strategic dialogue\" on the subject in a forthcoming visit of his Russian counterpart to the United \nStates.  Bush' senior advisor on national security, Stephen Hadley's characterization of the Russian proposal as \"a \npositive development\" augured a possible productive resolution to the matter.\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2007, missile talks between the United States (U.S.) and Russia ended in failure with no resolution was \nin sight.  U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described the bilateral talks with Russia saying, \"We discussed \na range of proposals we hope they will accept.\" Her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said that the proposals \n\n\n\nrequired study and in the interim, the U.S. should not work on the missile defense system.  But the U.S. rejected \nRussia's request to put an end to the plan, with Rice asserting that discussions with Poland and the Czech Republic \non the deployment of system would go on as anticipated.  Responding to the U.S. position, Putin  said, \"One day \nyou and I may decide that missile defense systems can be deployed on the Moon, but before we get there the \npossibility of reaching an agreement may be lost because you will have implemented your own plans.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates argued that that the missile defense system  was not directed at \nRussia but at rogue states including Iran and North Korea.  However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said \nthat the very idea of the missile defense shield system was based on the false assumption that Iran presented a \nnuclear threat.  Lavrov also criticized the U.S. for hinting at the use of force against Iran, saying that  such  an \napproach contravenes against the notion of a negotiated solution to the Iranian problem.  Russia also reiterated its \nposition that  its own early warning radar systems  in Azerbaijan could easily be used by the U.S.  But Gates \nresponded that radar was incapable of guiding interceptor missiles.\n\nU.S. intransigence on the matter thus paved the way for Russia to make good on its earlier threat to withdraw its \nparticipation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which was aimed at limiting conventional \nweaponry in Europe.  Russia also warned that it could withdraw its participation in the 20-year old Intermediate \nRange Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which limits both U.S. and Russian short and medium range missiles, and \nresulted in the elimination of thousands of missiles in both countries.\n\nParliamentary Elections of 2007\n\nSeptember 2007 saw  Russian President Vladimir Putin dissolve government following a request from Prime \nMinister Mikhail Fradkov.  Putin soon put forth a new name for the position of head of government.  That person \nwas Viktor Zubkov -- the  financial intelligence chief  who had been at the helm of the anti-money laundering entity \ncalled  Rosfinmonitoring. \n\nFor his part,  following Putin's announcement of his appointment,  Zubkov told legislators  that he intended to form a \ngovernment in which the composition would likely change from the current membership.  After his meeting with \nlawmakers, Zubkov met with members of the media and said that there was a possibility that he might eventually \nrun for the presidency in forthcoming elections, which would result in a successor to the widely-popular Putin.  To \nthat end, Zubkov said, \"If I achieve something as prime minister then I do not rule out that possibility.\" Zubkov's \nnomination was scheduled to be confirmed in parliament on Sept. 14, 2007.\n\nWith Russian President Vladimir Putin expected to step down from office, attention shifted to whether or not he \nwould try to remain in the domain of politics.  Because he could not run for another term as president, there was \nspeculation about what his role might be.\n\nIn October 2007, a hint of Putin's aspirations was revealed when he talked about the possibility of running for a seat \nin parliament as a candidate of the United Russia party in forthcoming elections.  Should such a path be pursued, \nand assuming that his United Russia party won the parliamentary elections, Putin would be well-positioned to take \non the role of prime minister.  As discussion was evoked about this possible path, Putin said, \"Heading the \ngovernment is realistic, but it is too early to consider it.\"\n\nOn Dec. 2, 2007, voters went to the polls in Russia to cast ballots in the country's parliamentary elections.  Results \nshowed an overwhelming victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, amidst accusations \nthat the election was not carried out in a fair and fully competitive manner.\n\nNevertheless, with the majority of ballots counted, Putin's United Russia had 64.1 percent of the vote share.  The \nCommunists carried about 11.6 percent of the vote share and were poised to secure some seats in parliament as \nwell.  The right-leaning Liberal Party of Russia appeared to have garnered around 8.2 percent of the vote, while A \nFair Russia (Mothers/Pensioners/Life) acquired approximately 7.8 percent.  Other parties won the remaining vote \n\n\n\nshare but were unable to cross the seven percent threshold needed to enter parliament.  Since the  Liberal Party \nand A Fair Russia were both allied with United Russia, parties aligned with the Kremlin were expected to hold up to \n348 seats in the 450-seat Gosudarstvennaya Duma (State Duma).  Should that number hold steady, the Kremlin \nwould likely have a constitutional majority -- that is, control over enough seats in parliament to push through \nconstitutional changes.\n\nThe Communists said the election outcome was fraudulent, however, the Central Electoral Commission dismissed \nthis claim.\n\nCommunist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, said, \"We do not trust these figures announced by the central \nelections commission and we will conduct a parallel count.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the leader of victorious United Russia, Boris Gryzlov,  acknowledged that there \nmay have been some violations, but nothing significant enough to place the final result in doubt.  To this end, he \nsaid, \"They in no way put in doubt the final result. The fact that these violations have been registered shows that we \nhave a transparent ballot.\"\n\nDelays in the procurement of necessary visas allowed only a limited number of monitors from the Organization for \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the election.  Nevertheless, the OSCE subsequently \nissued a statement characterizing the election as \"not fair\" and noting that it did not meet European standards, \nalthough it did not go so far as to issue charges of fraudulence.  Instead, the group noted that  the election \"took \nplace in an atmosphere which seriously limited political competition\" and that \"there was not a level political playing \nfield.\"  For his part, Putin asserted that the poll was both \"legitimate\" and a vote of the public's confidence  in him.\n\nIndeed, the landslide election victory for United Russia appeared to be  illustrative of popular support for Putin's \nleadership. United Russia leader, Gryzlov noted that the election was \"a referendum on President Putin so I think \nwe can say he has won a victory.\"\n\nWith such resounding ratification, it appeared likely that even after the end of Putin's presidential term in 2008, and \neven though constitutional provisions prevented him from  running for another successive term as president,  he \ncould nonetheless remain on the political scene.  Indeed, the parliamentary victory for his party opened up a path \nfor Putin in which his leadership role could well transition from that of head of state to head of government. As noted \nabove, current Prime Minister\n\nViktor Zubkov -- a Putin ally -- was touted as being a possible contender for the post-Putin presidency, thus leaving \nthe prime minister's role vacant.  With Zubkov as president and Putin as prime minister, the political orientation of \nthe country was likely to continue on course.\n\nAt the same time,  Putin  could also decline to take on the job of prime minister and simply remain politically active \nbehind the scenes.\n\nIn other developments, Liberal Democratic Party candidate, Andrei Lugovoi, could well join parliament if the vote \ncount was sustained. A seat in parliament would immunize Lugovoi  from both prosecution and extradition in a \nnotorious spy poisoning case.  Indeed, Lugovoi had been named in the United Kingdom in connection with the \nmurder of former Russian operative Alexander Litvinenko, discussed above.\n\nPresidential Election of 2008\n\nIn anticipation of presidential elections to be held in 2008, attention turned  to possible presidential contenders.  The \nappointment of  Zubkov as prime minister in 2007 had fueled speculation about whether he would be Putin's choice \nof successor. But on Dec. 10, 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin nominated First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry \nMedvedev to be the presidential candidate in forthcoming elections, scheduled for March 2007.\n\n\n\nPutin noted that Medvedev had his \"full support.\"\n\nAs of 2008, Medvedev, backed by Putin, was hoping to slingshot far into the lead over the rest of the candidates.  \nHe had  the support of not only the president's party, United Russia, but also A Just Russia, Agrarian Party of \nRussia, and the Civilian Power party.  As before, there was speculation that he would appoint Putin as his prime \nminister if he was elected to the presidency.  Another strong candidate was Gennady Zyuganov -- a familiar face in \nthe presidential campaign in Russia, having run twice before.  He had served as  the leader of the Communist Party \nof the Russian Federation. Vladimir Zhirinovsky was also a candidate with experience in the Russian government, \nholding the position of the Nationalist Deputy Speaker of the State Duma.\n\nHe ran for the presidency three times, and was the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.\n\nThe full slate of  candidates in the presidential election, which was set to take place on March 2, 2008 were: \nVladimir Bukovsky, Alexader Donskoi, Viktor Geraschenko (Other Russia-Rodina), Sergei Gulyayev (Other Russia), \nGarry Kasparov (Other Russia-United Front), Mikhail Kasyanov (Popular Democratic Union), Gennadiy Seleznyov, \nOleg Shenin (Communist Party of the Soviet Union), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (Liberal Democratic Party), Gennady \nZyuganov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), Grigory Yavlinsky (Yabloko), Dmitry Medvedev (United \nRussia) and other candidates.\n\nIn pre-election polls taken in December 2007, Dmitry Medvedev had a very strong lead over any other candidate, \nwith 79 percent of the vote.  Gennady Zyuganov and Vladimir Zhirinovsky were at the bottom of the poll with 9 \npercent each.  If this trend stayed consistent, it was believed  that Medvedev would take the presidency, and Putin \nwould remain in power via the office of prime minister for at least another term.\n\nOn election day in March 2008, turnout was high at almost 60 percent.  Exit poll data showed that Putin's chosen \nsuccessor, Dmitry Medvedev, was on track to capture the presidency with 69.6 percent of the vote share.  Early \nelection results were in line with the exit poll data and indicated that he was carrying just short of 70  percent of the \nvotes  cast. Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, was headed for a distant second place finish, garnering close \nto 20 percent.\n\nWhile he noted that the election result was not official, Medvedev suggested that his presidency would follow the \npath set by his predecessor, outgoing President  Putin. To this end, Medvedev said his policies and programs \nwould be \"a direct continuation of that path which is being carried out by President Putin.\"  He suggested he would \nwork in tandem with Putin, who could move into the office of the prime minister.  As well, he noted that in the realm \nof  foreign policy, his core priority would be to defend Russian interests.\n\nLeadership in Russia in 2008\n\nOn May 7, 2008, Dmitry Medvedev was inaugurated into office and formally\n\nreplaced Vladimir Putin in the role of president and head of state.\n\nHis inauguration took place some months after his landslide election victory.\n\nA stalwart ally of Putin, Medvedev (like Putin) studied law at Leningrad State University in the 1980s and went on to \nbecome a law professor at that very institution.  In the 1990s, he moved into the realm of politics, working at the \nexternal affairs committee in the St. Petersburg government under Putin's leadership.  By the close of the 1990s, he \nbecame the deputy chief of the government's staff, and in 2000, he became the first deputy chief of the president's \noffice.\n\n\n\nHe was appointed as First Deputy Prime Minister in 2005, and was reappointed to that position in 2007.  Medvedev  \ncrafted his image into one of a working-class candidate who could relate to those around him.  On the issues, he \nwas concerned about the unemployment rate, and was hoping that the rate reductions would continue into his \npresidency.  Medvedev also expressed his intent to continue the policies set by Putin, particularly with regard \nto  Russia's economic growth and prosperity.\n\nPutin, who was constitutionally barred from a third consecutive  term as president after eight years in office, \nremained in the political spotlight.  A day after Medvedev's inauguration, Putin was approved by the lower house of \nparliament as the new prime minister and head of government.  Putin was approved by a decisive  392-56 margin \nand was backed by three of the four main factions within the Duma: United Russia, Just Russia and the Liberal \nDemocratic Party.  Only the Communists voted against him.  Striking a similar tone to Medvedev, Putin said his \ngovernment would concentrate on economic and social matters.  He also noted that he intended to cut Russia's \ninflation rate, lower taxation and create a favorable business environment.  But foremost on Putin's agenda was the \nformation of a new government.  To that end, he was expected to put forth a cabinet list.\n\nWith the new President Medvedev being only age 42 at the time of inauguration, and with Prime Minister Putin in \nhis early fifties, the two leaders of the Russian Federation embodied youthful leadership.  Together, it was expected \nthat they would continue to chart the policy course that had prevailed since the start of the Putin era.  \n\nSpecial Report:\n\nFrance negotiates truce agreement for Georgia and Russia as fighting dies down in separatist enclaves of South \nOssetia and Abkhazia\n\nOn August 8, 2008, the Georgian military launched an attack against separatist targets in South Ossetia.\n\nThe military offensive ensued only hours after the Georgian authorities and South Ossetia's separatists agreed to a \nRussian-brokered ceasefire.\n\nThe situation began when Georgian military troops and Russian-backed South Ossetian separatists were \nensconced in violent clashes over the course of several days.  Georgian tanks then attacked the separatist \nstronghold of  Tskhinvali, presumably in an effort to regain control of the region.\n\nAccording to Russian media, several people were reported to have been killed in the shelling.  As well, Georgian \nforces and South Ossetian separatists were reported to be exchanging heavy fire.  To that end, explosions and \nrocket fire were heard in the area around Tskhinvali.  The British newspaper, The Independent, reported that \"the \nassault is coming from all directions.\"\n\nFor its part, Georgia said that it was taking this action to stabilize the territory [South Ossetia].  Georgian Minister for \nIntegration, Temur Yakobashvili, said that his country was compelled to terminate South Ossetia's  \"criminal \nregime\" and to \"restore constitutional order\" to the breakaway region.\n\nGeorgian President Mikhail Saakashvili himself called for an end to bloodshed to end, but warned the South \nOssetian separatists that Tbilisi's patience was not limitless.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, South Ossetian rebel leader Eduard Kokoity said that Georgia was carrying out  \n\"a perfidious and base\" attack on Tskhinvali.  He also confirmed the assault on Tskhinvali saying,  \"The storming of \nTskhinvali has started.\"  Eyewitnesses on the ground said that the city was being attacked, the hospital was \ndestroyed and the university was on fire. The Red Cross reported that there were numerous casualties needing \nmedical attention.\n\nIn response, Russia was  said to be deploying troops to South Osseta to assist peacekeepers operating there.\n\n\n\nIndeed, an aide to the Russian Land Forces commander confirmed that Russian tanks and troops had entered \nSouth Ossetia and were approaching  Tskhinvali, which was reported to have been already devastated by the \nGeorgain offensive there.\n\nRussia's military presence in the region was not well-received by Georgia, given the fact that the Georgian \ngovernment has long accused Russia of arming South Ossetian separatists.  But Russia has its own counter-\nargument to levy against Georgia.  It has accused Georgia of deliberately ramping up its own military presence in \nbreakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and assuming a hard-line posture against these enclaves.  \nRussia's tensions with Georgia have been partially  rooted in another concern.  Specifically, Russia has been \nopposed to  pro-Western Georgia's ambitions to join NATO.  This geopolitical element has textured the larger \ncontext of the territorial struggle being played out in South Ossetia.\n\nIt should be noted that  Russia has enjoyed strong ties with South Ossetia, largely due to the fact that the ethnically-\nrelated province of North Ossetia is located within its borders, and both the south and the north have long hoped to \nunite. Indeed, many South Ossetians hold Russian citizenship.  As such, with vested interests on both sides of the \nborder, Russia called for an end to the ongoing violence.  Russia also urged the\n\ninternational community to  work cooperatively \"to avert massive bloodshed and new victims.\"\n\nHowever, the prospects for peace were not likely to be easily advanced, given the emerging situation in the region a \nday later.\n\nOn August 9, 2008,  Georgian authorities said that Russian jets had bombed military targets inside its territory \u2013 \nspecifically in  the Georgian town on Gori to the south of South Ossetia.  They also said that one attack ensued \nclose to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which is known to supply Caspian oil to the West.  Georgia described the \nair strikes as  \"a full-scale military invasion\"  and Georgian President Saakashvili claimed that Russia was at war \nwith his country.\n\nRussia had a very different perspective and placed the blame squarely on the Georgians.  Russian Foreign Minister \nSergei Lavrov indicated the dire nature of the situation by asserting that already  1,500 people had died in the \nconflict and more than 30,000 South Ossetian had fled into Russia to escape the threat of death.  The Russian \ngovernment said that it had to act to protect the South Ossetians, many of whom hold Russian citizenship. Russian \nPresident Dmitri Medvedev said that Georgia also bore a responsibility for \"protecting the [South Ossetian]  \npopulation\" and that his country's military action was intended  \"to force the Georgian side to peace.\"\n\nBy August 9, 2008, the  Russian army had advanced to take complete control South Ossetia's capital of Tskhinvali.  \nGeneral Vladimir Boldyrev, the head of the Russian ground forces said, \"Tactical groups have completely liberated \nTskhinvali from the Georgian military.\" Boldyrev also said that Russian forces would keep up the pressure on \nGeorgian military units. Russian  President Dmitry Medvedev explained his country's objectives in South Ossetia \nsaying,  \"Under these circumstances, Russia is guided by one task -- to immediately stop violence and defend \ncivilians and restore peace as soon as possible.\"  President Dmitry Medvedev also  demanded  the withdrawal of \nGeorgian troops from the conflict zone, saying that it was the only way to settle the \"tragic crisis.\"\n\nThat same day, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili called for an end to hostilities saying,  \"We propose an \nimmediate ceasefire and the beginning of the withdrawal of troops from the contact line.\"  On the home front, the \nGeorgia's parliament approved a presidential decree that essentially imposed  two weeks of martial law  in the \ncountry.\n\nA day later on August 10, 2008, Georgia said that it was withdrawing its troops from the South Ossetian capital of \nTskhinvali in the face of  Russia's counter-offensive.  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said his country's \ntroops were returning to the positions they held before the conflict erupted days earlier.  There was, however, some \nconfusion about whether Georgian troops were pulling out of Tskhinvali or withdrawing entirely from South Ossetia. \n\n\n\nGeorgian Reintegration Minister Temur Yakobashvili confirmed that the troops left Tskhinvali but were remaining in \nother areas of South Ossetia. Russian sources said that Georgian military units were still active in South Ossetia.\n\nPresumably due to the continued activity by Georgian military units in South Ossetia, and what Moscow described \nas  continued Georgian offensive action, Russian forces were continuing to carry out its own military action into \nGeorgian territory.  Reports from the region suggested that Russia carried out an air strike on a military airfield near \nthe Tbilisi International Airport.\n\nWith the situation grim despite the earlier declaration of a withdrawal of troops from Tskhinvali, Georgia said that it \nhad submitted a note to the Russian embassy in Tblisi calling for immediate negotiations with Russia regarding \"an \nend to all hostilities and a ceasefire.\"  Russia confirmed that the note had been received.  Russia at the time also \ndenied Georgia's claims that Russian air strikes had targeted populated areas.\n\nBut movement toward a resolution seemed no closer by August 11, 2008.  Georgian authorities said that Russian \nair strikes hit  communications facilities to the west of Tbilisi and the port city of Poti in the Black Sea. As well, \nRussian forces were reported to have led a raid through the other breakaway enclave of Abkhazia into the western \nGeorgian town of Senaki.  On the other side of the equation, Russia said that the Georgian military was still \ntargeting positions in Tskhinvali, despite claims of a withdrawal and overtures of a ceasefire.\n\nIn this way, both sides accused one another of continuing the hostilities and exacerbating the conflict.\n\nOn the international front, the United Nations Security Council had earlier convened an emergency session to \nconsider the rapidly deteriorating security crisis in the Caucasus.  Little was actually accomplished at that session.  \nLikewise, a spokesperson from NATO had already called on both sides -- Georgian and Russian -- to exercise \nrestraint.  However, with the violence ongoing, clearly restraint was not at hand.\n\nNevertheless,  the United States said that it was sending a delegation to the region to try to negotiate a resolution.  \nThe United States Department of States said that the envoys would  \"engage with the parties in the conflict.\"\n\nAs well, a European Union delegation was en route to the region and said that it was hoping to procure a ceasefire \nand withdrawal agreement from both Georgia and Russia.\n\nA separate Council of Europe delegation was also hoping to advance dialogue.\n\nIn the same time period, according to news reports, Russian President Medvedev reiterated the death toll -- in the \nthousands -- during a conversation with United States President George W. Bush. For his part, Bush, who was \nattending the Beijing Olympics, called for an end to the violence, warned of  escalation beyond the zone of conflict, \nand endorsed the notion of international mediation.\n\nIndeed, the international community's objective appeared to be focused on averting the prospects of a war in the \nrestive Caucasus, which has long been regarded as something of a powder keg.  Yet to be determined was the \nquestion of whether or not such efforts would actually yield positive results.\n\nDays later, Russia  noted that its military activity in the area was ending and Russian troops were seen retreating \nfrom the area.  The hostilities flared again when Georgia sent in troops to try to regain control of South Ossetia.  \nNevertheless, witnesses said that the full brunt of the fighting in South Ossetia appeared to be ending. Elsewhere in \nthe region, Russian troops were withdrawing from the other breakaway region of Abkhazia, however, separatist \nthere were reported to be ensconced in some continuing clashes with the Georgian military in the Kodori Gorge.\n\nYet even with an official truce in the offing (as discussed below) and an end to the fighting, the situation was not \npeaceful.  A war of words continued.  On an official day of mourning in his country, Russian President Dmitry \nMedvedev charged that Georgia had launched \"genocide of the South Ossetian people.\"  At issue were the deaths \nof thousands of South Ossetians, many of whom hold Russian passports, as well as the deaths and injuries to \nscores of Russian soldiers, including one general.  The Russian leader used the Russian word \"otmorozki,\" which \n\n\n\nroughly translates to \"thugs\" in English, to characterize Georgian troops.  Meanwhile, Georgian President \nSaakashvili  addressed a crowd of\n\nthousands  gathered in Tbilisi's main and accused Russia of  the \"ruthless, heartless destruction\" of  Georgians.  \nThe Georgian leader also warned that his country would no longer be a part of the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates (CIS) -- a group consisting of former Soviet republics.\n\nOn August 13, 2008,  French President Nicolas Sarkozy was leading diplomatic negotiations  to help Georgia and \nRussia resolve the crisis that had been sparked when Georgian military troops and Russian-backed South Ossetian \nseparatists were ensconced in violent clashes over the course of several days.  Georgian tanks then attacked the \nseparatist stronghold of  Tskhinvali, presumably in an effort to regain control of the region, and went onto gain \nmilitary supremacy over large swaths of Georgian territory.\n\nSarkozy put forth a peace agreement that both sides signed days later.  Central to the proposed plan for a truce \nwas that all forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions. Other elements of the plan included an end to the use of \nforce, an end to military action in perpetuity, as well as the free access of humanitarian aid.\n\nFrance, as the head of the European Union, has called on the European bloc to endorse the peace initiative ahead \nof its submission to the United Nations Security Council.  The European Union was also expected consider \ndeploying peacekeepers to the region to maintain peace and security, and also to protect the supply of \nhumanitarian aid.\n\nThe remaining thorny issue, which was not included in the framework of the truce, was the future status of South \nOssetia and Abkhazia. Neither Russian President Medvedev nor Georgian President Saakashvili  was likely to find \ncommon ground on that matter in the immediate future.  Indeed, the Georgian leader asserted, \"The territorial \nintegrity and belonging of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgia can never be put under doubt.\"\n\nOn August 17, 2008, Russia officially pledged to withdraw its forces from Georgian territory in keeping with the \nagreement.  At the time, however, its forces had control over large swaths of Georgian territory, including the main \neast-west highway through that country.  There was speculation that Russian troops might withdraw only as far as \nSouth Ossetia since Russia said it would only fully withdraw when Georgian police were ready to take over \nresponsibility for security.  NATO responded to anxieties that Russia would not abide by the withdrawal \nrequirements of the agreement by warning that relations would be compromised if Russian troops remained in \nGeorgia.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia was not occupying Georgia and would not annex \nSouth Ossetia. However, he also characterized NATO as biased and intent on saving the \"criminal regime\" of  \nTbilisi.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev told his French President Nicolas Sarkozy that the Russian \nwithdrawal  would be complete by August 22, 2008, although approximately 500 troops would be  installed as \npeacekeepers on both sides of South Ossetia's border.  Russian troops were soon identified exiting Gori -- the \nlargest town in Georgia located close to the border of South Ossetia.  Sarkozy, during talks with  Medvedev, \nacknowledged this withdrawal but noted that Russian troops were yet to exit Poti and Senaki.  Russia had earlier \nindicated that it would not soon leave the port city of Poti, and claimed that this would be in keeping with the terms \nof the ceasefire agreement.  Medvedev's government said that Russian peacekeepers were allowed to take \n\"additional security measures.\"  However, the United States and the United Kingdom countered this claim noting \nthat such buffer zones would violate the deal.\n\nIn other developments, the first United States ship with humanitarian aid was expected to dock in Georgia by the \nlast week of August 2008.  Two more ships were expected to arrive in Georgia as well.\n\nIn the last week of August 2008, Russia's Kremlin officially recognized the breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia \nand Abkhazia as independent states.  South Ossetians and Abkhazians celebrated the news of this recognition of \ntheir self-proclaimed sovereignty.  However, withoutwider  international recognition of sovereign status, and with \n\n\n\nmany countries of the West committed to the notion of Georgia's territorial integrity, the actual status of South \nossetia and Abkhazia remained in the zone of \"contested independent status.\"\n\nBy the start of September 2008, the European Union  (EU) had decided to suspend talks on a new partnership pact \nwith Russia, given  the still-incomplete withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia.  EU-Russian negotiations on the \npartnership agreement had been scheduled for mid-September 2008 but were based on a shared understanding \nthat Russian troops would withdraw to pre-conflict positions.  The lack of progress on that withdrawal front, followed \nby the EU's response,  signaled that relations between the EU and Russia were moving into highly challenging \nterritory.\n\nFollowing a meeting in the Belgian capital city of Brussels, EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said \nthat the bloc that he represented could not \"continue as if nothing had happened.\"  As well, the European bloc's \nforeign policy chief, Javier Solana, said that the EU could deploy civilian monitors to Georgia to determine whether \nof not Russia was complying with the ceasefire agreement that had been brokered earlier.  Meanwhile French \nPresident Sarkozy said,\"The EU would welcome a real partnership with Russia, which is in the interests of all, but \nyou have to be two to have a partnership.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation,  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that unchecked support by the EU and \nthe United States for the government of Georgian President Saakashvili would be a \"historic\" mistake.  He also \nintroduced the notion of an embargo on arms supplies to Georgia until a new regime was established there.  These \ndeclarations came in the background of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's assertion that his country's foreign \npolicy principles would not be dictated by the hegemony of any single country, such as the United States. \n\nIn October 2008, months after the Russian-Georgian conflict over South Ossetia, Russia removed a checkpoint \nnear the town of Gori.  The removal of the checkpoint  at Gori  -- located in Georgian territory close to the separatist \nregion of South Ossetia -- marked the first significant sign that Russia intended to comply with its withdrawal \npledge, which was part of the ceasefire deal negotiated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Indeed, Russia also \npledged to withdraw troops from  two buffer zones within Georgia -- now under European Union observation --  by \nOctober 10, 2008.\n\nAt the same time, Russia increased its troop presence in South Ossetia -- largely a result of an explosion that left \neight Russian soldiers and three civilians dead in the early part of the month.  Russia accused Georgia of \norchestrating the attack; Georgia denied the accusation. Russia also maintained its troop presence in the other \nseparatist region of Abkhazia.  Russia has recognized both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent while \nWestern countries have backed Georgian territorial integrity.  The matter of sovereignty has remained unresolved.\n\nEditor's  Note:\n\nAugust 2009 marked the one year anniversary of the war between Georgia and Russia over the breakaway republic \nof South Ossetia.\n\nOn August 13, 2009, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited Abkhazia, where he promised to build a military \nbase along the border with Georgia.  Putin also said that such a move would help guarantee the stability of \nAbkhazia and South Ossetia.  The Russian head of government said: \"Russia is going to deploy its armed forces in \nAbkhazia and take the necessary efforts to build a modern border guard system in cooperation with the relevant \nAbkhazian authorities.\" He continued, \"All these factors are serious guarantees of the security of Abkhazia and \nSouth Ossetia.\" Putin's pledge came on the first anniversary of the cease-fire, which ended Russia's war with \nGeorgia over South Ossetia.  As might be expected, Georgia decried the move, characterizing it as \"yet another \nprovocation,\" that could potentially \"escalate tensions\" in the region of the Caucasus.\n\nIn October 2009, a  report commissioned by the Council of the European Union  placed the blame for the start of \nthe 2008 war over the semi-autonomous region of South Ossetia on Georgia.  The report by the Independent \n\n\n\nInternational Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia found that the war, which erupted on August 7, 2008,  \nwas spurred when Georgian forces attacked the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, in an attempt to re-establish \nsovereign control. Still, the report did not cast Georgia as being the only guilty party.  It noted that the hostilities \nbetween the two sides led to provocative actions by both Georgia and Russia.  The report also acknowledged that \nafter Georgia shelled South Ossetia, Russia responded by not only repelling the assault but, in fact, pressing further \ninto Georgian territory.\n\nBoth Abkhazia and South Ossetia  declared independence from Georgia during a war in the 1990s, which  followed \non the heels of the collapse of the former Soviet Union.  Both Abkhazia and South Ossetia  are recognized by \nRussia as sovereign states, but have nonetheless remained  internationally-recognized as Georgian territories.\n\nThey have increasingly become flashpoints in the region.\n\nSee appendices of this Country Review on South Ossetia and Abkhazia for more details.\n\nOther Developments in 2008-2010\n\nOctober 2008 saw Russia test-fire  three intercontinental ballistic missiles.  One launch took place from the Barents \nSea, east of Norway; a second was launched from north of Japan; the originating location of the third was not \nspecified.  These developments came one day after Russia said that another  missile fired from a submarine had \ntraveled a record distance of 7,145 miles. President Dmitri Medvedev, who witnessed one of the missiles being test-\nfired from the north-western region of the country and who watched the missile being test-fired form the submarine \nfrom an aircraft carrier, noted that they were illustrative of Russia's defensive and military strength.  The show of \nmilitary might by the Kremlin appeared to be in reaction to the United States' plans to establish missile defense \ncenters in eastern Europe.  In a similar attempt to flex military muscle,  Russian ships were en route to Venezuela \nto participate in joint naval exercises with that country  in waters of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn November 2008, the issue of relations with the United States came to the fore following the election of Democrat, \nBarack Obama, as president in that country.  In a speech delivered to the Council on Foreign Relations in the \nUnited States capital of Washington D.C., Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed hopes that his country \nwould enjoy improved relations with the United States under an Obama administration\n\nRussian President Medvedev said that United States President-Elect Barack Obama had the potential to rebuild \n\"necessary mutual trust\" that had waned during the Bush years.  The Russian president also hinted at possible \ncompromise with the United States over the controversial plan for a United States missile shield in Europe.  He \nsaid, \"We have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global system or, as a minimum, to find \na solution on the existing programs, which would suit the Russian Federation.\"\n\nRelations with Georgia retured to the fore due to the chaos that marked the  fifth anniversary of that country's Rose \nRevolution, which swept President Mikhail Saakashvili to power.  As the Georgian president traveled in a \nmotorcade with Polish President Lech Kaczynski  close to the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, shots were \nfired.\n\nAlthough no one was hurt in the incident, both the  Georgian president and his Polish counterpart  accused Russian \ntroops of being behind the apparent attack in an area that has been the site of much cross-border violence.  \nAccording to Reuters, one individual in Saakashvili's entourage said that South Ossetians  fired warning shots when \ntheir motorcade came close to a checkpoint at the quasi-border area.  Meanwhile, President Saakashvili said that \nthe situation was a \"reminder\" that Russia was in  flagrant violation of the European Union-brokered ceasefire \nbetween Tblisi and Moscow.  President Saakashvili also railed against the Russians saying, \"Twenty-first Century \noccupiers, who have no legal, moral or other right to be there and oppress people, are stationed in the heart of \nGeorgia.\"\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the  equation, however, the Russian military as well as South Ossetian forces denied an \ninvolvement in the gunfire incident.  In an interview with RIA Novosti, a South Ossetian spokeswoman, Irina \nGagloyeva, asserted the following:  \"The South Ossetian side has nothing to do with it. There was no shelling from \nour side.\"\n\nA Russian spokesperson said to the Interfax news agency, \"The claims that Russian servicemen were implicated in \nthe shelling of the cortege do not correspond with reality.\"\n\nIn December 2008, the Russian Federation Council, which is the upper house of the parliament, approved the \nextension of the presidential term from four years to six years. The legislative body also passed the amendment of \nthe Constitution, which will increase the mandate of the deputies of  the State Duma, lower house of the parliament, \nfrom four years to five years. The draft legislation was pending because for it enter into force, it required approval of \ntwo-thirds of regional legislatures.  Given the ruling United Russia party's influence and popularity, it was  believed \nthat the constitutional amendments would successfully be formalized. These constitutional changes were put forth \nby President Dmitry Medvedev during his first state-of-the-nation address.\n\nIn early 2009, Russia and Ukraine were at odds over a gas deal.  At issue was Russia's refusal to implement an \nagreement with Ukraine to resume the flow of gas to Europe. \n\nRussian President Dmitri Medvedev  accused Ukraine of adding a declaration  to the text of the agreement that \ncontradict Russia's position.  The central issues in Ukraine's declaration relate to its gas debts to Russia and \naccusations that it has siphoned off gas intended for other European customers.  Meanwhile, there was no \nagreement about how much Ukraine should pay Russia for gas, or, how much Russia should pay Ukraine for \ntransporting gas to other European destinations.\n\nThe dispute has left several countries in the region without gas, and with Russian energy company Gazprom \nunwilling to restart gas supplies,  even as wintry conditions prevailed in the region.  As such, the European Union \nintervened in an energetic shuttle diplomacy  effort to resolve the matter. \n\nOn January 12, 2009, it was announced that Russia would resume gas supplies to other European countries via \nUkraine.  The announcement came as the EU was successfully able to broker an agreement between Russia and \nUkraine.  Central to the agreement were new provisions for (1) pricing for the purchase of Russian gas by Ukraine, \nand (2) the rate to be  charged by Ukraine for the transit of Russian gas. But by the third week of January 2009 \nbegan, the EU warned that the energy crisis would not be resolved unless the flow of gas actually resumed.\n\nIn April 2009, ahead of the G-20 summit in London,\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.  The two leaders agreed to \nrestart negotiations aimed at reducing nuclear warheads.\n\nNuclear politics took center stage when, ahead of a meeting with European Union leaders in the Czech Republic, \nUnited States President Barack Obama called for a world free of nuclear weaponry and cooperative action on \nglobal security.  President Obama said that his administration was committed to ultimately reducing the United \nStates' nuclear arsenal, noting that the very existence of thousands of nuclear weapons was \"the most dangerous \nlegacy of the Cold War.\" Acknowledging that a nuclear weapons-free world was unlikely to be realized in his \nlifetime, President Obama made clear that he intended to work toward that outcome.\n\nIn April 2009, Russian authorities announced that Moscow was ending its \"counter-terrorism operation\" against \nseparatist rebels in Chechnya.  The move would end military operations in the semi-autonomous republic with a \nmajority Muslim population after more than a decade.  It  would also set the foundation for \"normalizing the \n\n\n\nsituation,\" according to Russia's anti-terrorism committee.  Russian authorities said that after years of violent unrest, \nChechnya was not stabilized under the leadership of its pro-Kremlin leader, Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nFor his part, Kadyrov responded to Moscow's announcement saying, \"We received the news about cancelling the \ncounter-terrorism operation with great satisfaction.\"\n\nHe continued, \" Now the Chechen Republic... is a peaceful, developing territory, and cancelling the counter-\nterrorism operation will only promote economic growth in the republic.\"\n\nCritics of Kadyrov have said that stability in Chechnya has come at a grave price -- via fear of violence.  They \nalleged that he has used torture and death to intimidate his opponents. Human rights groups concurred that such \nallegations were not without merit.  For his part, Kadyrov has dismissed such charges as untrue. Meanwhile, \noccasional unrest prevailed in parts of Chechnya as well as the nearby regions of Dagestan and Ingushetia.\n\nIn June 2009, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, the leader of the southern Russian republic of Ingushetia, was critically \nwounded and hospitalized following  an assassination attempt. Yevkurov's brother was injured and three of his \nbodyguards reportedly died in the attack on  their convoy , which was traveling on a highway close to the city of \nNazran.  Reports on the ground indicated that a car bomb exploded just as Yevkurov's car drove by.\n\nThis attack was the third such incident in June 2009.  On June 10, 2009, the deputy chief supreme court justice of \nthe Russian republic was assassinated by gunmen.  Just days later, the formed deputy prime minister was shot to \ndeath.  Both attacks took place in Nazran.  Ingushetia -- like  neighboring Chechnya --  has been the site of violence \nin recent years.  While Chechnya, which was beset by a militant Islamic insurgency, has seen increased stability in \nthe last year, Ingushetia has absorbed a number of refugees from the Chechnya conflict.\n\nIn July 2009, prominent human rights activist, Natalia Estemirova, was abducted in the Chechen capital of Grozny \nand later shot to death. Her body was discovered in a woodland in neighboring Ingushetia.  Estemirova's apparent \nassassination was met by outrage in Russia and across the globe. She was the latest victim in a string of murders \nthat appeared to target activists and journalists trying to bring attention to the human rights situation in Chechnya \nwhere a long-standing conflict between Muslim separatists in the semi-autonomous republic and Russian \nauthorities intent on preserving territorial sovereignty. In recent times, that conflict has waned and, in fact, Russian \nauthorities announced earlier in the year that Moscow was ending its \"counter-terrorism operation\" against \nseparatist rebels in Chechnya. The abduction and murder of  Estemirova was therefore seen as a blight on the \nincreasingly stable political situation in Chechnya.\n\nIn reaction,the human rights agency, Memorial, as well as Russia's longest standing non-governmental \norganization, the Helsinki Group, both placed the blame for Estemirova's death on Chechnya's Kremlin-backed \nPresident Ramzan Kadyrov.  For his part, Kadyrov denied any involvement and vowed to investigate the killing. \nMeanwhile, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev also promised a full investigation as well as justice. But the \nRussian president went further in acknowledging that Estimrova was likely assassinated for political reasons. He \nsaid: \"It is obvious to me that this murder is linked to her professional work and this work is necessary for any \nnormal state.\" The Russian president then paid tribute to that work saying, \"She did something very useful. She \nspoke the truth, she gave a very open and sometimes very tough evaluation of what's happening in the country. \nAnd that is the value of human rights campaigners, even if they make those in power feel uncomfortable.\" In so \ndoing, President Medvedev broke new ground by rapidly, expressly and publicly condemning the assassination of a \nhuman rights activist with ties to Chechnya.\n\nAugust 2009 saw Construction Minister Ruslan Amerkhanov murdered in the volatile Russian republic of \nIngushetia.  Amerkhanov was reported to have been shot dead in his office.  It was the latest manifestation of \npolitical violence in the Muslim enclave. Only ten days prior, three employees of the Russian ministry charged with \n\n\n\ndealing with emergencies were themselves shot to death.  Moreover, several months earlier, Ingushetia's President \nYunus-Bek Yevkurov was critically injured in an attempted assassination.\n\nThen  days after the murder of Amerkhanov, a suicide bomber in an explosives-laden truck charged through the \ngates of the Nazran police station in Igushetia, killing more than 20 people and injuring at least 100 others.  The \nexplosives were detonated just as police officers were gathering in the morning courtyard.  It was the single most \nviolent  attack in restive Igishetia in years.\n\nNote that Ingushetia -- like  neighboring Chechnya --  has been the site of violence in recent years.  While \nChechnya, which was beset by a militant Islamic insurgency, has seen increased stability in the last year, \nIngushetia has absorbed a number of refugees from the Chechnya conflict.  In fact, during the second Chechen \nwar which began in 1999, Ingushetia was the destination for thousands of Chechen refugees. The United Nations \nrefugee agency has reported that  approximately  13,000 displaced people remain in Ingushetia today. Analysts \nhave said that in addition to the refugee crisis, the emerging wave of violence in Ingushetia has been spurred by \na  mixture of Islamic radicalism, frustration with the high level of poverty,  as well as outrage over corruption and the \nrepressive actions by the local security forces.\n\nProspects of a Russian loan to Venezuela to help finance the purchase of Russian arms were being discussed on \nSeptember 9, 2009.  Chief Russian foreign policy aide, Sergei Prikhodko, said that the Kremlin was considering \nsuch a loan to Venezuela.  The announcement came as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Moscow for \nmeetings with Russian  President Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nIn addition to the possibility of an arms deal, the meeting was intended to establish multiple areas for bilateral \ncooperation.  To that end, President Medvedev's Press Secretary Natalya Timakova said, \"There are plans for the \nconclusion of documents and agreements on oil and gas cooperation, on ecology in the oil and gas industry, and \nalso an agreement between the Justice Ministries.\"\n\nAfter his trip to Moscow, President Chavez confirmed in a weekly televised address that Russia had agreed to lend \nVenezuela over $2 billion for the purchase of weapons, such as 100 tanks and a series of anti-aircraft rocket \nsystems, and were intended to boost the country's defensive capacity.  President Chavez noted that  the anti-\naircraft rocket systems would make it difficult for Venezuela to be attacked.  He said, \"With these rockets, it is going \nto be very difficult for them to come and bomb us. If that happens, they should know that we will soon have these \nsystems installed, [and] for an enemy that appears on the horizon, there it goes.\" The move appeared to be in \nretaliation to a deal struck between Colombia and the United States to allow American troops access to Colombian \nmilitary bases. \n\nAlso in  September 2009, Iran put forth its package of proposals to the five  permanent United Nations Security \nCouncil members and Germany.  According to the independent United States-based entity, ProPublica, the five-\npage proposal, Iran called for  \"comprehensive, all-encompassing and constructive\" negotiations on a range of \nsecurity issues, including global nuclear disarmament.  However, the document detailing Iran's latest proposals on \nits nuclear ambitions conspicuously failed to mention Iran's own nuclear program.\n\nThe United States reacted by registering dissatisfaction with the proposal package.  Philip Crowley, the United \nStates Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, said that the proposed mesaures failed to address the status \nof Iran's nuclear program.  He said, \"Our concern is that the response itself did not really address what is the core \nissue of the international community and the core concern, which is Iran's nuclear ambitions.\" \n\nConversely, Russia reacted by suggesting that the Iranian proposals signaled positive progress. Russia's Foreign \nMinister Sergei Lavrov said, \"Based on a brief review of the Iranian papers my impression is there is something \nthere to use.\"  Lavrov also indicated that there would be no  oil sanctions against Iran. \"Some of the sanctions \nunder discussion, including oil and oil products, are not a mechanism to force Iran to co-operate, they are a step to \na full-blown blockade and I do not think they would be supported at the UN Security Council.\"\n\n\n\nThe American and Russian responses showed divergent approaches to the Iranian nuclear issue, and suggested \nthat consensus on the matter would  not be easily achieved.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Iran's nuclear program took on greater significance after the IAEA meeting, as \ndiscussed above.  If Russia was indicating that  it would not support strong oil sanctions against Iran, then what \noptions would be available to countries such as the United States, which has made clear that consequences were \nin the offing if Iran failed to resolve the international community's concerns about its nuclear ambitions?\n\nIndeed, neither the United States nor Israel have ever actually foreclosed the possibility of targeted air strikes \nagainst Iran, which would be specifically aimed at preventing that country from obtaning a nuclear weapon. But \nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin entered the fray, speaking against not only the imposition of new sanctions, \nbut also targeted military action against Iran. Prime Minister Putin characterized any attack on Iran as \"very \ndangerous\" and warned that it would lead to \"an explosion of terrorism.\"  That said, he also called on Iran to show \n\"restraint\" in its nuclear program and to be mindful of Israel's security concerns.  Prime Minister Putin said, \"This is \na dangerous region and Iran should show responsibility, especially by taking into account Israel's concerns.\"\n\nEarlier, the Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to have  made a secret visit to Moscow to \ndiscuss the matter of  Russian arms sales to Iran and Syria.  At issue has been rising tensions between Israel and \nRussia over Moscow's arms sales to Iran and Syria. Of particular concern have been the transfers of weapons to \nthe extremist Islamic organization, Hezbollah, in Lebanon -- a particular flashpoint even since the 2006 between \nIsrael and Lebanon-based Hezbollah. \n\nOn Dec. 4, 2009, an attack by Islamic militants on a Russian express train left 26 people dead.  The militants \ntargeted the luxury Nevsky Express that traverses  Moscow and St. Petersburg in what was one of the worst \nattacks in recent years.  A letter from the rebels claimed responsibility for the attack saying, \"This operation was \nprepared and carried out ... pursuant to the orders of the Emir of the Caucasus Emirate Doku Umarov.\"  It was a \nclear reference to the Umarov enclave, led by Russia's most sought after rebel leader of the same name who has \nled a jihadist insurgency aimed at removing the predominantly Islamic North Caucasus region from Russian rule.\n\nWhile attacks in the North Caucasus have taken place with some degree of frequency, attacks in major Russian \ncities have been fairly rare.  Now, Russia plunged into a state of anxiety as a result of promises from the terrorists \nto carry out  further \"acts of sabotage\" via its website.  Indeed, the rebels noted that they sought to sabotage \nstrategic economic targets across Russia saying, \"These acts of sabotage will continue for as long as those \noccupying the Caucasus do not stop their policy of killing ordinary Muslims.\"\n\nFor over a decade, Russia has been dealing with a violent Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus republics of \nDagestan and Ingushetia.  As well, it has fought two wars against Islamic separatists in Chechnya.  While  the \nsecurity situation in Chechnya has improved in recent years, the situation has not been nearly as positive in \nDagestan and Ingushetia where violent insurgent attacks have increased, leading President Dmitry Medvedev to \ncast the North Caucasus as Russia's biggest domestic problem.\n\nAs if to underscore this claim, only days after the railway bombing on Dec. 4, 2009, another bomb exploded under \na train traveling from Siberia to Azerbaijan in  Dagestan region. While that incident yielded no deaths, it was \ndeemed to be a \"similar act of terror\" by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.  According to Russian intelligence experts, \nthe use of follow-up attacks has been a hallmark of terrorists in the North Caucasus.\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2010, a raid by Russian security forces resulted in the killing of Madrid Begov -- a notorious terrorist in \nthe restive territory of Dagestan.  Russian authorities have said that Begov -- the leader of a subversive terrorist \nenclave, Shamkhal-Makhachkala -- had died after he refused to surrender to security forces.  Police have accused \nBegov of participating in a 2009 attack on a Dagestani security officer near the security service's headquarters in \nMakhachkala.\n\n\n\nFebruary 2010 saw explosions at a house in Russia's restive region of Ingushetia leave at least two people dead \nand 28 others injured.  One of the dead was a police officer while the other was a civilian.  Police were searching \nthe area  and investigating reports that an improvised explosive device had been planted in the house.  The incident \nwas attributed to the ongoing conflict between Islamist insurgents and militants against the pro-Moscow governing  \nauthorities. \n\nIn early March 2010, an Islamist rebel leader in Ingushetia was killed during a raid by Russian troops.  Seven other \nrebels also died in the incident, according to the Russia's Federal Security Service.  Alexander Tikhomirov, also \nknown as Said Buryatsky, was believed to have been responsible for the bombing of a train in November 2009 that \nleft 26 people dead.  While Tikhomirov had actually acknowledged his involvement in that attack, which was \nofficially claimed by \"Causasian Mujahadeen,\"  he did admit his involvement in the suicide attack on police \nheadquarters in Nazran in August 2009.  In that attack, 20 policemen were reported to have died.\n\nIn the early morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, female suicide bombers carried out attacks at two Moscow \nsubway stations, killing at least 40 people and injuring more than 80 others. The first blast struck the Lubyanka \nsubway station, followed by a blast at the Park Kultury station. The blasts appeared timed to maximize damage and \ncasualties. Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov said, \"It was a terrorist act carried out by ... female suicide bombers.\" To \nthat end, suspicion fell on the Chechen \"Black Widows\" who lost their husbands during the conflict with the Islamic \nseparatist republic in Chechnya. According to CNN, a group associated with Chechen separatists indeed claimed \nresponsibility for the attacks. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev promised that his country \"will fight terrorism \nwithout hesitation and to the end,\" while Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said those behind the attacks would \nbe punished. According to RIA Novosti, he said: \"It is well known that today a terrible crime against civilians in its \neffects and disgusting in its character was carried out. I am sure that police will do their best to find and punish the \ncriminals. The terrorists will be destroyed.\"\n\nDays after that attack, a teenage widow of a senior Caucasus militant was identified as one of the Moscow subway \nbombers. Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova was believed to be from the Khasavyurtsky region of Dagestan and was \nmarried to Islamist militant, Umalat Magomedov, who was killed by Russian security forces at the end of 2009. The \nsecond Moscow subway bomber was believed to have been the widow of another Chechen Islamic militant. Also in \nthe days after the subway attacks there were two more suicide bombings -- this time in Kizlyar, leaving 12 people \ndead, the vast majority of whom were police officers. As before, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev struck a hard \ntone as he spoke from Russia's restive North Caucasus region. He said, \"We must deal sharp dagger blows to the \nterrorists; destroy them and their lairs.\" He continued, \"The list of measures to fight terrorism must be widened. \nThey must not only be effective but tough, severe and preventative. We need to punish.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2010, a suicide bombing ensued in  Grozny, the capital of Russia's restive Chechnya region.  Three \npolice officers and two civilians were injured as a result.  The attack took place close to Grozny's theatre where a \nmusical performance was set to take place.\n\nWhile the Russian military has not been involved in offensive against militant extremist separatists in recent times, \nwith Russian authorities declaring success in the breakaway republic, clashes and incidences  of violence have \nnonetheless flared occasionally.  In addition to Chechnya, neighboring regions of Ingushetia and Dagestan have \nalso seen similar clashes and incidences of violence over the years.\n\nEarlier, on June 28, 2010,  ten individuals using aliases were arrested in the United States for allegedly spying for \nthe Russian government. According to the Justice Department of the United States, the ten individuals were \ncharged with conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government. Eight of the ten suspects were reported \nto have had \"long-term, deep-cover assignments\" in the United States. As well, nine of the ten suspects were \ncharged with conspiracy to launder money. Five of the suspects appeared in a New York federal court where they \nwere ordered to remain in jail pending hearings set for the end of July 2010. Other suspects soon faced court in \n\n\n\nVirginia. The arrests came after an investigation that went on for several years and, if convicted, the suspects could \nface five years in prison.\n\nAuthorities said they were in pursuit of an eleventh suspect.  That eleventh suspect was soon arrested in Cyprus \nand released on bail; he was subsequently reported to be missing after failing to present for a scheduled \"check in\" \nmeeting with the Cypriot police.  An arrest warrant was issued for that individual as a result but reports soon \nemerged that he may have fled that country. The Cypriot authorities were now under fire for mishandling the \nsituation; members of the opposition party in that Mediterranean country railed against the fact that an alleged spy \nwas allowed bail rather than being subject to a detention order.\n\nMeanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a trip to Eastern Europe, made clear that the U.S. \nwas committed to positive ties with Russia, the emerging spy scandal notwithstanding.  Secretary Clinton said, \n\"We're committed to building a new and positive relation with Russia.\" She continued, \"We're looking toward the \nfuture.\"  For its part, Russia has also indicated that the scenario would not affect closer bilateral relations with the \nUnited States.\n\nIndeed, only weeks ago, Russia backed the United States in advancing a plan for further international sanctions \nagainst Iran for its controversial nuclear program.  The United States-drafted proposal was passed in the United \nNations Security Council with Russian support, effectively imposing harsh sanctions against Iran.\n\nBy the first week of July 2010, plans were in the works for a Cold War era \"spy swap\" in which ten Russian agents \nwould be deported  in exchange for the return of United States agents being held in Russia.  Those agents sought \nby the United States included a Russian nuclear scientist, a former Russian military intelligence agent and a former \nKBG agent who were jailed for spying on behalf of the United States.  There was also a former military intelligence \nagent jailed for spying for the United Kingdom.\n\nThe exchange ensued in Austria with the ten Russian agents boarding a flight to Moscow, and the four agents \nreleased by the Kremlin  boarding an American aircraft close to the main passenger terminals at the airport in \nVienna. The entire exchange took a total of 90 minutes.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the two countries involved cast the spy swap in positive terms.  Russia said that the ten \npersons in United States custody facing charges there had been freed \"for humanitarian considerations.\"  Russia \nalso lauded the move as being illustrative of \"the general improvement of Russia-United States relations.\"  \nMeanwhile, the United States was dismissing claims that only four agents were released in exchange for the ten \nRussians.  United States authorities made clear that the four in question were \"high value\" and garnered far more \nusable information in comparison to the ten Russians.  Moreover, the White House in the United States was playing \nup the fact that knowledge of the spy ring and plans for the spy swap had been in the works for several months \nbefore the Russians were ever arrested. \n\nOn September 5, 2010, a suicide car bombing at a military base in  the restive Russian republic of Dagestan left \nthree soldiers dead and 32 others wounded.  The suicide bomber was driving an explosives laden vehicle and \ncharged through the gates of the base in the Dagestan city of Buinaksk.  Soldiers opened fire on the attacker before \nhe could get to the center of the base, but the attacker was able to strike a military truck, followed by the explosion.  \nThere was speculation that the actions of the soldiers likely decreased the carnage on the scene.  Magomedsalam \nMagomedov,the leader of Dagestan, said in an interview with Interfax: \"Today's terrorist attack indicates that \nmilitants in the republic still have the power to conduct such treacherous attacks.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev again reiterated his oft-expressed view that violent insurgencies in \nthe  North Caucasus have prevailed as Russia's most significant domestic challenge and a threat to national \nsecurity. The Russian leader has in the past offered the view that poverty alleviation in the region should be part of \n\n\n\nthe solution aimed at stabilization of the area. Indeed, expert analysts have likewise noted that poverty has been a \ndriving motivator behind the decision of many youth to join extremist Islamic militant groups in the North Caucasus.\n\nDays later on Sept. 9, 2010, another suicide bombing took place at a crowded marketplace in the North Caucasus \ncity of Vladikavkaz.  At least 17 people died as a result of that attack while close to 140 others were wounded. \nAccording to the independent Kavkazsky Uzel website, the bomber was identified as a resident of neighboring \nIngushetia.  Alleged accomplices of the bomber were apprehended, according to the federal security chief, \nAlexander Bortnikov. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said of this attack, \"The crimes like the one that was committed \nin the North Caucasus today are aimed at sowing enmity between our citizens. We mustn't allow this.\"  He \ncontinued by placing the blame for the violence on \"people without souls, without hearts.\" of them Putin said, \"They \nliterally hold nothing sacred. Our common duty is to fight these crimes, these criminals.\"\n\nWhile there were no official claims of responsibility for these bombings, they were the latest manifestations of \nalmost-daily violence in the North Caucasus region, usually by Islamic militants.  In Dagestan, clashes  between \nsecurity forces and insurgents likely linked with separatists in Chechnya have become regularized fare. Despite \nsuccessful offensive operations in the North Caucasus, violence by militants has been ongoing for some time, \neffectively plaguing areas in the region, such as Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan. Of note was the fact that \nwhile Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan have predominantly Muslim populations, thereby fueling the possibility \nthat attacks there contain a religious motivation, Vladikavkaz -- located in North Ossetia -- has been home to a \npredominantly Christian Orthodox population. In Vladikavkaz case, there was speculation that the motivation for \nthat attack resided with the prevailing tensions between ethnic Ossetians and ethnic Ingush.  But the North \nOssetian city of Beslan was the site of the horrific 2004 siege where Chechen militants took hundreds of hostages \nat a school, leading to the tragic deaths of more than 330 people, at least half of whom were children.\n\nOn September 16, 2010, Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev was arrested in Poland.  He was in that \nEuropean country to attend a two-day Chechen summit when he was detained.  Zakayev  was then subject to \nseveral hours of interrogation by Polish police, who were acting on the basis of an international arrest  warrant \nissued by Russia, which sought his extradition on terrorism, murder and kidnapping charges.  For his part, Zakayev \nhas denied being involved in terrorism, and indeed, could be considered something of a moderate since he has \ncalled for negotiations with Russia -- a position not embraced by most extremist Chechen separatists.  Since being \ngranted  asylum in the United Kingdom in the first part of the 2000s, Zakayev has been known to travel within \nEurope.  But in this case, he was arrested by Polish authorities who had no choice but to act on the decision by \nInterpol to place Zakayev on its most wanted list, at Russia's request.\n\nAttention was soon focused on the question of if Zakayev would actually be extradited to Russia to face charges.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that although the Chechen separatist leader had been arrested, there was \nno guarantee that Polish courts would rule in favor of extradition to Russia.  Meanwhile, the head of the \ninternational affairs committee of the Russian Duma or lower house of parliament, Konstantin Kosachev, applauded \nPoland for taking its  international obligations seriously.\n\nA day later on September 17, 2010, a Polish court ruled that Zakayev could be released pending its decision on the \nmatter of extradition.  But even if the Polish court eventually ruled in favor of extradition, according to Polish \nFinance Minister Jan Rostowski, the government of Poland still had the power to intervene on behalf of Zakayev.  \nRussia responded to events unfolding in Poland in  a less than favorable manner this time. Konstantin Kosachev \nwarned Poland that its failure to act in  accordance with international law would yield deleterious consequences.\n\nIn mid-October 2010, Islamic militants stormed the parliament in Chechnya, killing several people and injuring even \nmore. Two guards and an official were among the dead.  The militants shouted Islamic slogans, detonated a bomb \nand opened fire using guns as members of parliament arrived at the compound for work.  Many people, included \nmembers of parliament already inside the building, were able to avoid the bloodshed by running to upper floors.  \nThis was the latest episode of violence erupting in Chechnya, despite Moscow's official declaration ending counter-\n\n\n\nterrorism operations in the breakaway republic more than a year prior.  Since then,  Moscow has relied on the pro-\nMoscow efforts of Chechnyan leader,  Ramzan Kadyrov, to eradicate the remaining threat by Islamist separatist \nrebels.  However, recent times have seen an increase in insurgent violence not only in Chechnya but also other \nregions of the North Caucasus such as Ingushetia.  As well, only days after the attack on the Chechnyan \nparliament, explosives were discovered and defused close to a bus station in the  republic of Kabardino-Balkariya, \nwhile the director of a children's rehabilitation centre in Dagestan was shot to death.\n\nDespite successful offensive operations in the North Caucasus, violence by Islamist separatist militants has been \nongoing for some time, as discussed above, effectively plaguing areas in the region, such as Chechnya, Ingushetia \nand Dagestan.  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has often expressed the view that violent insurgencies in the  \nNorth Caucasus have prevailed as Russia's most significant domestic challenge and a threat to national security. \nThe Russian leader has in the past offered the view that poverty alleviation in the region should be part of the \nsolution aimed at stabilization of the area. Indeed, expert analysts have likewise noted that poverty has been a \ndriving motivator behind the decision of many youth to join extremist Islamic militant groups in the North Caucasus.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nU.S. and Russia forge agreement to cut stockpiles of  nuclear weapons as Obama and Medvedev set new tone for \nbilateral relations\n\nOn July 6, 2009, United States President Barack Obama met with his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry \nMedvedev, for talks on their countries' respective nuclear arsenals.  Following three hours of discussion,  the two \nworld leaders signed  an outline agreement aimed at reducing their countries' stockpiles of nuclear weapons.  The \n\"joint understanding\" was signed in a public ceremony in Moscow and would cut deployed nuclear warheads to \nunder 1,700 on both sides  within seven years of a forging new accord.  That new accord would stand in \nreplacement of the  1991 Start I treaty, which was set to expire at the close of 2009.\n\nA statement from the White House explained that the new treaty would \"include effective verification measures\" and \n\"enhance the security of both the US and Russia, as well as provide predictability and stability in strategic offensive \nforces.\"\n\nWhile the terms of the new concord would still leave both countries with enough weaponry to destroy one another, \nthe move was intended to stop the diplomatic \"drift\" away from cooperation on shared interests, which  had \noccurred in recent times.\n\nTo that end, President Obama said the United States and Russia were both \"committed to leaving behind the \nsuspicion and the rivalry of the past.\" He also noted that the new agreement was part of an initiative \"to reset U.S,-\nRussian relations so that we can co-operate more effectively in areas of common interest.\"\n\nFor his part, President Medvedev said that the talks had been \"very frank and very sincere\" and were\n\n\"without any doubt, the meeting we had been waiting for in Russia and the United States.\" The Russian leader went \non to state, \"I would like particularly to stress that our country would like to reach a level of cooperation with the \nUnited States that would really be worthy of the 21st Century, and which would ensure international peace and \nsecurity.\"\n\nIn addition to reduced levels of nuclear warheads and delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, \nthere were also provisions for submarine-launched missiles and bombers.\n\nIn a separate agreement, Russia said it would allow the United States military to  transport troops and weaponry \nacross its territory to Afghanistan, where  the  war against resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida was ongoing.  This use of \nRussian territory to move troops and equipment into the conflict zone would foreclose the use of  routes through \nPakistan, which have been  the target of  attacks by militants on a frequent and increasing basis.\n\n\n\nIn another development, Russia and the United States agreed to establish  a joint commission, which would \nfacilitate greater cooperation on energy, fighting terrorism and dealing with narcotics trafficking.\n\nIn a particularly significant move, the two countries agreed to resume military cooperation, which was suspended in \n2008 as a result of the  conflict between Russia and Georgia.\n\nYet unresoved was the prevailing source of controversy on both sides -- the  United States' plan to develop a \nmissile defence shield system in Eastern Europe.  This proposal has been strenuously resisted by Russia, which \neschews  greater American domination in its own backyard.\n\nIn a move aimed at gradually moving the two countries toward consensus on the issue, both Obama and Medvedev \nsaid that they backed a joint study on the threat of ballistic missiles and the institution of a data exchange center.\n\nPresident Obama, who characterized former President Vladimir Putin as having \"one foot in the old ways of doing \nbusiness and one foot in the new,\" met with the prime minister  of Russia on July 7, 2009.\n\nU.S. President Obama abandon's Bush era missile shield; Russia lauds move\n\nOn September 17, 2009, United States President Barack Obama  announced that his administration was \nabandoning the Bush-era missile defense shield program in Eastern Europe, which caused the grave consternation \nof Russia.  In its place, President Obama unveiled a \"phased, adaptive approach\" for missile defense on the \nEuropean continent.  At a news conference in the White House, President Obama said, \"This new approach will \nprovide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems and offer greater defenses against the threat of missile attack \nthan the 2007 European missile defense program.\"\n\nPresident Obama explained that he made the decision based on an assessment of Iran's missile threat and the \nPentagon's  \"phased and adaptive\" approach, which would ensure the American homeland defense. While \nPresident Obama acknowledged the threat posed by Iran, and although he insisted that he was committed to \n\"deploying strong missile defense systems which are adaptable to the threats of the 21st century,\" he also wanted \nto institute a plan that would be be appropriate and effective in responding to the current intelligence assessment of \nIran's missile programs.  To that end, recent intelligence appeared to indicate that Iran's capacity to attach \nwarheads to long-range missiles would not pose an immediate strategic threat to the United States and its allies. \nIndeed, Iran was more likely to pursue short-range and medium-range missile development.\n\nPresident Obama noted, \"The best way to responsibly advance our security and the security of our allies is to \ndeploy a missile defense system that best responds to the threats that we face and that utilizes technology that is \nboth proven and cost-effective.\"  He explained that the  new missile defense architecture would provide \"stronger, \nsmarter and swifter defenses. \"\n\nThe plan would essentially nullify former President George W. Bush's plan to deploy 10 missile interceptors in \nPoland and a radar system in the Czech Republic as part of its European missile shield, charged with preventing \nEuropean allies from missile threats by \"rogue states,\" such as Iran.  Bush's plan had been criticized by some as \nbeing impractical to implement.  Perhaps more significantly, Russia strongly opposed the missile defense shield \nconcept and argued that it posed a security threat to the region.  The matter caused a devolution in positive \nrelations between the United States and Russia at the time, with Russia warning of retaliatory moves.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Russia was now lauding the decision by the Obama administration to dispense with the \nBush missile defense shield system.  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed the shift as \"positive\" and \nmade clear that there were now \"good conditions\" for United States-Russia talks on dealing with missile \nproliferation. It was apparent that the \"reset button\" on bilateral relations between the two countries had, indeed, \nbeen pressed.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia quickly announced that it would now scrap its own controversial plans to deploy missiles close \nto Poland.  That proposal had been advanced in response to the Bush missile shield plan.\n\n\n\nBut now, as noted by Deputy Defense Minister Vladimir Popovkin during an radio interview in Moscow, \"Naturally, \nwe will cancel the measures that Russia planned to take in response to the deployment of U.S. missile defense \nsystems.\"  He continued,  \"Common sense has finally prevailed over ambitions.\"\n\nFor his part, President Obama said on an interview with CBS on September 20, 2009, that his decision was not \ndictated by Russian opposition.  He said, \"The Russians don't make determinations about what our defense posture \nis.\" He continued, \"If the by-product of it is that the Russians feel a little less paranoid... then that's a bonus.\" \nPresident Obama also noted that one of the bonus effects could be that the Russians might be more willing to work \nwith the United States in dealing with ballistic missiles from Iran or nuclear development in Iran.\n\nMissile defense talks to commence between Russia and the United States; geopolitics and arms control also on \nagenda\n\nUnited States officials were expected to be in Russia on Oct. 12, 2009, for missile defense negotiations with \nRussian counterparts. The Russian were led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov while Undersecretary of \nState for Arms Control and International Security, Ellen Tauscher, was to head the United States delegation. After \nthe groundwork has been established, further talks were set to take place later in the week between Russian \nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov and United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the negotiations, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the United States and Russia must \nadvance strategic arms reduction.  In an interview with Russia's Channel Once, President Medvedev said, \"While \ndealing with non-proliferation, we must simultaneously deal with the limitation and reduction of strategic offensive \npotentials -- both carriers and nuclear warheads.\" Medvedev continued, \"Today we have the chance to advance this \nprocess. We will be dealing with this. And I call on our American partners to do the same.\"\n\nWith the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty set to expire on Dec. 5, 2009, President Medvedev said he believed \nRussia and the United States could reach a new strategic arms reduction accord.\n\nHe observed, \"There is definitely a chance for the agreement, since the new U.S. administration has demonstrated \ninterest in this issue.\"  Medvedev also said he did not support the expansion of nuclear weapons states recognized \nby the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Striking a tone harmonious with his American counterpart, President \nBarack Obama, president Medvedev said, \"We are against the extension of the nuclear club. Otherwise the \nsituation will get out of control. The world without nuclear weapons is an ideal which should be on our agenda.\"\n\nPresident  Medvedev also reiterated his appreciation for President Obama's decision to scrap the Bush-era missile \ndefense shield plan, calling President Obama's new missile shield plans \"sensible.\"  He additionally noted that \nRussia was eager to extend missile defense cooperation with the United States and Europe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to Moscow to meet  with Russian \nPresident Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In addition to the issues related to missile \ndefense and a new successor treaty aimed at strategic arms reduction, the two diplomats were reported to have \ndiscussed approaches to dealing with geopolitical challenges in  Iran, the wider Middle East, and Afghanistan, as \nwell as possible joint work on climate change.\n\nIn an interview with the Newsweek's Russian edition, which was  published in the  German daily, Die Welt, and \ntranslated by Reuters,  Secretary Clinton said that her country and Russia found broad agreement on the issue of \nIran's controversial nuclear program.  While there was no specific promise from Moscow to impose harsh santions \non Iran if diplomacy failed, Secretary Clinton said, \"We have agreed to make diplomacy the priority with Iran. But if \nwe are not successful, we will consider other steps.\" She described her talks with Russian leaders as \"very \nconstructive\" and noted that the United States and Russia  were in \"full agreement\" on the path before them.  The \nUnited States' top diplomat also lauded Russia for not following through  with plans to deliver high-grade S300 air \ndefense missiles to Iran.  Secretary Clinton additionally addressed the Obama administration's plan to scap the \n\n\n\nBush-era missile defense system in Eastern Europe saying, \"On the question of the missile shield, we are very \nopen to cooperation with the Russians. We have made this clear to them. We believe that a joint missile defense \nwould make sense.\"\n\nOn Dec. 21, 2009, Russia and the United States were reported to have made good progress on negotiations on a \nnew strategic arms agreement. In an off-side meeting at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit, United States \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and expressed confidence that a new \ntreaty would soon be signed. At issue was the impending expiration of the existing Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty \nand the need to forge a new agreement.\n\nRussia and United States Sign New Arms Treaty\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2010, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged her Russian counterpart, Russian Foreign \nMinister Sergei Lavrov, to move forward with efforts to finalize a new arms reduction treaty.  During a briefing, State \nDepartment spokesman Philip Crowley said the United States' top diplomat \"emphasized to the foreign minister that \nour negotiators are close to reaching an agreement and encouraged Russia to continue to move ahead, push hard \nso we can reach an agreement in the next couple of weeks.\"  That timeline seemed to coincide with Russian \nexpectations, since a Russian lawmaker, Konstantin Kosachyov, noted that discussions were underway on a new \ntreaty to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which  expired on Dec. 5, 2009.\n\nIn March 2010, Secretary of State Clinton was in Moscow for meetings with Foreign Minister Lavrov. From Moscow, \nClinton and Lavrov noted that a new START would soon be finalized.\n\nAt a joint press conference with Lavrov, Clinton said, \"The results of the latest negotiation rounds lead us to believe \nwe'll be reaching a final agreement soon.\" At issue is a plan that would reduce the United States' stockpile of 2,000 \nstrategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's stockpile of close to 3,000, be reduced to between 1,500 and 1,675 \nwarheads respectively. There was, however, some dissonance on verification measures aimed at quantifying \nweapons and launch systems.\n\nMeanwhile, as progress was being made on a successor treaty to START, United States President Barack Obama \ncalled for  a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, as part of a changing national security strategy.  To this \nend, he said: \"The United States reaffirms our resolve to strengthen the non-proliferation regime to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century as we pursue our ultimate vision of a world without nuclear weapons.\" As President \nObama marked the  40th anniversary of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, he intimated new post-Cold War policy, \nsaying: \"Our forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review will move beyond outdated Cold War thinking and reduce the \nnumber and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, even as we maintain a safe, secure and \neffective nuclear deterrent.\"  President Obama also said he would work to  seek ratification on the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1996, but which had yet to be enforced.  \nThese statements appeared to reify President Obama's vision of a nuclear-free world, which was laid out in a \nkeynote speech in Prague in 2009.  It also came ahead of a nuclear security summit, set to take place  in \nWashington D.C. in April 2010.\n\nOn March 24, 2010, the United States and Russia announced they had arrived at a breakthrough agreement that \nwould pave the way for the establishment of a new START. Titled \"Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of \nStrategic Offensive Arms,\" the new agreement was a  milestone in the decades-long thrust to decrease the \nchances of nuclearized warfare.  Indeed, it could arguably be characterized  as one of the most important treaties \nforged in a generation.\n\nBoth President Obama and his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry Medvedev, were expected to sign the \nlandmark accord, which provides for the reduction of long-range nuclear weapons on both sides, and sets the path \nfor further  disarmament in the future. The accord was illustrative of the new texture of bilateral relations, marked by \n\n\n\nan increased level of cooperation and trust between the United States and Russia in the last two years.  \"Measures \nto Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\" was expected to be signed on April 8, 2010, in the \nCzech capital of Prague, symbolically marking President Barack Obama's call for a world without nuclear weapons \nin that very city a year earlier.  The timing would also ensure that both the United States and Russia would be able \nto enter the forthcoming  Summit on Nuclear Security with a joint claim of accomplishment.  They would also have \nthe moral high ground in their efforts to pressure Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nLauding the treaty as the most comprehensive weapons control accord in two decades, President Obama \ndeclared:  \"With this agreement, the United States and Russia - the two largest nuclear powers in the world - also \nsend a clear signal that we intend to lead.\"  He continued, \"By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons, and to ensure that \nother nations meet their own responsibilities.\"  Via his spokesperson, President Medvedev said the treaty \"reflects \nthe balance of interests of both nations.\"  As well, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the treaty \nmarked a \"new level of trust\" between the two countries.\n\nThat being said, on April 8, 2010, President Obama and President Medvedev held private talks at Prague Castle \nahead of the signing ceremony.  Later, both leaders signed their names on the new document that would \nsignificantly reduce the arsenal of nuclear weapons held by their respective countries. The two leaders of the \ncountries controlling 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons made it clear that membership in the global nuclear \nclub came with extraordinary responsibility, and a vision of non-proliferation.  President Obama said, \"This day \ndemonstrates the determination of the United States and Russia... to pursue responsible global leadership. \nTogether, we are keeping our commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which must be the \nfoundation of global non-proliferation.\"  Meanwhile, President Medvedev said: \"This is a win-win situation. No one \nstands to lose in this agreement. Both parties won ... the entire world community won.\"  In effect, the fact that the \ntwo countries  were able to find consensus on such a complex matter, and the two leaders were able to sign one of \nthe most important treaties in decades, signaled the anticipated \"re-setting\" of United States-Russian relations \nsought by the Obama administration in the United States when it came to power.\n\nThe difficult process of forging and signing  such a bilateral agreement would be followed by the equally challenging \nprocess of ratification in the United States Senate.  With an eye on this process, President Obama met in the Oval \nOffice with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the United States Senate, Senator John \nKerry (D-Massachusetts) and the ranking republican,  Senator Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) to discuss this \nimperative.  To the end, Senator Kerry said, \"A well-designed treaty will send an important message to the rest of \nthe world that America is prepared to lead efforts with key stakeholders to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons.\" It \nshould be noted that the new START would also have to be ratified by the Russian Duma.  Nevertheless, ahead of \na global security summit scheduled to take place in Washington, Russia and the United States would be able to \nclaim the high ground on leadership and responsibility among nuclear-armed nation states.\n\nLatest Developments --\n\nIn November 2010, President Obama was calling on the United States Senate to ratify the treaty.  He characterized \nthe need to do so as \"a national security imperative\"  on November 18, 2010, demanding that the upper chamber of \nCongress act affirmatively before departing at the close of  the year.  Bringing as much pressure to bear, President \nObama drew upon support from former secretaries of states and secretaries of defense from both political parties in \nthe United States -- Republican and Democratic -- to emphasize the urgency in ratifying the treaty.  President \nObama noted that  his country would not  \"afford to gamble\" with the matter.  He  emphasized that the United \nStates could not risk alienating Russia, whose support would be needed in pressuring Iran, given that country's \nsuspected program of nuclear proliferation.\n\nBut delay was on the mind of  some Republican senators who rejected the president's call for a review process \nduring the Senate's lame duck session of the outgoing Senate.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to this issue, President Obama said: \"Every month that goes by without a treaty means that we are not \nable to verify what's going on on the ground in Russia. And if we delay indefinitely, American leadership on \nnonproliferation and America's national security will be weakened.\"\n\nNote that despite heavy Republican opposition in the United States, the treaty was ratified in the United States \nSenate and then went through the ratification process at home in Russia.\n\nThe new arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia went into effect on Feb. 5, 2011, effectively \nreplacing the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his \nUnited States counterpart, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, exchanged ratification documents pertaining to \n\"Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\" or \"New START\"  at a conference in \nGermany.  Secretary of State Clinton said that the treaty was \"another example of the kind of clear-eyed co-\noperation that is in everyone's interests.\"  Foreign Minister Lavrov characterized the new treaty as \"a product of the \nunderstanding that unilateral approaches to security are counterproductive.\"  He continued,  \"The treaty that enters \ninto force today will enhance international stability.\"\n\nThe \"New START\" would  significantly reduce the arsenal of nuclear weapons held by the United States and \nRussia; it would limit the United States' stockpile of 2,000 strategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's stockpile of \nclose to 3,000, to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads respectively.  \"New START\"  was regarded as a  milestone in \nthe decades-long thrust to decrease the chances of nuclearized warfare.  Indeed, it could arguably be \ncharacterized  as one of the most important treaties forged in a generation\n\n2011 - 2012 Update:\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2011, a bomb attack at Moscow's Domodedovo airport left more than 35 people dead and at least 170 \nothers wounded -- many of them critically. Russian authorities said the explosion that took place in the international \narrivals hall of the airport, was carried out by a suicide bomber and appeared to be an act of terrorism. The location \nof the suicide bomb attack was not a restricted area of the airport; instead, it was open to non-passengers. \nEyewitnesses reported that the suicide bomber yelled, \"I'll kill you all!\" before presumably detonating the explosives \nstrapped to his body.\n\nThe Federal Investigative Committee said the bombing was aimed \"first and foremost\" at foreign citizens. Indeed, \namong the dead were citizens from the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, \nUzbekistan and Russia.  Perhaps not surprisingly, suspicion in this case quickly fell on North Caucasus Islamist \nextremists, with a record of terror attacks, as the likely culprits.\n\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev delayed his impending trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, increased security \nacross Moscow, convened an emergency meeting with officials, and said that a commission of inquiry would be \nactivated \"to conduct urgent on-the-spot investigations.\" The Russian president also warned that those behind the \nattack would be hunted down and punished to the full extent of the law. President Medvedev demanded that the \norganizations responsible for the attack be \"eliminated.\" To that end, three suspects were being pursued in \nconnection to the airport bombing. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was echoing the president's hard line, \nsaying that \"retribution is inevitable.\" He continued, \"This was an abominable crime in both its senselessness and \nits cruelty.\"\n\nAt the close of January 2011, Russian investigators said they had identified the Domodedovo Airport suicide \nbomber as a 20-year-old man from the North Caucasus. As well, at least two people were arrested on allegations \nthat they were involved in the bombing. As well, Russian authorities said that several other suspects in possession \nof pertinent information about the terror attack had been detained.\n\nBlame was also expanding to the authorities who may not have properly responded to threats of a potential act of \nterrorism at the airport. The news organization, RIA Novosti, reported that Russian authorities were warned in \n\n\n\nadvance that an \"act of terror\" was in the offing at one of Moscow's airports. President Medvedev attributed blame \nto airport officials for \"clear security breaches,\" and said that a shake-up was likely if the evidence pointed toward \ncriminal negligence by transport officials.  To that end, the federal Security Service later announced that several \nofficers had been fired.\n\nPresident Medvedev also seemed to hint toward major changes in Russia's security system, including the \nestablishment of Israeli-style airport security. He appeared to be referring to Israel's Ben Gurion airport, which is \ngenerally regarded as one of the safest in the world, and the wider airport security apparatus in Israel, which \ndepends on \"smart profiling,\" spot checks by armed guards, preliminary checkpoints, multiple rounds of surveying \nof luggage, intense vigilance, and other measures oriented toward to maximizing security.\n\nBy the second week of February 2011, a Chechen warlord, Doku Umarov, had claimed responsibility for the suicide \nbombing at the Moscow airport.  He also threatened further attacks, insinuating that the extremist Islamic \ninsurgency would intensify with more \"special operations\" in the future if Russia refused to allow theCaucasus to \nbecome an independent Islamic state. In a videotaped message, he warned, \"Among us there are hundreds of \nbrothers who are prepared to sacrifice themselves.\" Umarov, who has been seen more of a philosophical separatist \nleader rather than a military figure,  has claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks, including the double \nsuicide bombing of the Moscow subway system in 2010.\n\nThe threat emanating from the  Caucasus has long been Russia's most pressing internal challenge. Speaking of the \ndifficulty in keeping the Russian people safe from the threat of terrorism from extremist Islamic separatists, Dmitri \nPeskov, a government spokesperson said, \"The government is taking all necessary measures. But the nature of \nterror is that none of us, none of the countries in this world, are free from this threat. None of us could ensure 100 \npercent security level.\"  Vladimir Vasilyev, the head of parliament's security committee, issued a similar warning. In \nan interview with the media, he said,  \"All residents of our country need to realize that we will have to live under the \nthreat of terror for a long time to come.\"\n\nTerrorism in Russia was not a new phenomenon with militant Islamic North Caucasus terrorists behind a number of \nattacks over the years. In October 2010, militant extremists stormed the parliament in Chechnya. In March 2010, \nthe Moscow underground transit system was hit by two female suicide bombers from Dagestan. In November 2009, \nthe express train from Moscow to St. Petersburg was hit by North Caucasus Islamic terrorists. Years earlier in 2004, \nChechen terrorists carried out a brutal and bloody attack on a school in Beslan.  Even earlier, Chechen rebels \nfought two wars with the Russian military since the 1990s in the fight for Chechen independence.  But that effort \nseemed to have  yielded some success for Russian authorities who, with the help of Moscow-backed strongman, \nRamzan Kadyrov, claimed that the war in Chechnya was over.  Clearly, that success had been concentrated in \nChechnya with resistance spreading to other areas in the Caucasus region.  Abject poverty in the wider area of the \nCaucasus only served to create more fertile socio-political soil for extremism.\n\nReturning to Umarov's claim of responsibility, it was becoming increasingly clear that the ambitions of Islamist \nextremists had expanded from the goal of Chechnya's independence to a broader Jihadist ambition of creating an \nIslamic state across the Caucasus, governed by Shar'ia law.\n\nOn Feb. 27, 2012, Ukrainian authorities in the port city of Odessa said that they foiled an assassination plot against \nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.\n\nAccording to the Russian news agency, Ria Novosti, two suspects were shown on Russian television detained \nadmitting their involvement in an assassination plot that targeted Putin.  One suspect, Ilya Pyanzin, claimed that he \nhad been hired by Chechen militant leader, Doku Umarov, and tasked with killing Putin. A second suspect, Adam \nOsmayev, was identified as being on an international wanted list since 2007. It should be noted that a third suspect, \nRuslan Madayev, died in an explosion in Odessa that appeared to have sparked the discovery of the assassination \nconspiracy.  That conspiracy supposedly involved a plan to plant mines on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow, which \nhas been regularly traversed by Putin.  Details of the plan were reportedly discovered on laptops seized at the \nOdessa apartment where the aforementioned explosion occurred.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that if Umarov was, indeed, shown to be the central orchestrator of this plot, the motivation for \nthe attempted assassination could lie with the Chechen separatist movement.  That movement has long sought to \nimpose an Islamist state throughout the North Caucasus and has been embroiled in a bloody and lengthy fight with \nRussian security forces in the region.  As the principal architect of Russia's military campaign in Chechnya, it was \nconceivable that Putin might be at the top of the Chechen rebels' target list.\n\nPrimer on 2011 Parliamentary  and  2012 Presidential Elections in Russia\n\nParliamentary elections report  (Dec. 4, 2011) --\n\nA parliamentary election in Russia was scheduled to take place in December 2011. Russian President Dmitry \nMedvedev confirmed this timeline when he announced that the country's parliamentary elections would be held on \nDec. 4, 2011.  Although the Russian Federal Assembly, known as the Federalnoye Sobraniye, was a bicameral \nentity composed of the  Sovyet Federatsiyi (Federation Council) and the Gosudarstvennaya Duma (State Duma), in \nfact, only the 450 seats in the State Duma were up for election. Typically, members of the State Duma are elected \nby popular vote to serve four-year terms.  The last elections were held in December 2007; the United Russia Party \nof President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have dominated Russian politics, and won an \noverwhelming victory of 64 percent in those previous elections.  Clearly, United Russia hoped to continue its reign \non supremacy following the 2011 elections.\n\nAhead of the parliamentary contest, the head of Russia's only independent election monitoring group, Golos,  was \ndetained for several hours. Lilya Shibanova, who was held at Moscow's main airport after refusing to hand over her \nlaptop to authorities to be checked, said that the move constituted political pressure and intimidation.  While she \nwas subsequently released, her group. Golos, was fined for allegedly violating election law. The violation involved \nthe release of  \"election-related opinion polls and research\" in the days ahead of the election -- a time period when \nsuch  opinion survey research is not allowed to be published.\n\nThis scenario notwithstanding, the elections went forward as scheduled and Russians went to the polls to express \ntheir political voices. Indeed, President Medvedev  noted that Russia's political parties enjoyed \"free and equal \ncompetition\" in elections.\n\nHis pronouncement would prove to hold some merit as the outcome was not the one that the president might have \nideally preferred.  With the votes counted, it was clear that the composition of the  Duma would be somewhat \ndifference in the new parliament. Specifically, it would no longer be as heavily dominated by the United Russia \nParty of Putin and Medvedev.\n\nIndeed, United Russia appeared to have garnered just under a bare majority in the Duma (49.6 percent) in terms of \nthe popular vote, but 238 seats of the 450-seat lower chamber.  In this way, the ruling United Party of Russia would \nclaim victory, albeit with reduced support.  The new parliament would see representation by  the Communist Party \nwith 19.8 percent, and 92 seats as well as  the social-democratic Fair Russia with 12.8 percent and 64 seats,  and \nthe nationalist Liberal Democrats, with 11.42 percent and 56 seats.\n\nPrime Minister Putin parlayed the election results into populist political rhetoric, noting that the outcome  reflected \nthe \"real situation\" in the country.  Meanwhile,  President Medvedev said that the United Russia would have to close \nranks with other political parties on certain issues in the new Duma, in order to get some things done.  He said, \"We \nwill have to take into account the more complex configuration of the Duma and for some issues we will have to join \ncoalition bloc agreements.\"\n\nFollowing the outcome of the 2011 parliamentary elections that returned Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's United \nRussia party to power by a slim parliamentary majority, Russians took to the streets of Moscow in pro-government \nand anti-government rallies.  Anti-government demonstrators were claiming that the elections were flawed and \n\n\n\nsubject to both vote rigging and ballot box stuffing. Indeed, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets in \nMoscow on Dec. 10, 2011, to protest the election results.\n\nProtests were also reported in St. Petersburg, the southern Siberian city of Barnaul, Krasnoyarsk, Vladivostok, \nChita and Khabarovsk. The spirit of discontent was heightened when the Communist Party posted a notice on its \nwebsite stating that it did not recognize the results of the elections as valid. But supporters of the United Russia \nParty were also in the streets to rally support for Putin.  As well, Russian authorities deploying thousands of police \nand Interior Ministry troops for the purpose of \"ensuring the security of the citizens.\"\n\nAs the mass action continued, according to Amnesty International, more than 420 people were arrested in the \ndemonstrations  across Moscow and St. Petersburg, including several journalists and activists.  Amnesty \nInternational urged the release of  the detainees, which were referred to by the human rights group as \"prisoners of \nconscience.\" Russia's presidential Council for Human Rights also expressed concerns over the election results and \nthe detainment of protesters.  Even former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev entered the fray, calling for new \nelections, given the strong sense of irregularities that had taken hold in Russia.\n\nFor his part, on Dec. 11, 2011, Russian President Medvedev posted on his Facebook page that he had called for an \ninvestigation  into the alleged elections fraud; he also expressed disagreement with the protesters' slogans.  His \npost read as follows: \"Under the Constitution, Russian citizens have the freedom of speech and the freedom of \nassembly. People have a right to express their positions and that is what they did yesterday. It is good that \neverything was held within the law. I agree neither with the slogans, nor the statements made in the protests. \nNevertheless, I have ordered probes into all reports from polling stations regarding the compliance with the electoral \nlaws.\"  The Russian president was met by hostile Russian Facebook posters who expressed vituperative scorn for \nhis pledge.\n\nWith the Russian citizenry in a less than amiable mood as regards the governing leadership, President Medvedev \non Dec. 23, 2011, announced a series of political reforms that would relax restrictions on political parties and \npresidential candidates.  The proposals were ensconced  in draft bills that were sent to the State Duma for \napproval. According to the Kremlin, the proposal was intended to \"liberalize the requirements\" for the creation and \nactivities of political parties.\"  Certainly, the changes would make it easier for small political blocs to be registered \nwith the party membership threshold reduced from 50,000 to 500.\n\nThe comprehensive reform proposal was not expected to deter protesters from again taking to the streets to \nregister discontent over the entrenched political interests in Russia.  Certainly, it was clear that the protest \nmovement was alive and well in Russia on Dec. 24, 2011, when tens of thousands of people gathered in Moscow to \nonce again protest the outcome of the parliamentary elections held weeks earlier.\n\nPresidential Election (March 4, 2012) --\n\nSummary:\n\nRussians voted in a presidential election on March 4, 2012.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who previously served \nas president, was looking to return to the helm as president of Russia.  On election day, after the votes were cast, \nexit poll data  and preliminary results indicated that Putin was on track to win the presidency in the first round with \naround 60 percent of the vote share.\n\n***\n\nIn Detail:\n\nNote that a presidential election in Russia was expected to be held in 2012.  In September 2011, Russian Prime \nMinister Vladimir Putin,  who previously served as president, said he intended to contest that election with an eye \non returning to that post.  Current President Dmitry Medvedev indicated support for his mentor, Putin,  and that he \nwould consider taking on the role of prime minister himself. President Medvedev said that he was interested in \n\n\n\n\"engaging in the practical work of the government.\"  It was apparent that both Putin and Medvedev wanted to \nremain in the top posts of Russian government but did not want to contest elections against one another.  In mid-\nOctober 2011, the ruling United Russia Party confirmed that it would formally nominate Putin as its presidential \ncandidate for the presidential election  scheduled to be held on March 4, 2012.  On Nov. 27, 2011, as expected, the \nUnited Russia party officially nominated Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as its presidential candidate in the \nforthcoming election.\n\nFor his part, Putin made clear that since he intended to resume his post as president, he expected the current \npresident -- Medvedev -- to  hold the post of prime minister in the future.  Putin said, \"I would like to once again \nstress that if the voters trust us with forming the government, that they vote for the United Russia and me as the \nRussian president... Dmitry Anatolyevich (Medvedev) would undoubtedly head the government.\" Putin called for  a \nnational modernization plan to be implemented in Russia as part of an economic development strategy.  To that \nend, he noted, \"Russia should end its dependence on oil and gas and perform a transition to the innovative \ndevelopment model.\"\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2011, Russian billionaire  and leading industrialist in the precious metals sector Mikhail Prokhorov \nannounced  he would contest the presidential election to be held in 2012. Speaking at a news conference, \nProkhorov  said,  \"I made probably the most serious decision in my life. I will run for president.\" Prokhorov seemed \nrealistic about his prospects at the polls against Putin. Indeed, Prokhorov acknowledged that his bid for the \npresidency was unlikely to receive popular support  in 2012, but that he could potentially see inroads over the \ncourse of \"the next 10 or 15 years.\"\n\nAnother candidate was also known to be contesting the presidential election --  Sergei Mironov, leader of the \ncenter-left A Just Russia party.  Other candidates included Communist Party leader  Gennady Zyuganov and \nLiberal Democratic Party (LDPR) chief Vladimir Zhirinovsky.  However,\n\nYabloko leader  Grigory Yavlinsky was barred from contesting the election as some of the signatures collected in \nthe process of registration were deemed to be invalid.\n\nNote that in January 2012, polling data showed diminishing support for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's presidential \nbid.  The state-run polling agency, VTsIOM, said that Putin commanded about 48 percent in popular support -- far \nless than his landslide-levels of support in previous elections.  Still,  that 48 percent -- while diminished in \ncomparison to previous levels of support for Putin -- was nonetheless an improvement over VTsIOM's previous \npolling data, which showed  Putin with only 42 percent of voters' support. Another polling outfit, the independent \nLevada Center,  indicated  less optimistic election results for Putin.  Indeed, Levada Center forecast Putin to carry \nonly 42 percent of the vote -- not enough for victory in the first round of voting. Meanwhile, VTsIOM said that \nsupport for other candidates was holding fairly stable -- with 10 percent for Zyuganov, nine percent for Zhirinovsky, \nfive percent for  Mironov, three percent for Prokhorov, and two percent for Yavlinsky.\n\nBy February 2012, VTsIOM found momentum on the side of Putin, with 53.3 percent of respondents saying they \nsupport the prime minister who was seeking to return to the presidency.\n\nThe VTsIOM survey  showed Zyuganov was significantly behind with 10 percent of support,  while Zhirinovsky had \n8.2 percent, and Prokhorov had 4.6 percent of support.  Since  Putin would need at least 50 percent of the vote \nshare in the March  election to avoid a second-round runoff, this polling result at the start of February 2012 was \nencouraging for his ambitions.\n\nA week ahead of the Russian presidential election, polling data  indicated that Putin was enjoying momentum and \nwas on track to win Russia's presidential election in the first round. According to Levada Center's poll, Putin was \nexpected to receive about 63 percent of the vote share -- well over the 50 percent majority.  Following the trends of \nthe weeks before,  Zyuganov would come in significantly behind in second place with about 15 percent, while \nZhirinovsky continued to track with about eight percent.\n\n\n\nAlso in February 2012, tens of thousands of people participated in a number of political rallies in Moscow.  The \nrallies appeared to be roughly divided into two categories: pro-Putin events and anti-Putin demonstrations.  The \nanti-Putin contingent alleged fraud in the parliamentary elections held in December 2011 and urged voters to deny \nthe former president a return to power. Pro-Putin elements accused the opposition of fomenting discord and \nseeking a revolution that would ultimately result in Russia being too closely linked with  Western powers.  On Feb. \n17, 2012, a pro-Putin rally was organized by Federation of Trade Unions of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region \nand attracted tens of thousands of participants.  The organizers called on Russians to vote for Putin in the interests \nof the political stability of Russia.  As February 2012 was coming to a close, further such rallies were ongoing.  It \nshould be noted that Russian authorities made it clear that even after the presidential election was decided, it would \nnot try to stop protests or such mass action, which could well ensue.\n\nThe political landscape of Russia at the time in late February 2012 was also dominated by news of a foiled plot, \napparently by Chechen rebels, to assassinate Putin.  That news was likely to remind Russians of Putin's leading \nrole in the fight against Chechen Islamic militant separatists.  While human rights activists have criticized Putin for \norchestrating a harsh crackdown against the movement, many Russians have applauded him for his hard line \nactions in this regard, given Chechen militants' willingness to use terrorism to further their aims. Accordingly, Putin's \nnational security record could well be beneficial to him at the polls.\n\nAs March 2012 began, and as the Russian presidential election loomed only days away, the Russian Central \nElectoral Commission (CEC) rejected complaints submitted by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation \n(CPRF) and the League of Voters about the unbalanced provision of broadcast time by a number of channels to \npresidential candidates.  The CEC resolution determined that the complaints lacked objective foundation and \nconcluded that there was \"no evidence of equality violations of the candidates for the post of Russian president in \nthe placing of informational materials on Channel One, Rossiya 1, Centre TV or REN TV, or of any discrimination \nconcerning their access to airtime.\"\n\nThat case, along with the aforementioned political rallies, drew attention to the matter of a functioning opposition in \nRussia.  Was there an effective opposition force in Russia presenting a serious challenge to the traditional power \nbase in this country?  Does Russia embrace the notion of vigorous and open debate, common in mature \ndemocracies? Or does Russia's autocratic legacy prevail at the socio-cultural level?  Is Russia a venue for thriving \npolitical activism, or, it is a country that continues to adhere to a sense of order?\n\nWhile not a direct response to these questions,  the news agency, Interfax, released a survey on the matter of \nopposition forces and political mass action. The survey showed that the majority of Russians -- 55 percent -- believe \nthat political opposition should exist in the country.  The survey, which was conducted by Public Opinion \nFoundation, also found that most Russians believe that the country's authorities should be more responsive to the \nopposition.  That being said, 12 percent of respondents expressed a penchant for autocracy, saying that there was \nno need for an opposition.  About a quarter of respondents said that they did not believe a political opposition \nactually existed in Russia.  Close to 80 percent of those who replied to the survey questions said that they were not \ninterested in participating in protest action; only 13 percent responded positively to the idea of protest participation. \nThat all being said, an overwhelming 84 percent of respondents said that they did not believe Russia was in need of \nany kind of revolution at this time.\n\nPerhaps those last two data points would prove to be the most salient indicators of the outcome of the forthcoming \nRussian presidential election.  Stated differently, with the vast majority of Russians not enthused about either the \nnotion of radical change, or, participating in protest action, it was quite possible that they would vote in favor of the \nstatus quo.  The status quo would, more than likely, line up with Putin as president.\n\nHeading into the Russian presidential election, the main question would be whether or not Putin could win outright \nvictory in the first round.\n\nPolling data right before election day gave Putin a clear majority; it was yet to be seen if this would hold on March 4, \n2012. Note also that according to Russia's Central Elections Commission, almost 670 international monitors from \n\n\n\nvarious international, national, and regional agencies, were accredited to observe the Russian presidential election \nto be held on March 4, 2012.\n\nOn election day, turnout was reported to be high at 58 percent -- notably higher than the level of turnout in the 2008 \nelection.  After Russian voters had cast their ballots, exit poll data  and preliminary results indicated that  Putin had \nwon election, having secured around 60 percent of the vote share.  Other candidates were trailing significantly \nbehind, including Putin's toughest rival, Gennady Zyuganov.  Given the fact that he had crossed the 50 percent \nmajority threshold outright, Putin avoided having to contest a second round.\n\nIn an appearance with  current President Dmitry Medvedev, Putin claimed victory declaring, \"I promised you we \nwould win, and we won,\" he said. \"Glory to Russia!\"\n\nHe continued saying, \"We have won in an open and honest battle. We proved that no-one can force anything on \nus.\"  Outside the Kremlin, pro-Putin supporters gathered in the tens of thousands with flags and banners  with \nmessages such as \"We believe in Putin,\"  to celebrate the election victory for their standard bearer and his \nimminent return to the helm of the Russian presidency.\n\nNot all Russians were celebrating the election outcome, though, as opposition groups reported widespread fraud \nand charged that there were incidences of multiple voting by individual persons.\n\nIndeed, activists were outraged about the level of voting violations, while election observers were pointing to a \nphenomenon called \"carousel voting,\" whereby busloads of voters were driven around to different polling stations to \ncast ballots on a repeated basis.  Still, Putin's campaign chief, Stanislav Govorukhin, disputed these claims, instead \nasserting that this 2012 election was  \"the cleanest in Russian history.\"\n\nInternational monitors from the the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had its own assessment of \nthe Russian presidential contest. The  OSCE  said that although Putin's challengers were able to compete openly, \nthe election conditions favored Putin's election. In response, the British government called for Russia to consider \nthis finding seriously.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. \"A Russia with greater political freedoms, including the \nregistration of political parties, freedom of assembly and freedom of the media is in the interests of Russians and of \nthe wider world.\" Striking a similar chord, Human Rights Watch called on Putin to undertake key reforms once he \nbegins his new term as president.\n\nThere were reports that Moscow was under tight security after the election, and all expectations were that \nanticipated opposition protests would  ensue in the future.\n\nFor his part, opposition leader, Zyuganov, characterized the elections as \"unfair and unworthy,\" but encouraged \nRussians to take comfort from the knowledge that Putin \"would not be able to rule like he used to.\"\n\nZyuganov appeared to be referring to a hitherto reluctance of opposition-aligned Russians to take to the streets to \nregister their discontent.  As discussed above, though, mass action in Russia, while on the rise in recent times,  \nremains a relatively infrequent occurrence in this country, with many Russians seemingly ambivalent about it at a \nconstituent level.\n\nPost-Election Developments --\n\nIn May 2012, Vladimir Putin  was sworn into office as Russia's president.  The first week of May also saw outgoing \nPresident Dmitry Medvedev positioned to become Russia's prime minister.  The joint moves were a reversal of the \noutgoing hierarchy in the executive branch of government, which for years saw Putin serve as prime minister and \nMedvedev as president.  Those years were sometimes understood as Medvedev functioning as a place holder for \n\n\n\nPutin, who was constitutionally barred from serving more than consecutive terms as president, and who had already \nheld the presidency from 2000 to 2008.  The year 2012 heralded Putin's return to the helm of the Russian political \nscene as head of state.  That being said, Medvedev was not expected to quickly exit the executive branch of \ngovernment himself.\n\nIn fact, in April 2012 -- a month after the Russian presidential election -- Putin indicated he would announce his \nchoice of prime minister around the same time  of his inauguration. Under Russia's constitution, the candidacy of \nprime minister is proposed by the president but has to be approved by the State Duma.  Given the continued \nmajority of the ruling United Russia Party in parliament, Putin's choice was likely to be ratified.  To that end, all eyes \nwere on Medvedev as Putin's likely choice.  Putin's decision in the last week of the month to hand over leadership \nof the United Russia Party on to Medvedev augmented expectations that the outgoing head of state was set to \nmove in the position of head of government\n\nIn early May 2012, ahead of Putin's return to power as head of state, the country was rocked by virulent protests, \nleading ultimately to the arrests of hundreds of people demonstrating against the incoming president. Among those \narrested were anti-corruption activist, Alexey Navalny, leftist activist, Sergei Udaltsov, and former Deputy Prime \nMinister Boris Nemtsov.  Protesters hurled rocks, bottles, and flares at police, who responded using pepper spray \nand clubs to beat back the crowds. Several people were injured in the fracas while a journalist was killed when he \nfell from a  fire escape as he tried to film the unrest.\n\nOn May 7, 2012, as scheduled, Putin was sworn into office as president of Russia at a heavily-fortified ceremony at \nthe Kremlin States Palace.  In his inauguration speech, Putin said that it was his \"life's meaning\" to serve the \ncountry and its people.  He also augured democratic progress in Russia saying, \"We are entering a new stage of \nnational development. We want to live in a democratic country \u2026 in a successful Russia.\"  With the constitution of \nthe country having been amended to provide for longer presidential terms, Putin would now serve as head of state \nfor a six-year term.\n\nA day later on May 8, 2012, Russia's State Duma (the country's lower house of parliament), overwhelmingly \napproved  Medvedev's candidacy as prime minister in the new government.  Medvedev was supported by two of \nthe four Duma factions --  the United Russia Party and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia -- while members of \nparliament belonging to the Communists and A Just Russia lawmakers voted against him.  In a speech to the State \nDuma, Medvedev said his new government intended to  focus on economic and social issues, and that he would \nengage all political parties in dialogue.\n\nNote that at the close of May 2012, Medvedev was formally approved as the new leader of the United Russia \nParty.  The new party leader said that his objective was to ensure that in 2016, the United Russia Party  \"must be at \nthe top again and win a parliamentary majority.\"\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nNuclear Politics\n\nMarch 2012 was  marked by the Nuclear Security Summit in South Korea, and attendance of global leaders from \nRussia, China, and the United States.  The summit agenda aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism.\n\nAhead of the Nuclear Security Summit, United States President Barack Obama reiterated his call for  \"a world \nwithout nuclear weapons\" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the \nreduction of  nuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.\n\nIn a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United \nStates -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of \nnuclear arms.  The United States leader said his country had a\n\n\n\n\"moral obligation\" to pursue strategic arms cuts.  President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the \naudience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with \nnuclear threats.\n\n\"I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,\" Obama said. \"I say it as a commander in \nchief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my \ntwo young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.\"\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world, but he noted that \"serious sustained \nglobal effort\" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.\n\nThe issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns \nabout North Korea's nuclear arsenal as well as Iran's nuclear ambitions.  To that latter end, President Obama was \nexpected to meet with Russia's outgoing President Dmitry Medvedev on the matter of Iran's nuclear program -- an \nissue that has not always seen progress due to divisions among countries with veto power on the United Nations \nSecurity Council. With an eye on working cooperatively with such countries, President Obama pledged to work with \nRussia and China at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism.\n\nWith regard to China, President Obama noted that he has called on Beijing to work directly with Washington and \nthis offer \"remains open.\"  He further noted that the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul presented an opportunity for \nthe United States and China to fortify bilateral relations.  He said, \"I think this is also an opportunity to build on the \nexcellent cooperation and dialogue across all the dimensions of our relationship that we've been able to establish \nover the last three years\"  The United States leader observed that the  summit \"shows the progress that the \ninternational community has made in preventing nuclear proliferation and making sure that we've secured nuclear \nmaterials.\"  He continued,\n\n\"And I know that's in the interest of both the United States and China.\"\n\nWith regard to Russia,  the United States president said he hoped to follow up on the New Start Treaty (Strategic \nArms Reduction Treaty).\n\nThe \"New START\" provided for the significant reduction of the arsenal of nuclear weapons held by the United \nStates and Russia; it would limit the United States' stockpile of 2,000 strategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's \nstockpile of nearly 3,000 to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads respectively. \"New START\" was regarded as a \nmilestone in the decades-long thrust to decrease the chances of nuclearized warfare. Indeed, it could arguably be \ncharacterized as one of the most important treaties forged in a generation.\n\nPresident Obama expressed hope there could be a deal forged with Russia for further strategic arms cuts with \nRussia as part of the nuclear disarmament agenda. \"Going forward, we'll continue to seek discussions with Russia \non a step we have never taken before -- reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical \nweapons and warheads in reserve,\" President Obama said.\n\nThat being said, President Obama was overheard telling his Russian counterpart President Dmitry Medvedev that  \ndealing with the European missile defense shield would have to wait until after the election.  The White House \nexplained that President Obama was expressing the political reality of the campaign season  where rigorous \ndiplomacy and negotiations would be difficult to accommodate.\n\nPresident Obama addressed the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear development program, saying that time \nremained to resolve the deadlock through diplomacy.  \"But time is short,\" said President Obama. \"Iran must act \nwith the seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands,\" he continued.\n\nFor its part, Iran has insisted that it has the right to develop nuclear development for peaceful civilian purposes.  On \nthe other side of the equation, the West has asserted that Iran is seeking  to build nuclear weapons via its \nclandestine nuclear arms development program.  While Iran has been subject to sanctions as a result of its failure \nto fulfill its international obligations, international concurrence has not come easily due to objections from China and \n\n\n\nRussia.  However, President Obama made it clear that he intended to work with these two countries as he stated: \n\"Today, I'll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills its \nobligations.\"\n\nAddressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made it clear that the United States \nheld \"no hostile intent\" to that country, but warned that there would be \"no rewards for provocation.\"\n\nNote:  In addition to the controversial and difficult issues of nuclear development in Iran and North Korea, the \nsummit would also address the threats posed by nuclear terrorists, as well as radiological materials that could be \nused to construct a \"dirty bomb\" (i.e. a bomb that would spread radiological contamination rather than causing a \nnuclear explosion).  Also on the agenda was a plan for nuclear power stations to convert to low-enriched fuel.  Due \nto the complexity of  these issues, it was  unlikely that new agreements and concurrence would be found anytime \nsoon despite the participation of 50 countries at the Nuclear Security Summit.  Notably absent from the list of \nparticipants  at the summit were North Korea and Iran.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nRussian President Putin says missile deal more likely with Obama than Romney\n\nIn the first week of September 2012,  Russian President Vladimir Putin entered the fray of American presidential \npolitics, characterizing United States President Barack Obama as \"a very honest man\" while disparaging \nRepublican nominee Mitt Romney as being politically craven.\n\nIn an interview with state media, President Putin said that if President Obama was re-elected in the November 2012 \nelections in the United States, he believed it was possible for a compromise agreement to be forged over the \ndifficult issue of a United States' proposal for  missile defense system in Europe.  Russia has been opposed to the \nestablishment of such a missile system in its geopolitical neighborhood; however, President Putin was signaling that \na deal could be reached with an Obama administration in the United States that would satisfy the interests of both \ncountries. He said, \"Is it possible to find a solution to the problem, if current President Obama is re-elected for a \nsecond term? Theoretically, yes.\"  The Russian president went on to state the following: His desire to work out a \nsolution is quite sincere. I met him recently on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, where we \nhad a chance to talk. And though we talked mostly about Syria, I could still take stock of my counterpart. My feeling \nis that he is a very honest man, and that he sincerely wants to make many good changes.\"  He continued, \"But this \nisn't just about President Obama.\"\n\nThe Russian head of state pivoted to talk about President Obama's rival for the presidency saying that although he \ncould work with any American administration, there were limits to be considered.  He said, \"We'll work with \nwhichever president gets elected by the American people. But our effort will only be as efficient as our partners will \nwant it to be.\"  President Putin  then launched into as sharp rebuke of Mitt Romney's claim that  Russia was \n\"without question\" the United States'  \"Number one geopolitical foe.\"\n\nPutin said: \"As for Mr. Romney's position, we understand that this is to a certain extent motivated by the election \nrace. But I also think that he was obviously wrong, because such behavior on the international arena is the same as \nusing nationalism and segregation as tools of U.S. domestic policy. It has the same effect on the international arena \nwhen a politician, a person who aspires to lead a nation, especially a superpower like the U.S., proclaims someone \nto be an enemy.\"  Returning to the contentious matter of the missile shield, President Putin posed the following \nrhetorical question: \"But what happens if Mr. Romney, who believes us to be America's No. 1 foe, gets elected as \npresident of the United States? In that case, the system will definitely be directed against Russia.\"\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that President Putin's rare praise for President Obama stands in contrast to his attitude towards \nother American officials, or, American foreign policy in general.  Russia has blocked a number of United State-\nbacked Security Council resolutions against Syria at the United Nations, has at times stymied efforts to pressure \nIran on its nuclear development program, and has even accused the United States' Department of State of \nproviding tacit verbal support of anti-government demonstrations after Russia's recent  disputed parliamentary \nelections.\n\nUpdate:\n\nIn the second week of February 2013, a well-known  opposition activist Sergei Udaltsov was placed under house by \na Russian court, pending an investigation into the case against him.\n\nUdaltsov, the leader of the Left Front coalition, was charged with organizing \"mass disorder\" during a May 2012 \nprotest in Moscow.  For his part, Udaltsov has rejected the accusations against him, accusing Russian authorities of \ncarrying out a political vendetta against him.  But the Russian television channel, NTV, broadcast footage allegedly \nshows Udaltsov and others, including an official from the neighboring country of Georgia,  discussing a plan to \ndepose the Russian government.  For years, Georgia and Russia have had a fractious relationship.  Should  \nUdaltsov ultimately be convicted of the charges against him, he would face up to ten years in prison.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, Russian authorities announced they had foiled an attempted terror attack on Moscow following a \nraid on a home in the town of Orekhovo-Zuyevo to the east of the Russian capital.  The raid sparked a gunfight that \nended in the death of two suspects and the arrest of a third individual. All  three of the suspects were Russian \ncitizens\n\nwho were believed to have recently returned from  an Islamic  militant training camp along the Afghan-Pak border.  \nAccording to Russian security sources, the three Muslim suspects had been under surveillance for approximately \none month leading up to the raid.  They were allegedly planning to carry out an attack at a large  public gathering in \ncentral Moscow. With Russia's Independence Day occurring on  June 12 and attracting large crowds for \nindependence celebrations, there was speculation that this particular occasion may have been a possible target \ndate.\n\nFive days later on May 25, 2013, a female suicide bomber carried out an attack close to an interior ministry \ncompound in Makhachkala, the capital of the southern Caucasus semi-autonomous republic of Dagestan.  The \nsuicide bomber, a so-called \"black widow,\" whose spouse was believed to have been killed in the extremist Islamic \nseparatist campaign against Russia, was the only person to have died in the attack, while as many as 15 people, \nincluding five police officers, however, were injured.  Identified as\n\nMadina Aliyeva, she was actually married twice and both times to members of militant entities in the North \nCaucasus.\n\nWhereas Chechnya has long been viewed as the center of militant Islamic separatist violence in the North \nCaucasus against Russia, in recent years, it was Dagestan that had seen a steady stream of violence and \nbloodshed in recent times, related to the separatist agenda of Islamic extremists against Russian rule.  As if to \nillustrate that reality, on May 26, 2013 -- only a day after the \"black widow\" attack --  four people died and  and \nseveral others were  wounded in two car bomb explosions in Makhachkala.  The government of Dagestan said that \nit believed the incidences were all related.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nBoston terror bombings intersects with challenge of Islamic separatistm and extremism in Russia\n\n\n\nOn April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded along the path to the finish line of the Boston Marathon in the state of \nMassachusetts in the United States.  The explosive devices were believed to have been placed inside  backpacks \nand detonated remotely. Three people died  as a result of these apparent terrorist acts.  Meanwhile, there were \nmore than 130 people hospitalized due to the intensely grave nature of so many injuries. It should be noted that due \nto the placement of the  explosive devices,  many of the victims endured horrific injuries to their lower extremities, \nwith limbs severed as a result. Indeed, the scene of the tragedy displayed a traumatizing scene of dismembered \nand bloodied body parts along with the injured victims and shocked bystanders.\n\nThanks to the sheer quantity of photographic evidence from witnesses at the marathon taking pictures of the day's \nevents, as well as cameras installed on commercial buildings, authorities were able to get a sense of the \nperpetrators and their actions.  On April 18, 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released photographs \nof two suspects and actively sought the public's assistance in apprehending those responsible. \n\nLater on the  night of April 18, 2013 -- presumably agitated by the realization that their pictures were being shared \nwith the world -- the two suspects became engaged in a spate of violent activities with deadly consequences.  The \ntwo kiled a police officer on the campus of MIT University, carjacked a man in a Mercedes-Benz SUV, held him by \ngunpoint, identified themselves as the Boston marathon bombers,  and used his ATM card to withdraw $800 in cash \nfrom the car owner's bank account, before releasing him at a gas station in Cambridge.  The suspects then \nexchanged gunfire with police, with many stray bullets landing in the homes of people who lived in the hitherto quiet \nresidential neighborhood of Watertown.  As well, one transit officer was seriously wounded in the mayhem.  The \nsituation became even more intense when, during their attempted getaway, the two suspects hurled explosive \ndevices at the police.  Residents of the neighborhood who witnessed the events said in interviews with the media \nthat the devices looked like a combination of grenades and pressure cooker bombs.  Bomb detecting robots were \nsoon dispatched to  the scene to determine the security of the area since the two men reportedly hurled an arsenal \nof weapons and explosive devices on the Watertown residential street. Meanwhile, the firefight between the \nsuspects and police was ongoing. One suspect was shot in the exchange of gunfire with police and then was run \nover by a car as his accomplice made his escape.  The first suspect ultimately died as a result of his injuries, while \nthe second suspect was captured after Boston and its surrounded areas was placed under lockdown for several \nhours. The second suspect would later be charged in the United States  with using a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nIn the early hours of April 19, 2013, details regarding the identities of the two suspects were beginning to surface.\n\nThe suspect seen in the FBI photographs wearing the black cap,  and who had died as a result of the firefight with \npolice, was identified as 26-year old Tamarlan Tsarnaev.\n\nThe surviving suspect, who was seen in the FBI photographs wearing the white cap, was identified as his brother, \n19-year old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev.  The young men were of  Chechnyan and Avar (Dagestani) ethnicity.  The \nfather of the two brothers had worked in the  former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, which is now independent;  the  \nTsarnaev brothers spent some of their younger years there.  Anzor Tsarnaev was fired from his government job in \nBishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan) when the war sparked again in Chechnya in 1999; the general view was that he \nlost his job due to his Chechen ethnicity.  The Tsarnaev family then moved to the Russian semi-autonomous region \nof Dagestan, close to the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya, which has been the site of an extremist \nseparatist Islamic insurgency for about two decades. The entire family emigrated to the United States about ten \nyears ago and settled in the  suburban Boston area of Somerville and Cambridge.  Tamarlan Tsarnaev was a legal \nresident of the United States and Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev had become a United States citizen in 2012.\n\nInformation about Tamarlan Tsarnaev suggested that he had a difficult time adjusting culturally to life in the United \nStates, despite some success with a boxing career.  His decision to stop boxing on religious grounds appeared to \nhave angered and perplexed his father, who had been socialized in the Soviet system and culture to hold a far more \npermissive and moderate attitude towards Islam.  Influenced by his mother's religious transformation to Islamic \n\n\n\northodoxy, Tarmalan Tsarnaev reportedly became increasingly hard line in his Islamic and extremist views, even \nalienating some members of his extended family. Ruslan Tsarni,  an uncle to the Tsarnaev brothers, was on the \nrecord with the media saying that as far back as 2009,  Tamerlan Tsarnaev was becoming more of an extremist \nMuslim, expressing what he described as \"this radical crap.\" This trend appeared to have fueled a break in contact \namong family members.\n\nIt should be noted that the Russian government had Tamarlan Tsarnaev  on its radar, having requested that the \nUnited States authorities investigate him as early as 2011, due to suspicions of involvement with Islamic extremists \nand unspecified underground groups.  The FBI confirmed that they interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, as \nrequested, but found no cause for alarm at the time.\n\nTamarlan Tsarnaev certainly traveled out of the country for  extended periods of time, most recently in 2012 to visit \nhis father who was now living in the Dagestan region of Russia.  However,  the actual time Tamarlan Tsarnaev  \nspent  with his father in Dagestan was limited to one month, leaving the rest of the period a mystery and open for \ninterpretation.  It was  possible (although not confirmed) that he attended a terrorist training camp -- perhaps in the \nCaucasus region or elsewhere. But even without such an expedition, Tamarlan Tsarnaev may very well have been \nradicalized in a less \"official\" manner.  While politicians in the United States were eager to suggest that Tamarlan \nTsarnaev  was radicalized  out of the country, it was apparent that his increasingly extreme Islamic views were part \nof a personal transformation taking place in the home he shared with his mother.  Still, it was after an overseas trip \nmore recently that Tamarlan Tsarnaev created YouTube postings  called \"Terrorists,\"  which featured videos from a \nmilitant extremist in Dagestan  known as Amir Abu Dudzhan. In one posting, Dudzhan is shown holding a \nKalashnikov rifle and declaring: \"Jihad is the duty of every able-bodied Muslim.\"  It was apparent that Tamarlan \nTsarnaev  was  ideologically inspired by  Islamic extremism and radicalism, while being sympathetic to  the \nChechnyan and Dagestani separatist and Jihadist causes.\n\nOf course, the motivation for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev to join his brother in carrying out terrorist attacks remained \nmore of a matter for debate.  Significantly more well-adjusted to American life  than his brother, the younger \nTsarnaev was a seemingly successful student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, with a number of \nAmerican friends,  an active social life, and hopes for a medical career. It was difficult to determine if Dzhokhar \nTsarnaev shared his brother's Jihadist views, or, if he was simply motivated by his relationship with his brother.  To \nthat end, there were some suggestions that Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have  \"brainwashed\" his younger brother into \nparticipating in his terrorist agenda.  For his part, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's  posts on the Russian social media site, \nVkontakt, made it clear that he self-identified as Islamic in terms of religion and \"world view,\" and Chechnyan in \nterms of ethnicity and culture.  He also posted  links to Islamic and pro-Chechnyan independence websites.\n\nThere seemed to be bewilderment among United States intelligence circles about the idea that the Chechnyan \ndrive for independence and war with Russia should be transported to American terrain.  But it was not clear that \nChechnyan independence was the driver for the two Tsarnaev brothers to commit acts of terror.\n\nIn fact, it should be noted that Islamic militants  operating under the aegis of the  Caucasian Mujahedeenin denied \nany involvement in the Boston marathon terror attacks, emphasizing that their conflict was with Russia.  However, \nas discussed below, the militant Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus has steadily expanded past Chechnya's \nborders to neighboring territories, such as Dagestan and Ingushetia, and the cause itself has moved past \nestablishing  an independent Chechnya to a broader Jihadist goal in the Caucasus.  It was quite possible that \npersonal transformation to radical Islam meshed with the Jihadist agenda for the older Tsarnaev brother, and he \ndrew the younger one into the fold.\n\nBut it was also possible that these two young men -- neither of whom were victims of economic strife as is the case \nfor many Chechens, Dagestanis, and Ingushetians at home -- were motivated for different reasons. It was possible \n\n\n\nthat they were inspired by a broader ideological (read: global Islamic Jihadist) sensibility, reminiscent of the \nSeptember 11, 2001 hijackers, or the Nigerian Christmas Day bomber. All the young men in these cases were well-\neducated, spent several years in Western countries, quite possibly suffered from cultural alienation to some degree \nas a result of the experience, thus driving them to take on radicalized Islamic extremist identities, and ultimately -- to \nterrorist actions on the basis of religion.\n\nOn April 22, 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was reported to have told investigating authorities that he and his brother \nacted alone, rather than in concert with an organized Jihadist or terror enclave, and that their actions were \nmotivated by their Islamist beliefs, and inspired by the goal of global Jihadism. By the last week of April 2013, a \nclearer picture of the motivation for the bombings was emerging as reports surfaced about the radicalization of \nTarmalan Tsarnaev as early as 2010 -- a track that seemed to run parallel with the increasingly religious orientation \nof his mother. Both mother and son, as noted above, were wiretapped by Russian intelligence and appeared to \nhave discussed the possibility of participating in Jihad. As such, it was apparent that Islamic extremism within the \nTsarnaev family fueled the terrorist actions of the two brothers.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nRussian  president accused of repression as opposition leader is sentenced to five years in jail\n\nIn mid-July 2013, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was convicted of stealing and sentenced to five years \nin jail. At issue were accusations that Navalny orchestrated a scheme to steal approximately 16 million roubles \n($494,000) from a timber company when he was advising the governor of Kirov in 2009.  Judge Sergei Blinov \ndelivered the verdict saying,  \"The court, having examined the case, has established that Navalny organized a \ncrime and ... the theft of property on a particularly large scale.\"\n\nPolitical analysts had anticipated a suspended sentence; the particularly harsh five-year jail sentence was, \ntherefore,  being regarded with shock by political observers.  Supporters of Navalny gathered outside the court in \nKirov, to the northwest of Moscow, to register their outrage over the  conviction and jail sentence. Other mass \ngatherings attracted thousands of protesters in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. They railed in outrage against \nRussian authorities, screaming \"Shame!\" and \"Disgrace! Indeed, some critics were comparing the Navalny case to \npolitical \"show trials\" under Soviet leader, Josef Stalin.  To be sure, Navalny has the distinction of being the most \nprominent opposition leader to be prosecuted in Russia since the Soviet era.\n\nFor his part, Navalny gained notoriety in Russia as a vociferous anti-corruption campaigner  and as one of the \nleading voices behind anti-government protests.  He was also regarded as one of incumbent President Vladimir \nPutin's most formidable rivals.  Accordingly,  critics of the Russian president decried the legal case against Navalny, \nplacing the blame on the president for the conviction and jail sentence,  and further accusing Putin of political \noppression.\n\nAt the practical level, it was certainly true that a five-year jail sentence would ensure that Navalny was unable to \ncontest the next presidential election in 2018. Thus,  anti-Putin critics perceived the legal case against Navalny as a \ncampaign to sideline  one of Putin's toughest political rivals.\n\nNavalny was not one to shy away from criticisms of Putin, even referring to the Russian president as a \"toad\" and \naccusing him of using the country's  oil revenues to retain power.  With the knowledge that he would soon be \noutside the political purview, Navalny urged his supporters to keep up the opposition fight.  Via Twitter, he said: \n\"Okay, don't miss me. More important - don't be idle. The toad will not get off the oil pipeline on its own.\"\n\nThe international community was also weighing in on the situation with both the United States and the European \nUnion expressing concerns over Navalny's conviction  and noting that it raised questions about the rule of law and \n\n\n\nRussia's treatment of Putin's opponents. The White House called it part of a \"disturbing trend aimed at suppressing \ndissent.\"\n\nIrrespective of criticism from the West, or even pressure from Navalny at home, however, the fact of the matter was \nthat President Putin remained the most popular political figure on the Russian landscape.  Survey data by an \nindependent pollster, Levada, showed that Putin had a 63 percent job approval rating in mid-2013 -- certainly higher \nthan post heads of state in democratic countries across the world.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nNSA leaker finally escapes Russian airport purgatory and accepts asylum in new homeland of Russia\n\nMid-2013 was dominated by questions about the fate of Edward Snowden -- a former contract employee of the \nNational Security Agency  (NSA) -- who leaked classified information to the public and then fled the United States.  \nThe revelations about the United States' secret surveillance program highlighted the post-September 11, 2001, \ndebate over privacy rights versus national security interests in the United States.\n\nThe matter emerged in the public purview via an article in the United Kingdom-based Guardian newspaper.\n\nThe Guardian's piece focused on  a phone records monitoring program by the  National Security Agency (NSA), \nwhich gathers millions of phone records in the United States as part of a database for national security purposes.  \nThe phone records or so-called \"meta-data\" theoretically do not include the actual content of conversations.  \nInstead, the meta-data  concentrates on points of contact, frequency of contacts, location data, call duration, and \nother such patterns that could presumably assist in determining whether terror suspects are in communication with \npersons in the United States.\n\nThe United States soon took legal action against Snowden for absconding with sensitive intelligence documents \nand then  disclosing that classified information. Snowden was charged  with theft of government property, \nunauthorized communication of national defense information to  someone without a security clearance, and willful \ncommunication of classified intelligence. The latter two charges were violations covered under the Espionage Act.\n\nAfter fleeing the United States, Snowden headed to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, and from there he was in \nRussia en route to his final destination -- political asylum in another country.  With the United States making it \ndifficult for the NSA leaker to reach his final destination for asylum, Snowden was quite literally trapped  at the  \"in \ntransit\" area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport,  which was not technically Russian territory.\n\nUnited States authorities were demanding the NSA leaker's extradition to face justice for the crimes outlined \nabove.  But while Russian President  Vladimir  Putin  did not seem particularly enthused with Snowden's presence \nat the  Sheremetyevo Airport, he nonetheless quickly foreclosed the notion of honoring United States requests for \nSnowden to  be returned to the United States, saying the fugitive leaker had not broken  any Russian laws.\n\nMeanwhile, the motives behind  Snowden's leaking activities were receiving even greater scrutiny. Snowden \nexpanded his leaking agenda beyond the realm of exposing the NSA's surveillance activities to sharing information \nabout the clandestine infiltration of the Chinese computer network intelligence with the Chinese themselves.  \nAccordingly, it seemed that Snowden crossed the line into the realm of foreign espionage.\n\nSnowden offered a sense of his motivation for this line-crossing during a live online chat with the Guardian \nnewspaper on June 24, 2013.  Snowden declared: \"All spying is wrong.\"  Apparently, from the perspective and \npersonal judgment of Snowden, no covert activities by the United States targeting foreign governments were \nacceptable.\n\n\n\nLeft unconsidered for Snowden was the matter of whether or not his fellow Americans concurred with his stance, or, \nif Americans might appreciate the  utility of long-standing clandestine intelligence services in  the interests of \nkeeping the citizenry safe. Still, Snowden believed he was on a mission to expose this \"wrongdoing\" to the world.\n\nThe matter of how to go about accomplishing that goal was revealed in an interview with Snowden that was \npublished by the South China Morning Post on the morning he departed Hong Kong.  In that  South China Morning \nPost interview, the fugitive leaker admitted that he took the job as an NSA contract worker with Booz Allen Hamilton \nfor the specific purpose of acquiring and releasing sensitive classified intelligence.  Snowden was now on the \nrecord stating the following:  \"My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over \nthe world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago.\"  This admission was \nunlikely to strengthen his credibility, since it suggested that Snowden did not simply happen upon data he believed \nshould be shared with the citizenry. Instead, he actively sought employment  as a contractor to the NSA for the \nexpressed purpose of acquiring classified intelligence data, which he then illegally released not only to the public -- \nbut also to foreign powers.\n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama weighed in on the Snowden affair on June 27, 2013, when he dismissed the \nnotion of personally pressuring his Chinese and Russian counterparts regarding extradition.  Speaking from a news \nconference in Senegal (Africa) where he was on an overseas trip, the president said that he was concerned about \nthe documents Snowden might have in his possession.  \"That's part of the reason why we'd like to have Mr. \nSnowden in custody,\" Obama said. The president continued, said. \"But what I think we're going to continue to do is \nmake sure that we are following the various channels that are well established and the rules that are well \nestablished to get this thing done.\"  President Obama dismissed the notion of using tactics beyond the traditional \noutlets available, saying that he  was \"not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.\"\n\nSnowden appeared to draw closer to a future in Russia in July 2013, when the fugitive leaker applied  for political \nasylum in Russia. Snowden indicated that he would pursue temporary refuge in that country until he could be \nguaranteed \"safe passage\" to an unspecified Latin American country in the future.\n\nNoteworthy was the fact that around the same time, Russian President Putin pugnaciously asserted that Moscow \nhad \"no intention\" of handing over Snowden to the United States.  The Russian leader opened the door for \nSnowden to successfully find asylum in his country, pending one condition.  Putin said: \"If he [Snowden]  wants to \nstay here, there is one condition: He must stop his activities aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners, \nno matter how strange it may sound coming from my lips.\"\n\nFor his part, United States President Obama addressed the unfolding imbroglio with Russia over the Snowden affair \nas follows: \"We don't have an extradition treaty with Russia. On the other hand, Mr. Snowden, we understand, has \ntraveled there without a valid passport and legal papers.  And we are hopeful the Russian government makes \ndecisions based on the normal procedures regarding international travel and the normal interactions law \nenforcement have.\"\n\nIt should be noted that in a statement released via Wikileaks, Snowden had argued that the United States \ncondemned him to a life of \"the extra-legal penalty of exile\" as a punishment for his crimes.  He continued, \n\"Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.\"  Left \nunstated by Snowden was the fact that on June 21, 2013, the United States government levied legal charges of \ntheft of government property and two violations covered under the Espionage Act.  Clearly, in so doing, there was \nnothing \"extra-legal\" being undertaken by the United States government.  It should also be noted that the revocation \nof a passport is standard procedure for persons charged with crimes and deemed to be flight risks. According to \nfederal law,  an American citizen's passport can be revoked due to \"an outstanding federal warrant of arrest for a \nfelony\" as provided under Title 22 of the U.S. Code. Thus, despite Snowden's claim that he was now left a stateless \n\n\n\nperson due to the revocation of his passport, in truth, he remained a citizen of the United States, retaining all \nconstitutional rights as a United States citizen, while at the same time being subject to prosecution on United States \nsoil for his violations  of the law. Moreover, United States Attorney General Eric Holder expressly noted that \nSnowden would not  be facing draconian legal consequences, such as the death penalty, if he were extradited to \nface justice.\n\nSnowden made the announcement to seek asylum in Russia while meeting with human rights activists  and \npoliticians at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where he also condemned the West for preventing him from reaching \nhis ultimate destination in  Latin America.  This was in apparent reference to the fact that the Bolivian president's \naircraft was denied access to certain European countries' air space on suspicion that Snowden was aboard.  \nSnowden said, \"Some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a \nwillingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today... This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me \nto travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights.\"  In fact,  \nsovereign states  are fully within their rights to control access to their air space,  even if the outcome produces \ndiplomatic imbroglios.\n\nLeft unsaid by Snowden was whether or not he would be meeting the conditions of the Russian government that he \nrefrain from further harming the interests of the United States if he wanted to take refuge in Russia. It was not \nknown how Russia intended to respond to this request from Snowden, given an impending meeting between \nRussian President Vladimir Putin and United States President Barack Obama at a summit in Russia in September \n2013.  Obviously, by granting Snowden even temporary asylum in Russia, there would be a deleterious effect on \nrelations with the United States.  Indeed, the decision to allow Snowden to meet with human rights activists and \npolitical figures at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport was already raising the ire of the United States.\n\nAs noted by the White House itself,  the prospect of Russian asylum would violate Moscow's own stated position \nthat Snowden should avoid  further damage to American national security.  White House Press Secretary Jay \nCarney said: \"Providing a propaganda platform for Mr. Snowden runs counter to the Russian government's previous \ndeclarations of Russia's neutrality and that they have no control over his presence in the airport.  It's also \nincompatible with Russian assurances that they do not want Mr. Snowden to further damage U.S. interests.\"\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2013,  Edward Snowden was finally able to leave Russian airport purgatory and enter asylum in new \nhomeland of Russia. Snowden's Russian lawyer said that his client received the legal documents necessary to exit \nthe Sheremetyevo Airport's in-transit zone and enter Russian territory.\n\nAnatoly Kucherena declined to comment on the details of Snowden's Russian living arrangement, saying,  \"His \nlocation is not being made public for security reasons, since he is the most pursued man on the planet.\"  He did, \nhowever, disclose that Snowden would be staying in a private home of American expatriates. Kucherena also \nacknowledged that Snowden intended to \"build a new life in Russia\"  and  noted that the NSA fugitive leaker was \nlooking forward to learning about Russian culture.  Kucherena added that while Snowden's legal permit allowed him \ntemporary asylum for one year, the fugitive leaker did not foreclose the possibility of pursuing Russian citizenship in \nthe future.\n\nThe movement of Snowden into Russian territory, and with Snowden's activities indicating a clear pursuit of a life in \nhis new Russian homeland, marked a shift in Snowden's status.  Indeed, it reflected Russia's official decision to \nsupport the NSA leaker wanted by the United States government.  The move would invariably and deleteriously \naffect United States relations with Russia.\n\nYury Ushakov, foreign policy adviser to President Putin, tried to make light of the situation, saying the Snowden \naffair was \"rather insignificant\" and should not negatively impact relations with the United States.  However, the \nUnited States seemed to be taking  Russia's decision to grant asylum to  Snowden quite seriously. White House \nPress Secretary Jay Carney said: \"We're extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step \n\n\n\ndespite our very clear and lawful requests in public and in private to have Mr. Snowden expelled to the United \nStates to face the charges against him.\"\n\nWith United States President Barack Obama due to travel to Russia to attend the G-20 summit, the fact of the \nmatter was that the Snowden affair could potentially cause  the United States leader to cancel his  planned private \nmeeting with Putin, his Russian counterpart.  As noted by  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, \"We're \nevaluating the utility of a summit in light of this and other issues.\"  Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer was more \nforthright in his assessment of the situation.  He said Russia's decision to grant Snowden asylum was a \"stab in the \nback\" and recommended that President Obama consider relocating the G-20 summit  to a country other than \nRussia.\n\nNot surprisingly, in the first week of August 2013, President Obama cancelled his meeting with President  Putin, \nalthough the United States president did intend to travel to Russia to attend the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg. A \nstatement from the White House read as follows: \"We have reached the conclusion that there is not enough recent \nprogress in our bilateral agenda with Russia to hold a U.S.-Russia Summit.\" The White House statement continued, \n\"We believe it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared \nagenda.\"\n\nThe Russian Kremlin expressed disappointment over President Obama's decision.  As before, Putin's foreign policy \nadviser, Ushakov, tried to downplay the situation  and move toward more productive ground, saying,  \"Russian \nrepresentatives are ready to continue working together with American partners on all key issues on the bilateral and \nmultilateral agenda.\" But at home in the United States, it seemed that White House national security advisers had \nunanimously backed the decision to cancel the meeting with Putin.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nSyrian Crisis and U.S.-Russian deal:\n\nReport of chemical weapons usage surfaces and exacerbates Syrian Crisis; has the \"red line\" been crossed and \nwill international powers now involve themselves in the Syrian civil war?\n\nSummary:\n\nSince early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an \naddition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in March 2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding \nthe resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end \ncorruption. For his part, President Assad announced he would advance a reform agenda, which would include lifting \nthe emergency laws that had been in place for decades, and increased rights to the country's disenfranchised \nKurdish population. These moves were aimed at quelling the rising climate of unrest gripping the country. But over \ntime, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hard line crackdown on dissent, tensions \nescalated between the government and the protesters.\n\nIn mid-2011, the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League respectively issued condemnations of the \nviolence in Syria. As well, the United Nations Human Rights Council called for an independent inquiry into the \nviolent crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile, global leaders were calling for President Assad to step down from power, \ngiven the brutality of the Syrian regime's crackdown on protesters. As of 2012, the bloody crackdown by the Assad \nregime on anti-government protesters was ongoing. In fact, the crackdown appeared to become more relentless in \nplaces such as Homs and Aleppo. Despite widespread condemnation from the West, a United Nations Security \nResolution on the situation in Syria was subject to veto by Russia and China. A subsequent vote in the United \nNations General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Syria for its brutal crackdown. A prevailing truce, brokered \n\n\n\nby the joint United Nations/Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, was established in the interests of preventing further \nbloodshed; however, it was revealed to be an exercise in theory rather than practice and eventually the United \nNations monitoring mission ended in failure.\n\nSyria has, meanwhile, been subject to sanctions by various countries and was sliding into pariah status in the \ninternational community. Assassinations, alleged  massacres, geopolitical tensions with Turkey and Israel,  and \nmost recently, suspicions about the use of chemical weapons, have since mired the Syrian landscape.  Indeed, it \nwas increasingly clear that Syria had slipped into a state of civil war and was facing a devastating humanitarian \ncrisis.  That crisis reached new heights in August 2013 with claims that Syrian forces launched a chemical attack on \nthe outskirts of Damascus.  Was this the clear sign that United States President Barack Obama's \"red line\" had \ndefinitively been crossed? And would the international community become more involved in the Syrian crisis?  The \nanswers to those questions were yet to be determined.\n\nChemical weapons issue resurfaces:\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, Syrian opposition activists and rebels said that chemical weapons had killed hundreds of people \non the outskirts of Damascus. They said that government forces launched a major bombardment on rebel forces in \nthe area of Ghouta using rockets with toxic agents.  The Syrian government dismissed the accusations as  \"illogical \nand fabricated.\"  The Syrian military further said that rebel forces were suffering major defeat and were using claims \nof chemical attacks to draw attention away from the fact that they were losing the war.\n\nThe claims and counter-claims set up rival theories that could not be verified simply by looking at the videotaped \nfootage of victims that immediately surfaced online.  Stated differently, while the international media was able to \nobtain visual evidence of victims who had died, that footage could not prove whether they died as a result of \nconventional military bombardment or due to exposure to toxic substances.  However, there was an increasing \nchorus of disturbing assertions by medical staff that the victims, particularly children, appeared to have suffered \nsuffocation and blurred vision.  As well, further videotaped footage was starting to surface about the purported \nattacks, this time showing  victims enduring convulsions or distinctly encountering breathing problems.  In an \ninterview with BBC News, Professor Alexander Kekule of the Institute for Medical Microbiology at Halle University in \nGermany, admitted that the videotaped images of the victims certainly suggested they had been subject to  a \nchemical agent of some kind.  However, he made a point of noting that none of the victims showed signs that they \nhad been exposed to  chemicals such as  sarin or organophosphorous nerve agents.\n\nThe international community seemed initially wary to accept the claims of chemical attacks, perhaps with the \nmemory of the inconclusive chemical weapons claims so fresh in their minds from earlier in the year (2013).  Only \nrecently, United Nations investigators traveled to Syria to look into those earlier claims.  In August 2013, the United \nNations convened an emergency meeting to discuss the newest chemical attack claims and its immediate response \nwas to seek clarification on the situation in Syria.  As noted by  Maria Cristina Perceval, Argentina's United Nations \nAmbassador, \"There is a strong concern among council members about the allegations and a general sense that \nthere must be clarity on what happened and the situation must be followed closely.\"\n\nThat being said, individual countries -- such as France  and the United Kingdom-- were going further and \ndemanding that United Nations inspectors who were already investigating the earlier allegations of  chemical \nattacks in Syria now look into these fresh claims.  The United States echoed their call via White House \nspokesperson Josh Earnest, who said: \"The United States is deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of Syrian \ncivilians have been killed in an attack by Syrian government forces, including by the use of chemical weapons, near \nDamascus earlier today. We are formally requesting that the United Nations urgently investigate this new allegation. \nThe United Nations investigative team, which is currently in Syria, is prepared to do so, and that is consistent with \nits purpose and mandate.\"  Both the European Union and the Arab League entered the fray, adding their own \nvoices to the call for United Nations inspectors to go look into the matter.\n\n\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Russia had a different view and noted that the timing of the fresh claims of chemical \nattacks came just as United Nations inspectors were in Syria to investigate the chemical claims from earlier in 2013  \nThe Russian foreign ministry said, \"This makes us think that we are once again dealing with a premeditated \nprovocation.\"  Indeed, there was a legitimate question as to why the Syrian government would choose to use \nchemical weapons at a time when United Nations inspectors were \"in country\" and especially given United States \nPresident Barack Obama's 2012 famous statement that his country would not be involving itself in the Syrian crisis \nunless the Assad regime used chemical weapons -- essentially crossing a vital \"red line\" -- that could augur \ninternational military action.\n\nThere was incremental movement in that direction  on Aug. 22, 2013, when  the United Kingdom, France, and \nTurkey all demanded that the  international community take a strong stand against the Syrian regime, if the \nchemical weapons attack was verified.\n\nFrance went further with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius saying that if  the claims of a chemical attack \nproved to be true, a \"reaction of force\" would result. The United Kingdom issued a similar threat via the British \nForeign Office, noting,  \"We believe a political solution is the best way to end the bloodshed\"  but also warning  that \nthe government of Prime Minister David Cameron \"has said many times we cannot rule out any option that might \nsave innocent lives in Syria.\"  Meanwhile, Turkey goaded the United Nations about its symbolic \"foot dragging\" as \nTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu declared: \"All red lines have been crossed but still the United Nations \nSecurity Council has not even been able to take a decision.\"\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2013, United States President Barack Obama offered comments on the alleged use of chemical \nweapons in Syria saying that the claims constituted a \"big event, of grave concern.\"  In an interview  with  CNN, \nPresident Obama noted that the conflict in Syria would have a bearing on United States national interests \"both in \nterms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our \nallies, our bases in the region.\"  Nevertheless, the United States leader struck a cautious note, reminding journalists \nthat his country  was still in the process of seeking confirmation on the matter of chemical weapons usage; \nhowever, he asserted that if the allegations proved to be true, the crisis would \"require America's attention.\"  Left \nunsaid was the nature of that attention.  For his part, President Obama urged prudent action, tacitly reminding \npeople of the consequences of  the reckless military intervention of his predecessor, George W. Bush, into Iraq.  \nThe United States president said: \"Sometimes what we've seen is that folks will call for immediate action, jumping \ninto stuff, that does not turn out well, gets us mired in very difficult situations, can result in us being drawn into very \nexpensive, difficult, costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region.\"\n\nAround this time, Russia maintained its belief that the use of chemical agents might be a provocation by the \nopposition.  Still, Russia  was now urging Syria to cooperate with an  \"objective investigation\" by United Nations \nchemical weapons experts.  United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague indirectly addressed this suggestion \nthat the use of chemical agents was a provocation by rebel forces saying, \"I know that some people in the world \nwould like to say this is some kind of conspiracy brought about by the opposition in Syria. I think the chances of that \nare vanishingly small and so we do believe that this is a chemical attack by the Assad regime on a large scale.\"\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon demanded an immediate investigation to clear up the matter.  He \nsaid: \"I can think of no good reason why any party -- either government or opposition forces -- would decline this \nopportunity to get to the truth of the matter.\"  Ban also emphasized the fact that  any use of chemical weapons -- by \nany actor or party -- would be a violation of international law, which would inevitably result in \"serious \nconsequences for the perpetrator.\"\n\nUnited States weights its options:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, even as the evidence was increasing to support the claim of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, the \npolitical will to build an international coalition to act against Syria was eroding.  At issue was a parliamentary vote in \nthe United Kingdom's House of Commons urging an international response to the Syria chemical  weapons crisis.  \nThe vote came amidst British Prime Minister David Cameron's vociferous condemnation of Syria's apparent use of \nchemical weapons, and his suggestion that the United Kingdom would join the United States and France in \ndelivering some kind of punitive action against Syria. But when the parliamentary vote went down to defeat in the \nHouse on Commons on Aug. 29, 2013,  it was apparent that the United Kingdom would not be a player in any kind \nof military intervention.\n\nIrrespective of the political developments across the Atlantic, in the United States, President Barack Obama on \nAug. 30, 2013, made clear that he was  still considering  the full range of options in response to Syria's use of \nchemical weapons against its own citizens.\n\nReferring to the aforementioned report on the suspected chemical weapons usage in Syria released by Secretary of \nState Kerry, President Obama said, \"As you've seen, today we've released our unclassified assessment detailing \nwith high confidence that the Syrian regime carried out a chemical weapons attack that killed well over 1,000 \npeople, including hundreds of children. This follows the horrific images that shocked us all.\"\n\nWith an eye on showing why the use of chemical weapons required a response, President Obama said, \"This kind \nof attack is a challenge to the world. We cannot accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians \nare gassed on a terrible scale.\"  He continued, \"So, I have said before, and I meant what I said that, the world has \nan obligation to make sure that we maintain the norm against the use of chemical weapons.\"\n\nIn this way, the United States president was making it clear that the international community had an obligation to \nrespond to Syria's use of chemical weapons -- an act that was undertaken in defiance of international law and in \ncontravention to international norms.\n\nPresident Obama indicated that several options were under review, as he noted, \"Now, I have not made a final \ndecision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm. But as I've already said, I have had \nmy military and our team look at a wide range of options.\"\n\nThat being said, President Obama noted that a long-term campaign involving a ground force in Syria (reminiscent of \nIraq) were not among those possibilities. He expressly said, \"We're not considering any open-ended commitment. \nWe're not considering any boots on the ground approach. What we will do is consider options that meet the narrow \nconcern around chemical weapons.\" Evidently, although President Obama  believed there was a moral obligation to \nact against Syria for its use of chemical weapons, he was not eager to see the United States mired in another war \nin the world's most volatile region.  Stated differently, it was through the prism of the Iraq debacle that the United \nStates leader was viewing his options for dealing with Syria.\n\nSyria's stance:\n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly denied that his forces launched  any chemical attacks. The Syrian \nleader has warned of a wider Middle Eastern war if  foreign countries decide to move forward with military action \nagainst Syria.  That wider war could occur if Assad decided to react to a yet-to-occur military strike by international \npowers on Syria.  Some of the possibilities available to Assad would include retaliatory attacks on pro-Western \nallies of the United States, such as Israel, Jordan, and Turkey.  But the reality was that Syria's military already had \nits hands full fighting the civil war at home.  Moreover, Syria likely could not risk sparking the ire of Israel,  with its \nown well-armed military, or Jordan, which hosts United States fighter jets, missiles and troops, or Turkey -- a NATO \n\n\n\nmember state.  Indeed, an attack on any NATO country, such as Turkey, would prompt a response from the entire \nsecurity alliance.\n\nNote on Russia's position:\n\nRussia has maintained the view that the notion of a  chemical attack by the Syrian government was inconceivable.  \nRussia has also indicted that it would block a resolution in the United Nations Security Council authorizing a use of \nforce against Syria.  However, in early September 2013, Russian President Putin indicated some softening of his \nstance as he noted that he could be persuaded to change his mind if provided with clear evidence of a chemical \nattack.  Russia has also long advocated for a negotiated or diplomatic settlement to the Syrian crisis.\n\nStatus update:\n\nOn Sept. 8, 2013, the European Union called for no action to go forward with regard to Syria until the findings on \nthe chemical agents were made available by the United Nations investigative team.  As well, plans for a full vote in \nthe United States Congress authorizing use of force against the Syria regime were cancelled.\n\nAt issue was an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough that emerged when United States Secretary of State John \nKerry uttered a (seemingly) off-hand remark during a  news conference in London on Sept. 9, 2013 with British \nForeign Secretary William Hague.  Secretary of State Kerry said that President Assad could prevent a military strike \non  Syria if he  handed over \"every single bit\" of his chemical weapons to the international community.  At the time, \nSecretary of State Kerry said that he did not expect Assad to respond to this call; but, in fact, the remark appeared \nto have sparked fresh possibilities for a diplomatic solution with Russia championing the idea of subjecting Syria's \nchemical weapons stockpile to international auditors, and then placing them under the aegis of international \njurisdiction. Syria -- Russia's client state in the Middle East -- was almost immediately scrambling to say that it \nwould be willing to move in this direction. That stance by Syria functioned also as an admission by the Syrian \nregime that it was, in fact, in possession of chemical weapons.  Until that moment, the Assad regime would not \neven acknowledge that reality.\n\nOn Sept. 10, 2013, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem offered a public admission of the Assad regime's \nchemical weapons stockpile when he said:  \"We are ready to inform about the location of chemical weapons, halt \nthe production of chemical weapons, and show these objects to representatives of Russia, other states and the \nUnited Nations.\" He continued, \"Our adherence to the Russian initiative has a goal of halting the possession of all \nchemical weapons.\"\n\nOn the night of Sept. 10, 2013, United States President Obama delivered a national address on the Syrian issue.  \nOriginally, the speech had been regarded as an opportunity for the president to build congressional support -- then, \nat anemic levels -- for authorizing strikes against Syria, and assuring a war-weary and skeptical  nation that such \naction was necessary. Now, however, the speech had a two-fold purpose -- to bolster that aforementioned case \nagainst Syria, but also to address the emerging diplomatic channel.\n\nAs regards the former objective, President Obama presented a succinct case for acting against Syria.  President \nObama emphasized his conviction that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical toxins attack that \nensued around Ghouta on Aug. 21, 2013, characterizing the scene of death as  \"sickening,\" reminding the global \ncommunity that such an  attack was  a violation of international law, and warning Americans that it  posed a threat \nto United States national security.\n\nBut the president also opened the door to a negotiated settlement on the issue of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal \nand usage. He said that the Russian plan to report Syria's chemical weapons arsenal and place them under the \naegis of international jurisdiction constituted \"encouraging signs\" and announced that he would pursue a \"diplomatic \n\n\n\npath.\"  The president said that his top diplomat, Secretary of State Kerry, would travel to Geneva in Switzerland to  \nmeet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, with an eye on pursuing a negotiated settlement on the issue of \ndealing with Syria's chemical weapons.\n\nPresident Obama offered cautious support for this path forward, saying, \"It's too early to tell whether [the plan] \nwould succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments. But this initiative has \nthe potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one \nof Assad's strongest allies.\"  President Obama defended his decision to consider military strikes against Syria, \narguing that the current diplomatic opening was only possible as  a result of the credible threat of military force by \nthe United States.  Accordingly, the United States leader made it clear that his country's armed forces would \nmaintain their posture, saying: \"Meanwhile, I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture, to keep the \npressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.\"\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2013, Russia officially handed over its plan for  placing Syria's stockpile under international control to \nthe United States.  Discussion over its contents was expected to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, between \nUnited States Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.\n\nThose negotiations would be of a bilateral nature.\n\nThe Obama administration announced that in addition to Secretary of State Kerry's meeting with Foreign Minister \nLavrov, the United States' top diplomat would also  meet with the United Nations-Arab League special envoy on \nSyria, Lakhdar Brahimi.\n\nThe diplomatic path was not without serious obstacles.  Russia was demanding that the United States withdraw its \nthreat of force, while France -- the United States' ally on the issue of action against Syria -- was crafting a United \nNations Security Council resolution that would include a provision for precisely such action, should Syria fail to \ncomply with the dictates of the plan.  At issue was France's inclusion of a Chapter VII provision (of the United \nNations charter), which would effectively authorize  the use of force if Syria failed to adhere to its stated obligations.\n\nFor its part, Russia advocated for a non-binding declaration supporting its initiative.\n\nAt stake  in that initiative was a  demand for Syria to provide a full audit of its chemical weapons -- including \nvarieties of toxins and storage locations -- within 15 days, as well as procedures facilitating the transfer of control  \nover those chemical substances, and ultimately, their destruction.  Of course, the issue of destruction itself \npresented a disagreement between Russia and Syria with the latter not keen on that aspect of the plan.  Still, with \nthe client state of Syria reliant on Russia to save the regime from United States strikes, it was likely that the arsenal \nof chemical toxins would ultimately be set for elimination.\n\nComplicating the diplomatic  path was an opinion editorial piece penned by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which \nwas published  by the New York Times.  At the more conventional level, the piece included a fulsome plea for \ndiplomacy by Putin as follows:  \"The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition \nfrom many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent \nvictims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria's borders.\"\n\nPutin also urged international action via global instruments of jurisprudence, noting that any actions should go \nthrough the United Nations Security Council, which stood as \"one of the few ways to keep international relations \nfrom sliding into chaos.\" Putin also offered the reasonable argument that the United Nations could go down the road \nof obsolescence as its precursor, the League of Nations, if \"influential countries bypass the United Nations and take \nmilitary action without Security Council authorization.\"\n\n\n\nLeft unstated by the Russian leader, however, was the fact that his country's penchant for United Nations \nauthorization for the use of force was not at play during the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary, the Czech \nRepublic, and  Afghanistan, or even  its limited engagement in the Georgian territory of South Ossetia most \nrecently.\n\nThe most incendiary element in  Putin's editorial was perhaps his chastisement of President Obama's declaration \non United States' exceptionalism.  Putin argued against that claim, stating: \"And I would rather disagree with a case \nhe made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is What makes America different...it's \nwhat makes us exceptional. It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, \nwhatever the motivation.\"  This statement was a stunning example of irony coming from a world leader who \ndeclared to his fellow Russians in February 2013:  \"We are a victorious people! It is in our genes, in our genetic \ncode!\"\n\nThe Obama administration responded to this provocative opinion piece by Putin a day later on Sept. 12, 2013 with \nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney  saying, \"It's worth also pointing out there's a great irony in the placement \nof an op-ed like this, because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition of this country of freedom of expression.\"  \nCarney then went on to note that freedom of expression and free speech were \"on the decrease in Russia.\"  Carney \nalso used the occasion to place the burden of the success of a diplomatic path on Russia, noting that the Russian \npresident had placed his \"prestige and credibility on the line\" in offering a proposal to Syria to turn over its chemical \nweapons.\n\nThe Putin versus Obama contretemps aside, the diplomatic channels remained open.  On Sept. 12, 2013, the \nUnited Nations announced that it had  received documents from Syria, effectively acceding to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, which prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons. Syrian Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations,  Bashar Ja'afar, said, \"Legally speaking Syria has become, starting today, a full member of the \n(chemical weapons) convention.\"\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations were ongoing in Geneva (Switzerland) between the top diplomats from the United States \nand Russia respectively -- Secretary of State Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov -- with leaks indicating that the two \nmen enjoyed good rapport.  The negotiations were being characterized as \"constructive\" and went late into the wee \nhours of Sept. 14, 2013, suggesting that climate was ripe with the possibility of forging a deal.\n\nChemical Weapons Deal\n\nOn Sept. 14, 2013,  United States Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov announced that a \nbreakthrough agreement had been reached and that diplomacy had won the day. Speaking at a joint news \nconference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, Secretary of State John Kerry said of the \nconcord: \"If fully implemented, this framework can provide greater protection and security to the world.\"\n\nThe agreement , titled \"Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons,\"  calls for a full accounting of its \nchemical weapons stockpile within one week, the destruction of all  production equipment  by November 2013, and \nthe elimination  or transfer of the arsenal of chemical weapons by the middle of 2014. Achieving the objectives of \nthe agreement promised to be difficult.  A one week deadline for a full audit of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal \nwas strenuously aggressive.  As well, the destruction of production equipment and chemical toxins by 2014 was \nconsidered unprecedented since previous processes of this nature have typically taken several years to complete.  \nMoreover, there would be complicated questions yet to address, such as how to ensure the safety of international \ninspectors in Syria.\n\nIt should also be noted that agreement on a United Nations Security Council resolution mandating Syrian \ndisarmament on chemical weapons still promised to be potentially fractious.  Russia was reluctant to the notion of \n\n\n\nadding a Chapter VII provision (authorizing the use of force if Syria reneged on its obligations) to the resolution, \nalthough Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov intimated that the provision could be added in the future in a worse case \nscenario.  As such, the United States was not expected  to press for that particular inclusion at this time.\n\nThe diplomatic breakthrough and the  agreement itself were thus  being lauded by all veto-wielding members of the \nUnited Nations Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China), as well as the \nbroader United Nations and NATO.  But with the same lack of diplomatic restraint shown by Russian President \nPutin in his opinion editorial in the New York Times, Syria's Assad regime hailed the breakthrough agreement as a \n\"victory\" for that country. Syrian Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar declared in an interview with Russian media, \"It's \na victory for Syria achieved thanks to our Russian friends.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Kerry quelled Assad regime's bravado warning on Sept. 15, 2013 that the United \nStates retained its right to carry out punitive strikes against Syria, if that country did not meet its publicy stated \ninternational obligations. Secretary of State Kerry said, \"If diplomacy has any chance to work, it must be coupled \nwith a credible military threat.\"  \"We cannot have hollow words in the conduct of international affairs,\" Kerry added.\n\nAlready, President Obama in the United States had reminded the Syrian regime that while the agreement was \"an \nimportant step\" in the right direction,  his country reserved the right to act against Syria for failing to meet its \nobligations.  The United States leader said, \"If diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act.\"  Indeed, \nthe United States Pentagon noted that the United States military remained in a posture poised for military strikes \nagainst Syria.\n\nWithin the rebel ranks, the agreement was being regarded with scorn and bitterness.  Indeed, the military leader of \nthe anti-Assad Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, dismissed the deal as irrelevant, saying, \"All of this initiative \ndoes not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the Syrian people.\" Idriss also cast the deal as a \nRussian plan intended to gift the Assad regime with more time, and as such, he  vowed to keep up the fight.\n\nSpecial Report: \n\nSuicide bomber attacks train station in Russia; trolley bus attack follows the next day\n\nSummary\n\nAn attack on a train station in Volgograd in southern Russia on Dec. 29, 2013, left at least 15 people dead and \nscores more injured.  A day later on Dec. 30, 2013, another bomb attack ensued in the very same Russian city of \nVolgograd.  This time, the explosion struck a trolley bus. The blast, which occurred just as people were going to \nwork in the morning rush hour, left between 10 and 15  people dead and more than 20 others injured.  All eyes were \non Islamist extremists, who have been carrying out an insurgency in the North Caucasus region, as the likely \nculprits. With the attacks occuring only six weeks ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in  Sochi, there were \nincreased anxieties over the threat of terrorism in Russia.  To that end, the Russian government called on the \ninternational community to close ranks in the fight against extremism and terrorism.\n\nIn Detail\n\nAn attack on a train station in Volgograd in southern Russia on Dec. 29, 2013, left at least 15 people dead and \nscores more injured. Children were among the victims.  The bomb reportedly contained more than 20 pounds of \nexplosives and contained shrapnel; it was detonated close to the metal detectors at the entrance of the train \nstation.  The conventional wisdom was that the presence of security personnel at the location of the blast likely \n\n\n\nensured the death toll was not higher. Not surprisingly, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that security at \nairports and train stations would be increased in response to the attack\n\nAt first, Russian authorities said that a female suicide bomber -- possibly from Dagestan -- was likely responsible for \nthe attack, which they made clear was an act of terrorism.  A government spokesperson said the suicide attacker \nwas likely looking to another target but having seen security personnel on the scene, she opted to detonate the \nbomb in her possession at the train stationentrance. Subsequently, contradictory reports were emerging suggesting \nthat the suicide bomber may have been a backpack-wearing male.\n\nThe issue of who might be responsible became more mysterious a day later on Dec. 30, 2013, when another bomb \nattack ensued in the very same Russian city of Volgograd.  This time, the explosion struck a trolley bus close to a \nbusy market in Volgograd's Dzerzhinsky district. The blast, which occurred just as people were going to work in the \nmorning rush hour, left between 10 and 15  people dead and more than 20 others injured. Children were among the \nvictims. As was the case the day before, Russian authorities emphasized that the violence was the result of \nterrorism, and noted that because the same type of explosives were used in both the train station and trolley bus \nattacks, both incidences were clearly linked together.\n\nIt should be noted that only days before the Volgograd train station  and trolley bus attacks, there was a car \nbombing in the southern Russian city of Pyatigorsk.  The attack, which was reported to have been carried out by  \nIslamic extremists, left three people dead. Noteworthy was the fact that Pyatigorsk has been the focus of a federal \nadministrative district aimed at stabilizing the North Caucasus region. As well, Volgograd was the site of a previous \nterrorist attack at a bus station in October 2013.  In that incident, the  female suicide bomber was believed to be a \nmember of an Islamic separatist group known as Caucasus Emirate and detonated the explosives strapped to her \nvest on a bus in Volgogra; that attack killed eight people.\n\nIt should be noted that so-called \"Black Widows\" have increasingly been responsible for terrorist acts linked with the \nNorth Caucasus.  The women -- mostly the widows or female relatives of militants killed in action -- have become \nmore active in the ongoing Islamic extremist insurgency and the effort to create an Islamic Caliphate in the North \nCaucasus region.  Indeed, \"Black Widows\" could trace their activism to bombing attacks in the late 1990s although \nthey entered the public purview in 2002 following their involvement in the 2002 terrorist attack on the Dubrovka \ntheater in Moscow.\n\nIt was to be seen if they were involved, once again, in the Volgograd bloodshed.\n\nRegardless of the precise identity of the main actors in the Volgograd attacks in December 2013,  all eyes were on \nIslamist extremists as the likely culprits.\n\nWith the attacks occuring only six weeks ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi, there \nwere increased anxieties over the threat of terrorism in Russia. Earlier, in July 2013, Doku Umarov -- an Islamic \nextremist Chechen leader, called on other militants to deploy \"maximum force\" in the effort to target civilians, and \neven to interrupt the 2014 Olympics.\n\nIn truth, the connection between  Volgograd and Sochi was a bit murky. Nevertheless, the  fact of the matter was \nthat the city of Volgograd was located 600 miles from Sochi and was regarded as a gateway to the Caucasus. \nIndeed,  Volgograd --  once known as Stalingrad -- has been the main railway hub along the route connecting \nEuropean Russia with central Asia.\n\n\n\nFor its part, the government of Russia called for international solidarity in the fight against terrorism, which was \ncharacterized as \"an insidious enemy that can only be defeated together.\"  The international community was quick \nto respond to this call with British Prime Minister David Cameron saying via Twitter,  \"I've written to President Putin \nto say the UK will help Russia in whatever way we can.\" On behalf of the Obama administration in the United \nStates, the  White House National Security Council issued the following statement: \"The United States stands in \nsolidarity with the Russian people against terrorism. The U.S. government has offered our full support to the \nRussian government in security preparations for the Sochi Olympic Games, and we would welcome the opportunity \nfor closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants.\"\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nSochi winter Olympics begin; Russian government's attention focused on North Caucasus terrorism threat\n\nSummary:\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2014, the Winter Olympics began in the Russian city of Sochi on the Black Sea.  The 2014 Olympiad \nwould be known as the most expensive in history -- largely as a result of the security threat posed by Islamist \nextremist separatists from the North Caucasus region.  Fears of attacks by militant terrorist cast a shadow on the \nhighly anticipated games, which Russian President Vladimir Putin hoped would highlight his country's emerging \ndominance on the world stage.  Nevertheless, President Putin has insisted that  visitors to Sochi for the Winter \nOlympics  would be safe.  He pointed to the experience Russia has had in carrying out secure international events, \nsuch as the G8 and G20 summits, as well as the extraordinary security measures (discussed below) being taken to \nensure that the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi went off in a successful manner.\n\nIn Detail:\n\nIn the second week of January 2014, Russian authorities announced the arrest of five North Caucasus terror \nsuspects. The arrests were made in the  town of Nalchik, 185 miles to the east of the city of Sochi  on the Black \nSea,  where the 2014 Winter Olympics  were set to start two  weeks later.  According to the National Anti-Terrorist \nCommittee in Russia, the five suspects were reported to be in possession of a massive arsenal of weapons, \nincluding \"grenades, ammunition, and a homemade explosive device packed with shrapnel.\"  The particular items in \nthis cache indicated plans for some sort of bombing operation and rang alarm bells about the possibility of not only \nthe threat of terrorism at the hands of Muslim extremists from the North Caucasus, but also  their targeted sabotage \nof the impending Olympic Games.\n\nOnly a few weeks earlier in late 2013,  terrorism emanating from Muslim extremists of the North Caucasus struck \nRussia in the form of an attack on a train station in Volgograd, which left at least 15 people dead and scores more \ninjured.  A day later on Dec. 30, 2013, another bomb attack -- this time on a trolley bus -- ensued in the very same \nRussian city of Volgograd. The blast, which occurred just as people were going to work in the morning rush hour, \nkilled between 10 and 15  people dead and injured more than 20 others.\n\nAs Russian authorities carried out a security sweep ahead of the Sochi Olympics, they became engaged in a \nshootout in the in the Dagestan region of the North Caucasus.  According to Russia's National Anti-terrorism \nCommittee (NAC), the episode resulted in the deaths of three Russian servicemen and several gunmen  including \none  man accused of orchestrating a car bombing in the city of Pyatigorsk in late 2013.\n\n\n\nAround the same period in mid-January 2014, Russian security forces also announced the arrest of  five members \nof a banned militant group in southern Russia. Officials said the militants were in possession of a  homemade \nbomb packed with shrapnel that had to be defused.\n\nOn Jan. 17, 2014, there was a grenade attack outside a restaurant in  Makhachkala -- the regional capital of \nDagestan -- followed by the detonation of a car bomb timed to coincide with the arrival of police on the scene.  \nSeveral people were injured in that episode.  A  day later on Jan. 18, 2014, a siege at a house in  Makhachkala left \nseveral militants dead.  Those militants, which included one trained female suicide bomber,  were suspected of \nbeing behind the restaurant attack in Makhachkala.\n\nAll eyes  at the time were on Islamist extremists, who have been carrying out an insurgency in the North Caucasus \nregion, as the likely culprits. With the attacks occurring only weeks ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in  Sochi, \nthere was increased anxiety over the threat of terrorism in Russia.  Those anxieties were fueled by the recollection \nthat  Doku Umarov -- an Islamic extremist Chechen leader -- had called on other militants to deploy \"maximum \nforce\" in the effort to target civilians, and even to interrupt the 2014 Olympics.\n\nWith the threat of Islamic militants from the separatist North Caucasus region threatening to disrupt and even \nsabotage the Olympics, and with the record of attacks in Volgograd in late 2013, followed by the attack in  \nMakhachkala in early 2014, as well as the discovery of the weapons cache in Nalchick in January 2014, Russia \nannounced a draconian safety and security plan.  That security plan -- reported to be the biggest of any Olympics to \ndate, included the deployment of 30,000 police and interior ministry troops, backed by anti-aircraft missiles, war \nships, and military aircraft, all of which were placed on combat-ready status.  As well, Russian President Vladimir \nPutin signed as security decree that effectively established two security zones;  one \"controlled\"  zone would apply \nstringent security and document protocols  to visitors and vehicles, while a second closed  or \"forbidden\" zone  was \nestablished from the border with Abkhazia all  across major portions of the mountainous Sochi national park.  \nPresumably, the intent was to ensure safety  at a time when the world's  eyes would be on Sochi in Russia.\n\nBy the third week of January 2014, Russian authorities turned their attention towards a suspected female suicide \nbomber with an alleged plan to attack the Sochi Olympics.  Wanted posters depicting  Ruzanna \"Salima\" \nIbragimova from Dagestan in the North Caucasus region have been circulated in Russia with authorities fearing that \nthe widow of an Islamist militant may have already  slipped into Sochi. Two other potential female suicide bombers -\n- quite likely so-called \"Black Widows\" as well -- were said to be in the region.  (Note that the Russian authorities \nlater took back these claims, suggesting that the Olympic city was safe.)\n\nThe Volgograd attacks  resurfaced in late  January 2014 -- just weeks ahead of the Sochi Olympics -- with an \nominous videotaped warning  by two young  Islamic militants believed to be the suicide bombers in those two \nepisodes of terrorism that plagued Russia in December 2013.  The footage, which was posted on a Jihadist \nwebsite, showed the (now deceased) militants issuing the following warning: \"We've prepared a present for you and \nall tourists who'll come over. If you will hold the Olympics, you'll get a present from us for the Muslim blood that's \nbeen spilled.\"\n\nIntensifying the climate of anxiety was the news that North Caucasus Islamic militants dispatched email threats to \nthe national teams of certain European countries and the United States at the Sochi Olympics.  In response, United \nStates  President Barack Obama offered his \"full assistance\" in ensuring the Olympics at Sochi were  \"safe and \nsecure.\" To that end, two United States warships and several transport aircraft would be on standby in the Black \nSea for the opening of the Sochi Olympics; the United States would also  supply Russia with technologically \nsophisticated  equipment able to detect improvised explosives.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Russian President Putin insisted that  visitors to Sochi for the Winter Olympics  would be safe.  He \npointed to the experience Russia has had in carrying out secure international events, such as the G8 and G20 \nsummits, as well as the extraordinary security measures (discussed above) being taken in preparation for the 2014 \nWinter Olympics in Sochi.\n\nBy the first week of February 2014, Russian security forces announced the elimination of  a militant they said may \nhave orchestrated the  suicide bombings at Volgograd discussed above.  Russian security forces said that \nDzamaltin Mirzayev had been killed during a gun battle with law enforcement officers outside a house in the North \nCaucasus province of Dagestan.  Located on the Caspian Sea about to the southeast of Sochi,  Dagestan has \nbeen known for its notorious record of daily violence associated with the ongoing separatist aspirations of militant \nIslamists.  According to Russian authorities, Mirzayev  was thought to have been responsible for dispatching two \nassailants to  Volgograd to carry out back-to-back attacks in late December 2013.\n\nWhile this development was a boon for Russian authorities, who were beset by negative Olympic publicity over the \nsecurity concerns (as well as unfinished or \"problem\" infrastructure and  controversial anti-gay legislation ), there \nwere further wrinkles on the security scene.  On the eve of the opening of the Sochi Olympics, the United States \nDepartment of Homeland Security issued a warning to airlines flying to Russia, saying that terrorists might attempt \nto smuggle explosives on board aircrafts by hiding them in toothpaste tubes.\n\nLaw enforcement experts suggested that the explosives transported in this manner could be assembled  either \"in \nflight\" or upon arrival at the Olympics in Russia. Due to the looming threat, United States authorities went so far as \nto ban liquids on all flights from the United States to Russia.\n\nNote that on Feb. 7, 2014, the  Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympics began at Fisht Olympic Stadium in \nSochi.  The event was marked -- as is traditional -- by the parade of nations, the athletes' oath, addresses by \ndignitaries, and performances aimed at highlighting Russia's illustrious cultural contributions to world history. \nNotably, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the games of the Winter 2104 Olympiad open.\n\nVarious international heads of state were in attendance including Chinese President Xi Jinping of China, Prince \nAlbert of  Monaco, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg,  King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, Emir Tamim bin \nHamad Al Thani of Qatar,  President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, President Serge Sarkisian of Armenia, President \nSauli Niinisto of Finland, President Filip Vujanovic of Montenegro,  President Tomislav Nikolic of Serbia,  President \nOlafur Ragnar Grimsson of Iceland, and President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj of Mongolia, among others. Conspicuously \nabsent were the leaders of the leading Western nations, such as the United States, the United Kingdom,  France, \nGermany, and Canada.\n\nSpecial Note on Chechnya\n\nIn December 2014, ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's annual state of the union address, violence broke \nout in Chechnya. At issue was an incident in which gunmen opened fire on security forces and then stormed a \nmedia office building in  the  Chechen capital Grozny.  The ambush led to a violent gun battle, which ultimately \nresulted in the deaths of six gunmen and  three police officers.  Ramzan Kadyrov, the  Kremlin-backed leader of \nChechnya, remarked on the developments via social media, writing  that \"six terrorists were annihilated\" following \nthe fracas.\n\nFor their part, Muslim extremists claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that it was carried out as an act of \nretaliation against the oppression of Muslim women in the Islamic separatist republic.  While Chechynya has been \nunder the harsh hand of Kadyrov,  Islamic insurgency and terrorism continues to plague the North Caucasus \nregion.  Indeed, only two months prior in October 2014, a suicide bomber killed five policemen and injured a dozen \nother individuals when he strategically detonated the explosives strapped to his body just as police officers walked \nup to him to request identification.\n\n\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nThe militant Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus has steadily expanded past Chechnya's borders to \nneighboring territories, such as Dagestan and Ingushetia, and the cause itself has moved past establishing an \nindependent Chechnya to a broader Jihadist goal in the Caucasus. To be clear, an Islamic insurgency emanating \nfrom the North Caucasus has bedeviled the Russian Federation for close to two decades. Despite successful \noffensive operations by the Russian military in the North Caucasus, violence by Islamist separatist militants has \nbeen ongoing. At issue has been the Chechen mandate to create an independent Islamic state and the willingness \nof the Chechen militants to use terrorism and violence to achieve their ends.\n\nWhile the mainstream media has focused on this separatist war carried out by extremist Islamic insurgents from \nChechnya, the neighboring restive provinces in the North Caucasus have also been engulfed in the conflict. The \nepicenter of the Islamic separatist insurgency is, of course, Chechnya, which has been in state of war for some \ntime; however, neighboring Dagestan and Ingushetia have been intensely affected and a discussion of Islamic \ninsurgency in Russia can not ensue without including all three territories. Dagestan is the site of militant activity, and \na frequent target of terrorism and violent criminality, with attacks occurring on a daily basis.  Meanwhile, Ingushetia \nis a literal war zone. Other parts of the North Caucasus have also seen violence -- North Ossetia is the site of \nmilitant activity, while Kabardino-Balkaria is often caught in the crossfire of violence between government forces \nand Chechen rebels.\n\nThe area is beset by daunting poverty and Russian leaders, such as Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, have offered \nthe view that poverty alleviation in the region should be part of the solution aimed at stabilization of the area. \nIndeed, expert analysts have, likewise, noted that poor socio-economic conditions constitute the stimulus for many \nyouth to join extremist Islamic militant groups in the North Caucasus. At the same time, it must be emphasized that \nrevenge and resistance against the brutal tactics of the Russian military are part of the equation, ultimately serving \nto augment extremism and militancy, and create more fertile political soil for radical action.\n\nOf particular note has been the militancy of so-called \"Black Widows\" who  have increasingly been responsible for \nterrorist acts linked with the North Caucasus.  The women -- mostly the widows or female relatives of militants killed \nin action -- have become more active in the ongoing Islamic extremist insurgency and the effort to create an Islamic \nCaliphate in the North Caucasus region.  Indeed, \"Black Widows\" could trace their activism to bombing attacks in \nthe late 1990s although they entered the public purview in 2002 following their involvement in the terrorist attack on \nthe theater in Moscow (mentioned below).\n\nThe motivation of extremism and militancy aside, it should be noted that terrorism by Islamic extremists on Russian \nterrain is not a new phenomenon. Militant Islamic extremists from the North Caucasus have been behind a host of \nterrorist attacks over the years. In 2002, Chechen rebels carried out a siege on a theater in Moscow. The Chechen \nmilitant rebels who took over the  Dubrovka theater demanded an end to the war in Chechnya, and threatened to \nkill the hostages if their demands were not met. The grave situation demanded a rapid and overwhelming response \nby Russian authorities and, indeed, most of the hostages were eventually freed when Russian forces stormed the \ntheater. However, 116 hostages were killed in the rescue operation, due to the indiscriminate use of an unspecified \nsleep-inducing agent by the Russians to deal with the Chechen rebels. In 2004, Chechen terrorists carried out a \nbrutal and bloody attack on a school in Beslan, in which hundreds of people were taken hostage. A two day siege \nended with a bloodbath in which more than 300 people were killed under the most horrific conditions. At least half \nthe victims in that case were children. In 2009, the express train from Moscow to St. Petersburg was hit by North \nCaucasus Islamic terrorists. In 2010, militant extremists stormed the parliament in Chechnya. That same year, the \nMoscow underground transit system was hit by two female suicide bombers from Dagestan. In 2011, a bomb \nattack at Moscow's Domodedovo airport left more than 35 people dead and at least 170 others wounded -- many of \n\n\n\nthem critically. The suicide bomber in that attack was identified as a 20-year-old man from the North Caucasus \nalthough a Chechen warlord, Doku Umarov, had claimed responsibility for orchestrating the attack at the Moscow \nairport.  As discussed here, December 2013 brought terrorism in the form of an attack on a train station in \nVolgograd, which left at least 15 people dead and scores more injured.  A day later, another bomb attack -- this \ntime on a trolley bus -- ensued in the very same Russian city of Volgograd and left 10 and 15  people dead. At the \nstart of 2014, a grenade attack ensued outside a restaurant in  Makhachkala followed by the detonation of a car \nbomb timed to coincide with the arrival of police on the scene. North Caucasus terrorists were said to be \nresponsible for this latest episode of violence.\n\nThe Chechen leader, Doku Umarov, who has been seen as more of a philosophical separatist leader than a military \nfigure, claimed responsibility for a number of these terrorist attacks, including the double suicide bombing of the \nMoscow subway system in 2010 and an attack on the Moscow airport in 2011. In fact, Umarov has threatened \nfurther attacks, insinuating that the extremist Islamic insurgency would intensify with more \"special operations\" in \nthe future if Russia refused to allow the Caucasus to become an independent Islamic state. In a videotaped \nmessage in 2011, he warned, \"Among us there are hundreds of brothers who are prepared to sacrifice themselves.\" \nUmarov's warning served as both a clarifier of sorts. Specifically, it was becoming increasingly clear that the \nambitions of Islamist extremists had expanded from the goal of Chechnya's independence to a broader Jihadist \nambition of creating an Islamic state across the Caucasus, governed by Shar'ia law. This broader objective \nexplained the widening of the Jihadist cause -- from a concentrated geopolitical center in Chechnya to a broader \nclaim across the Northern Caucasus. By 2013, Umarov had cancelled a moratorium on killing civilians and was \nurging militants to use  \"maximum force\" in the effort to sabotage the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.  While those \ngames passed without incident, attacks by Islamic separatist terrorists continued to plague the region as of the \nclose of 2014.\n\nSpecial Entry on Ukraine's Uprising and Russian annexation of Crimea\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nFollowing landmark uprising in Ukraine, Russia annexes Crimea in new East-West confrontation; anxieties raised \nover Russian nationalist ambitions to recapture Soviet-era territory\n\nSummary:\nTurbulence and turmoil have  characterized the landscape in Ukraine. Tensions initially flared in late 2013 in \nresponse to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision not to move forward with a pending association \nagreement with the European Union.  That decision brought more than 100,000 protesters to the streets to rally \nagainst what they saw as Ukraine's movement towards greater control by Russia.  Indeed, the general consensus \nwas that President Yanukovych had bent to pressure by President Vladimir Putin of Russia to step away from the \nEuropean Union Association Agreement and instead embrace a customs union with Russia.\n\nBy the start of 2014, another flare of protests ensued in Ukraine in response to legislation passed by members of \nparliament loyal to President Yanukovych. The laws at stake were intended to curb the free expression of political \nopposition and curtail public protests.  The passage of such legislation raised the ire of Ukrainians, particularly \nthose aligned with the opposition, and alarmed the West  with the United States and European Union worried about \nthe Ukraine's slide into autocracy under Yanukovych.  In a twist of irony, the very laws intended to suppress mass \naction actually spurred exactly that end as mass protests attracting tens of thousands of  people once again rocked \nUkraine.  As January 2014 entered its final week, concessions by President Yanukovych to include members of the \nopposition in government yielded no positive results.  Instead, the unrest spread to the eastern part of the country.  \nWith the situation deteriorating, the prime minister and the government resigned, and the Ukrainian parliament \nrepealed the controversial anti-protest laws.\n\nIn mid-February 2014, the turmoil re-ignited as police tried to clear the main protest camp.  Ukraine was again \nthrust into a renewed state of turbulence and turmoil. A truce was forged on Feb. 19, 2014, but only after more than \n\n\n\ntwo dozen people died.  That truce collapsed a day later, effectively returning the capital city of Kiev to a battle zone \nand leading to an increasing death toll.  Yet another agreement was forged in which the president conceded to \nmany of the demands of the opposition.  But the deal appeared to have come to late to appease an enraged \npopulace.  By Feb. 22, 2014,  President Yanukovych had fled to the eastern part of the country while his party \nabandoned him and joined the opposition to officially impeach him, while his political nemesis - former Prime \nMinister Tymoshenko - was freed from captivity.\n\nThe move was a clear message to Moscow that Ukraine would not be controlled by Russia and that Ukraine instead \nwas looking toward Europe as it charted its future path.  Indeed, to the chagrin of Russia, the new interim president \nof Ukraine declared the country would pursue closer ties with the European Union.  The winds of change had swept \nacross Ukraine with the \"Maidan\" or Independence Square stamped in the history books as \"Ground Zero\" of \nUkraine's 2014 battleground.\n\nBut the celebration in Ukraine did not last long. The battleground terrain shifted eastward at the start of March 2014 \nwhen the Russian parliament granted Russian President Putin authorization to use force in Ukraine, and Russian \nforces annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.  Clearly, Putin and Russia felt entitled to reclaim their foothold in \nUkraine, thus recalling alarming memories  for the rest of the world of the Soviet invasion of then-Czechoslovakia in \n1968  to subdue the independence-minded Prague Spring.  Adding to the crisis was the perplexing decision by \nRussian President Putin to refuse to acknowledge that Russian troops were even in Crimea.\n\nIn response to Russia's actions against Ukraine, and particularly in the direction of controlling Crimea, the G7 \ncountries (G8 minus Russia) pulled out of preparations for the G8 summit set to take place in Russia and the United \nStates  instituted targeted sanctions against Russian officials.\n\nTalks aimed at resolving the crisis yielded no results.  Indeed, an East-West conflict was intensifying as  Crimea \nscheduled a referendum  for mid-March 2014 when residents would decide whether or not to join Russia.  A \nmeeting between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and United States Secretary of State Kerry  ended in failure. \nBecause Russia viewed the overthrow of Yanukovych as illegal, and because the West viewed Crimea's decision to \njoin Russia was in violation of international law,  an impasse was at hand.\n\nThe United States  and the European Union respectively warned that such a unilateral action would run counter to \ninternational law, and thus they would not recognize the likely ratification of Crimean unification with Russia.  For its \npart, Ukraine insisted that it would not accept the fracturing of its territorial integrity.\n\nMeanwhile, the West attempted to condemn Crimea's secession referendum, and issue its support for Ukraine's \nsovereignty,  by moving forward with a resolution in the United Nations Security Council.  As expected, Russia -- as \na veto-wielding permanent member -- vetoed the draft.  Every other Security Council member voted in favor of the \nmeasure, with the exception of China, which abstained from the vote.  The inaction at the Security Council was \nreminiscent of the Cold war era in which both sides habitually vetoed the other's measures, essentially creating a \nstate of diplomatic paralysis.\n\nOn March 16, 2014, ethnic Russians in Crimea voted overwhelmingly to secede from Ukraine and unite with \nRussia.  Crimea then officially requested that the \"Republic of Crimea\" be admitted as a new subject to the Russian \nFederation.\n\nOn the Russian side of the equation, Russia recognized Crimea as a sovereign entity.  Russian President Putin \nsoon responded by officially annexing Crimea.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed  personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials.  This \npunitive action was intended as a rebuke against the actions in Crimea; however, there was no sign that Russia \nwas even slightly daunted by its decision to seize control of a territory belonging to Ukraine under the established \n\n\n\nsystem of international jurisprudence.  As stated above, Russia justified its moves by asserting that the interim post-\nYanukovych government in Ukraine was illegitimate.\n\nRussian ambitions to regain territory lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union soon entered into the equation.  \nOf note was the fact that in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea, Russian attention was glancing towards \nother parts of eastern Ukraine.  Eruptions of unrest in this Russian-speaking part of Ukraine were blamed on \nRussia, and reminiscent of what had transpired in Crimea.  Indeed, Ukraine was accusing Russia of carrying out its \nCrimea formula by  orchestrating unrest further into Ukrainian territory.\n\nIt was to be seen if the landscape in eastern Europe in the spring of 2014 represented the foundation for a renewed \nCold War between the East and West.  It was also possible that President Barack Obama of the United States was \ncorrect in dismissing such a notion on the basis of the fact that Russia was no longer a super power and, instead, a \nregional power acting as a bully against its neighbors.\n\nNote that a presidential election was held in Ukraine on May 25, 2014. Petro Poroshenko claimed victory in \nUkraine's  presidential contest but turmoil continued to rock Ukraine.  Entering the fray at the start of June 2014, \nNATO moved to bolster its security presence in eastern Europe as a deterrent against Russian aggression.\n\nIn June and July 2014, Ukrainian forces made some progress in retaking the rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine, \nwhile the United States intensified its sanctions against Russian companies as a punitive measure against Russia \nfor failing to de-escalate the conflict.\n\nThe landscape in eastern Ukraine took a disturbing turn on July 17, 2014, when a civilian passenger aircraft \ntraveling from Netherlands to Malaysia went down in eastern Ukraine.  All 298 people aboard the Boeing 777 \nairliner perished when Malaysian Airlines flight 17 crashed in the rebel-held territory of Donesk close to the Russian \nborder. That event augured a geopolitical land mine as Ukraine said the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down \nand placed the blame on pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces.  The tragedy of the Malaysian Airlines \nflight occurred one day after the Obama administration in the United States unveiled harsh punitive sanctions \nagainst major Russian firms aligned with Russian President Putin.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight, and because the majority of the victims with \nDutch nationals, Europe's stance against Russia hardened.  Accordingly,  the West -- including the United States \nand the European Union --  intensified its sanctions regime against Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, in August 2014,  Ukrainian forces at first held the momentum in the fight to regain control over the pro-\nRussian eastern part of the country, particularly in separatist strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk.  However, \nRussian-backed separatists were vigorously defending what they viewed as their own territory later in the month.  \nBy the close of August 2014,  NATO said that Russian forces had violated Ukraine's territory while the Ukrainian \npresident warned that his country was on the brink of war with Russia.\n\nAt the start of September 2014, NATO announced a rapid reaction force as well as military exercises in eastern \nEurope.  Pressure from NATO and the threat of fresh sanctions by the European Union appeared to have spurred \npro-Russian separatists to go to the negotiating table with Ukrainian authorities.  There, a fragile truce was soon \nestablished but sporadically violated as fighting continued in Donetsk and Luhansk, and as Ukrainian forces fought \nto hold the port city of Mariupol.\n\nIn September 2014, with the ceasefire still in effect, Ukraine concentrated on the process of trying to retain its \nterritorial integrity while meeting the needs of the pro-Russian separatists. To that end, Ukraine unveiled a proposal \nthat would convey \"special status\" for eastern part of country, conveying greater autonomy.  Meanwhile, the \nUkrainian parliament advanced its pro-Western orientation by ratifying the Association Agreement with European \n\n\n\nUnion (the basis of the uprising that caused the ousting of Yanukovych in the first place), while Ukrainian President \nPoroshenko unveiled a package of reforms aimed at securing membership in the European Union.\n\nBy October 2014, Russian President  Putin was calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian border.  \nHowever, NATO was warning that there was no sign of Russian troops actually retreating from the border in any \nsignificant fashion; as well, Russian forces remained active within Ukraine in violation of that country's sovereignty.  \nUkrainian President Poroshenko viewed the strong election performance of allied pro-Western parties as a \nratification of, and a mandate for, his security plans for eastern Ukraine.  However, that eastern portion of the \ncountry was moving forward with illegal elections of their own, which were rejected by Ukraine and the larger \ninternational community, but which were (unsurprisingly) being backed by Russia.\n\nBy November 2014, fighting had erupted in the east, there were reports of a build up of pro-Russian reinforcements \nthere, and it was fair to say that the fragile ceasefire that had been in place since September 2014 was on the brink \nof collapse.\n\nDecember 2014 saw a prisoner exchange occur between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists. \nAs well, Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that he intended to meet with his Russian, French, and German \ncounterparts in early 2015 for discussions on the restoration of peace in the eastern part of the country.  These \nactions were regarded as positive steps in the arena of regional relations.  However, Ukraine's decision to revoke \nits neutral status -- a move that could potentially facilitate future NATO membership -- was likely to raise the ire of \nRussia, which has opposed Ukraine's westward drift from the onset.  Ironically, it was Russia's own aggressive \ninterventions in eastern Ukraine, particularly marked by the annexation of Crimea, that actually catalyzed Ukraine's \nhaste to move out of Russia's orbit.\n\nAt the start of 2015, the Minsk ceasefire agreement was effectively dead as fighting resumed around Donetsk and \nas pro-Russian separatists carried out an assault on the strategic port city of Mariupol, prompting Ukrainian \nPresident Poroshenko to warn that his forces would not bend to pro-Russian rebels and that Ukraine would protect \nits sovereignty.  Fighting had extended to other areas in Ukraine's east as pro-Russian separatists aggressively \nsought to consolidate control over what they have termed \"New Russia.\"\n\nAs the month of February 2015 began, there were reports that the Obama administration in the United States was \nconsidering additional support for Ukrainian forces in protecting Ukraine from the pro-Russian offensive.  As well, \nNATO was considering the establishment of special command units in eastern Europe to respond rapidly to threats \nin the region.\n\nNote that on Feb. 12, 2015, a new Minsk ceasefire agreement and a roadmap for peace were forged. But later in \nFebruary 2015, peace in eastern Ukraine remained elusive as pro-Russians took control over the town of \nDebaltseve and forced  Ukrainian forces into retreat.  Pro-Russian forces were reportedly attacking government-\nheld positions in eastern Ukraine -- including the area around the strategic port of Mariupol -- while Ukraine accused \nRussia of dispatching more troops and tanks to the region, specifically in the direction of the town of Novoazovsk on \nthe southern coast.\n\nMeanwhile, a year after the original Maidan uprising in Kiev ousted former pro-Russian President Yanukovych from \npower, Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv was struck by a bomb attack as demonstrators marched in a \nnational unity rally.  Despite the existence of the second Minsk ceasefire agreement, Ukraine was still occasionally \nmired by war and bloodshed.  Europe warned of further sanctions to come if violations to the truce occurred and, \nindeed, a fragile peace appeared to take hold in the region. Juxtaposed against this background came a surprising \nadmission from Russian President Putin that he had long-standing ambitions to regain Russian control over Crimea.\n\nBy mid-2015, despite the existing new Minsk ceasefire agreement, key areas of eastern Ukraine were beset by \nheavy fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists.\n\n\n\nTension were also rising over the findings of a  multinational investigation into the aforementioned tragedy of \nMalaysian Airlines Flight 17.  The inquest, led by the Dutch Safety Board,  indicated that a Russian Buk surface-to-\nsurface missile  was fired from a village in  eastern Ukraine under pro-Russian control and struck Malaysian Air \nFlight 17, precipitating the crash.\n\nAs such, there were ising calls for  an international tribunal to ensure justice was served.\n\nFor his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast the move as \"premature.\"\n\nAround the same period of mid-2015,  Ukraine's parliament was moving forward with constitutional reforms aimed \nat establishing temporary self-rule in the eastern part of the country under pro-Russian rebel rule.  The changes to \nthe constitution were aimed at meeting Ukraine's obligations under the prevailing MInsk peace accord.\n\nWhile the legislative progress in Ukraine signaled to some that the government in Kiev was adhering to its Minsk \npeace accord commitments,  Russia objected to the changes, arguing that they did not go far enough to fulfill the \nobligations of the Minsk.  There were also objections at home in Ukraine by nationalists to the deal that would grant \nautonomy to pro-Russian rebels.  Those protests in Kiev turned deadly, effectively expanding the landscape of \nunrest in Ukraine.\n\nIn September 2015, the schedule for local elections in the pro-Russian eastern part of Ukraine threatened to upend \nthe Minsk peace accord.  In the same period, Ukraine was calling on NATO to provide it with military weapons; \nhowever, NATO made clear that its priority was to ensure the implementation of the Minsk peace agreement .\n\nSee below for further details related to Russia's invasion, occupation, and annexation of Crimea following the \nousting of Yanukovych from power, as well as the ongoing unrest in eastern Ukraine, which has been blamed on \nRussia.\n\nRussia stakes its claim in Crimea:\n\nIrrespective of the ethos of celebration in Kiev following the ousting of Yanukovych, the close of February 2014 was \nalso marked by an ominous warning from Ukraine's new interim president, Turchynov, who said there were  \"signs \nof separatism\" in Russian-speaking Crimea in the eastern part of the country. That warning seemed prescient as \nresidents of  Crimea  were soon demanding that the region secede from Ukraine.\n\nOccupied by the Nazis in World War II, Crimea has long been a historic battleground through the course of history. \nIt was the central locus of the Crimean War involving Russia and the French-British-Ottoman alliance in the 19th \ncentury. Further back,  Scythians, Greeks,  Huns, Bulgars,  Turks,  Mongols, and others occupied or invaded the \nterritory, which was also part of the Roman and Byzantine empires  in ancient times.\n\nCrimea came under Russian/Soviet jurisdiction  but was transferred to Ukraine as a \"gift\" by Nikita Khrushchev in \n1954.  In more recent times, the Russian naval base has been located at Sevastopol in Crimea, with the Russian \nBlack Sea Naval Fleet based on the Crimean coast.\n\nTo date, the population of Crimea has remained heavily ethno-linguistically Russian,  however, ethnic Tartars -- as \nthe indigenous people of Crimea -- also call the region home, and do not necessarily align with the dominant pro-\nRussian sentiment there.  Indeed, ethnic Tartars take a dim view of Russia and the Soviet past, even harboring  \ndeep resentment over the dark days of Stalin's rule when  their people were deported en masse to Central Asia.\n\n\n\nGiven this complex socio-cultural composition of Crimea, the  Russian role in the region was emerging as a  \nprimary concern in the initial days after Ukraine's 2014 uprising.  Moscow made it clear that it would not engage \nwith the new government of Ukraine, which it viewed as illegitimate, and also pointed to the ethno-linguistic Russian \npopulation of eastern Ukraine, suggesting that they might need  \"protection\" from Russia in the face of the new pro-\nWestern leadership in Kiev. Going a step further in the direction of sabre rattling, Russia soon placed 150,000 \ncombat troops on alert  for war games close to the border with Ukraine -- presumably in preparation to take up the \nmission of \"protecting\" the Russian ethno-linguistic population of Crimea.\n\nThe fact that there was no sign of violence against ethno-linguistic Russians, this move by Moscow was regarded \nwith great suspicion.\n\nThe West had a very different view and wasted no time in expressing support for the interim leadership of Ukraine, \nand warning Russia from intervening into Ukrainian affairs.  At a meeting of the European parliament, European \nCommission President Jose Manuel Barroso said, \"I launch from here an appeal to all our international partners, in \nparticular Russia, to work constructively with us to guarantee a united Ukraine that can be a factor for stability in the \nEuropean continent.\"  He also expressed the European view that the removal of Yanukovych was the result of  the \nwill of the Ukrainian people and an act of self-determinism, saying, \"The winds of change are knocking again at \nUkraine's doors; the will of the people must prevail.\"  The United States struck a similar chord, with the Obama \nwhite House urging Russia to respect  Ukraine's territorial integrity.  White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said, \n\"We urge outside actors in the region to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, to end provocative \nrhetoric and actions, to support democratically established transitional governing structures and to use their \ninfluence in support of unity, peace and an inclusive path forward.\"  Meanwhile, in an interview with MSNBC, United \nStates  Secretary of State John Kerry said, \"We're hoping that Russia will not see this as sort of a continuation of \nthe Cold War...We do not believe this should be an East-West, Russia-United States (issue).\"\n\nBut the landscape in Ukraine was quickly turning tumultuous.  The stakes in an East-West confrontation intensified \non Feb. 26, 2014, when rival groups of demonstrators -- some of whom were  pro-Russian and others who wre anti-\nRussian -- erupted at the parliament building in Ukraine's Crimea  region.  The scene  devolved further when armed \nmen seized control of the parliament of Crimea in the  regional capital Simferopol, declared  Crimea to be an \nautonomous entity with its own constitution, and raised the Russian flag.\n\nThe area was soon being patrolled by Russian-speaking persons clothed in military garb but without specific \ninsignias.  Reporters on the scene asked some of these individuals where they were from and were told \"Russia\" in \nresponse. A Ukrainian official, Sergiy Kunitsyn, said in an interview with the media that Russian jets carrying  troops \nhad landed at a military air base near Simferopol. This claim by Kunitsyn was being treated as an unconfirmed \nreport; however, videotaped footage soon  emerged that appeared to  show Russian planes flying into Crimea.  \nSubsequently, further reports emerged suggesting that  two Russian anti-submarine warships were spotted off the \ncoast of Crimea in violation of prevailing agreements that limit the presence of Russia's Naval Fleet in the Black \nSea.\n\nAlarmed at the prospect of Russia either surreptitiously or even actively advancing into Ukraine, three former \nUkrainian presidents  -- Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, and Viktor Yushchenko -- crossed partisan lines to \njointly accuse Russia of \"direct interference in the political life in Crimea.\"  Meanwhile, Ukraine's interim President \nTurchinov demanded that Russia remain within its military confines at the naval base  saying, \"I am appealing to the \nmilitary leadership of the Russian Black Sea fleet...Any military movements, the more so if they are with weapons, \nbeyond the boundaries of this territory (the base) will be seen by us as military aggression.\"\n\nAt the international level, NATO  joined the fray as it urged Russia to refrain from doing anything that would \n\"escalate tension.\"\n\nAs well, United States Secretary of State John Kerry reminded  Russia that it has eschewed foreign intervention \ninto the affairs of sovereign countries, saying: \"For a country that has spoken out so frequently ... against foreign \n\n\n\nintervention in Libya, in Syria, and elsewhere, it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think \nabout options in the sovereign nation of Ukraine.\" Kerry  added, \"I don't think there should be any doubt whatsoever \nthat any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of Ukraine would be a huge -\n- a grave -- mistake.\"\n\nOn Feb. 28, 2014,  United States  President Barack Obama also registered his own warning to Russia, noting that  \n\"any violation of Ukraine sovereignty... would be deeply destabilizing\" and pointing to the potential \"costs\" of \nRussian intervention into Ukraine.\n\nThis warning fell on deaf ears.  It was now evident  that pro-Russian cadres of armed men were controlling major \nswaths of Crimea. Ukrainian interim President Turchynov thus accused Russia of trying to provoke an \"armed \nconflict\" in his country.  Turchynov suggested that Russian President Putin was trying to get the new interim \ngovernment  of Ukraine to react to Russian provocations in  a way that would justify the Russian annexation of \nCrimea.  Turchynov pointed to the fact that this modality had been used before by Russia in the Georgian territories \nof South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2008, which also were home to large ethno-linguistic populations but were legally \nunder Georgian jurisdiction.  Indeed, the Ukraine/Crimea issue was clearly reminiscent of the Russian intervention \ninto the Georgia/South Ossetia crisis in 2008 since both scenarios involved a Russian ethno-linguistic population in  \nsemi-autonomous enclaves of countries that  were longer part of the Soviet Union.  The only conclusion was that \nRussia believed it was entitled to control swaths of territory where there was a Russian cultural connection.\n\nInterim President Turchynov's claim that Russia was trying to provoke conflict found resonance a day later on \nMarch 1, 2014 when the Russian parliament voted unanimously to approve the use of military force \"in connection \nwith the extraordinary situation in Ukraine, the threat to the lives of citizens of the Russian Federation, our \ncompatriots\" and also to protect the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said his request \nfor authorization to use military action in Ukraine would endure \"until the normalization of the socio-political situation \nin that country.\"  Of concern was the fact that the authorization was for the use of force in Ukraine as a whole -- and \nnot just the flashpoint area of Crimea.\n\nIn response, Ukrainian  President Turchinov ordered troops to be placed on high combat alert, while the new \nforeign minister, Andriy Deshchytsya, said Ukraine had lodged a request with NATO to \"examine all possibilities to \nprotect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStill, the new government in Ukraine -- in that job for a week -- displayed remarkable restraint.  During a live \naddress that was broadcast nationally, President Turchynov urged Ukrainians of all backgrounds to stand united \nand not succumb to  provocations.  On the issue of provocation, the Ukrainian leader had already told contingents \nin Ukraine not to resist Russian armed operatives in Crimea.\n\nInternational Response:\n\nEuropean countries registered dismay at these developments in their backyard.  United Kingdom Foreign Secretary \nWilliam Hague expressed  \"deep concern\" over Russia's actions while Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt \ncharacterized Russia's actions as \"clearly against international law.\"\n\nCzech President Milos Zeman poignantly noted that the crisis in Ukraine was a disturbing reminder of the 1968 \nSoviet invasion of  Czechoslovakia in order to subdue the independence-minded Prague Spring movement.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama reportedly shared  a 60-minute telephone call with Russian President \nVladimir Putin in which he repeatedly accused Russia of violating international law and violating the sovereignty of \nUkraine.  Putin apparently told Obama that Russia reserved the right to protect its interests and  the interests of the \nRussian ethno-linguistic population in  Ukraine.  Stated differently, Putin was affirming his belief that Russia had the \nright to invade Ukraine on the basis of national interests.  As a point of clarification, these concerns by Russia could \n\n\n\ncertainly be addressed with the presence of  international monitors rather than via an uninvited intervention of \nRussian forces into Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, the fact of the matter was that the interim government of Ukraine had already offered assurances that \nminority (i.e. Russian) populations within Ukraine would be respected.\n\nFor its part, Ukraine was said to be \"mobilized for war,\" having called up its military reserves.  Arseny Yatseniuk -- \nnow at the helm of the interim  Ukrainian government in the position of acting prime minister -- declared that \nRussia's actions constituted \"the beginning of war and the end of any relations between Ukraine and Russia.\"  As \nregards the effective annexation of Crimea by Russia, Prime Minister Yatseniuk said:  \"This is not a threat: this is \nactually the declaration of war to my country.\"\n\nAt the international level United States Secretary of State John Kerry condemned Russia for its \"incredible act of \naggression\" saying in an interview with CBS News,  \"You don't just, in the 21st century, behave in 19th century \nfashion by invading another country on a completely trumped-up pretext.\"  Kerry also floated the possibility of \nsanctions against Russia and promised that Western countries would \"go to the hilt to isolate Russia.\"\n\nAlready, the United States had announced it would suspend participation in preparing for the G8 summit set to take \nplace in mid-2014 in Sochi, Russia.  The United States also made clear that it would consider having Russia \nremoved from the G8 grouping -- generally believed to be the political and economic leading nation states of the \nworld.  Canada soon joined the United States in suspending participation in preparatory meetings for the G8 summit \nand also recalling its ambassador to Russia.  The United Kingdom followed by becoming the third country to end its \nparticipation in preparatory meetings for the G8 summit.  It was to be seen if the remaining G8 nation states -- \nFrance, Germany, Italy, and Japan -- would be taking the same stance.\n\nRussia, however, was undeterred by these moves.  Indeed, its mission may have well been accomplished as it now \nhad a firm hold on Crimea and a foothold on Ukrainian territory.  Reports that the new head of the Ukrainian navy, \nRear Admiral Denis Berezovsky, had defected to Russian separatists in Crimea  on March 2, 2014, only augmented \nthat Russian foothold.  Although the Ukrainian government in Kiev immediately fired Berezovsky from his post and \ncharged him with treason, the damage was done.  Around the same time, the Kremlin in Russia was resolute as it \nasserted its right to intervene in Ukraine, charging that the country was  under threat from \"ultra-nationalists\" in the \naftermath of the ousting of Yanukovych from power.\n\nRussia's stance was publicly augmented by Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitali Churkin, who  \nsubmitted a letter to the United Nations Security Council, which was supposedly from ousted President \nYanukovych.  That letter cast Ukraine as on the precipice of a civil war and Russian speakers suffering harsh \npersecution -- a characterization denied by the new government of Ukraine.  Nevertheless, the letter from \nYanukovych called on Russia to intervene, and read as follows:  \"I would call on the president of Russia, Mr. Putin, \nasking him to use the armed forces of the Russian Federation to establish legitimacy, peace, law and order, stability \nand defending the people of Ukraine.\"  According to Churkin, since Yanukovych was Ukraine's legitimate leader, \nand not interim President Olexander Turchynov, Russia's actions in Ukraine were justified rather than a violation of \ninternational law, as charged by the West.\n\nUnited States ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, dismissed Russia's rationale, saying, \"Russian \nmobilization is a response to an imaginary threat.\" She continued, \"Military action cannot be justified on the basis of \nthreats that haven't been made and aren't being carried out.\"\n\nUnited Kingdom ambassador to the United Nations, Mark Lyall Grant, struck a similar note saying, \"It is clear that \nthese claims have simply been fabricated to justify Russian military action.\" Indeed, as noted above, there was no \nactual sign of persecution or intimidation of Ukraine's ethno-linguistically Russian population.  NATO  Secretary \nGeneral Anders Fogh Rasmussen joined the fray in condemning  Russia  for continuing to \"violate Ukraine's \n\n\n\nsovereignty and territorial integrity,\" and thus creating \"serious implications for the security and stability of the Euro-\nAtlantic area.\"\n\nClearly, the East-West division was hardening -- but at a time when Russian military forces were on the ground  in \nUkraine and in control of Crimea.\n\nAn anonymous Western official was cited by Reuters News as saying, \"This is probably the most dangerous \nsituation in Europe since the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968...  Realistically, we have to assume the \nCrimea is in Russian hands. The challenge now is to deter Russia from taking over the Russian-speaking east of \nUkraine.\" The Russian grip on Crimea was  confirmed on March 2, 2014, when United States officials noted that \nRussia had \"full operational control\" over the entirety of Crimea.\n\nLate on the night of  March 2, 2014,  a joint statement of the world's seven major industrialized powers expressed  \nharsh condemnation of Russia's invasion and apparent occupation of Crimea in the Ukraine.  The statement, which \nwas released from the Obama White House  in the United States, read as follows: \"We, the leaders of Canada, \nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the President of the European \nCouncil and President of the European Commission, join together today to condemn the Russian Federation's clear \nviolation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine...We have decided for the time being to suspend our \nparticipation in activities associated with the preparation of the scheduled G8 Summit in Sochi in June.\"  The G7 \nnations also offered de facto support for Ukraine by declaring that they were  ready \"to provide strong financial \nbacking to Ukraine.\"\n\nTo that end,  United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague had  departed  for Kiev for talks with the new \nUkrainian government for the purpose of  solidarity. United States Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Kiev  on \nMarch 4, 2014 to show support for the new  interim government of Ukraine, but also armed with a package of $1 \nbillion in loan guarantees for Ukraine and pledges of technical assistance for Ukraine's national bank and finance \nministry.  He also offered assistance in preparations for fresh elections.  While Kerry was in flight, the United States \nDepartment of State was in the process of putting together punitive sanctions against Russia.\n\nAs well, the European Union was considering its own sanctions,  including possible travel bans and targeted \neconomic measures, if Russia failed to \"de-escalate\" its threat of military force against Ukraine.  The European \nUnion was also floating the notion of paying Ukraine's bill to Russia for gas bills totaling $2 billion.  Collectively, the \neffort was aimed at ensuring that  Ukraine was positioned to withstand the reduction of energy subsidies from \nRussia, which was almost certain to occur in short order.\n\nIt was apparent that the diplomatic isolation -- however symbolic -- of Russia had begun. Of course, there was no \nsign that Russian President Putin was viewing the situation through the lens of economic pragmatism.  While the \nRussian ruble had plunged to an all-time low amidst the chaos, Putin was buoyed by the national support he was \ngetting from Russians at home for taking a hardline approach to Ukraine.  In fact, Putin continued to advance the \nview that Ukraine was embroiled in a state of chaos, having been taken over  by extremists, and that Russia was \nsimply doing its duty by protecting the Russian population.\n\nMaking the matter more perplexing was the Russian president's claim that the troops that seized control of Crimea \nwere not actually under Russian command, but simply inspired activists functioning organically in the face of \nUkrainian oppression.  Of course, the West reacted to this claim with utter disbelief and ridicule.\n\nFrom Kiev, United States Secretary of State Kerry deconstructed Putin's stance on Ukrainian oppression of Russian \nspeakers saying, \"I think that it is clear that Russia has been working hard to create a pretext for being able to \ninvade further. \" He continued, \"Russia has talked about Russian-speaking minority citizens who are under siege... \nThey're not.  It is not appropriate to invade a country and dictate what you want to achieve at the end of the barrel \n\n\n\nof a gun.\" Kerry also praised the new government of Ukraine, headed by  interim President  Turchynov, noting that \nhe had shown Herculean restraint in the face of provocation.\n\nLater on March 4, 2014, there were high level efforts being made at the diplomatic level in Paris between envoys \nfrom Russia, Ukraine, United States, United Kingdom, and France, to find a resolution to the Ukraine/Crimea crisis.  \nThose meetings ended without any progress being made.  United States Secretary of State Kerry tried to place a \npositive spin on his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as he said, \"Don't assume that we did not \nhave serious conversations which produced creative and appropriate ideas on how to resolve this, we have a \nnumber of ideas on the table.\"  Kerry  continued, \"I don't think any of us had an anticipation that we were coming \nhere at this moment, in this atmosphere of heightened tension and confrontation, that we were suddenly going to \nresolve that here, this afternoon.\"\n\nBut the truth was the Russia had defiantly ignored the West's calls for its forces to withdraw from Crimea and return \nto military barracks and bases.  As well, the Russian delegation refused to acknowledge -- far less meet with -- the \nUkrainian delegation.  Moreover,  Russian authorities were also advancing the erroneous notion that  an agreement \nwas reached with Western powers over returning to the European Union-brokered peace deal that was on the table \nprior to the ousting of Yanukovych.  The United States Department of State thus responded by denying that such a \ndeal existed, with an official saying: \"There were no agreements in this meeting, and there never will be without \ndirect Ukrainian government involvement and absolute buy-in.\"\n\nThe lack of progress, coupled with Russian defiance,  spurred NATO to announce from Brussels that it would \ncurtail  cooperation with Russia.  Instead,  NATO announced that it would intensify its engagement with the new \ngovernment of Ukraine.  As well, the United States also announced that it would double the number of fighter jets its \nfurnishes for NATO air patrol missions in the Baltic regions and increase air force training with Polish forces. \nFurthermore, the United States Pentagon was deploying a  Navy destroyer to the Black Sea.  These moves were \nsure to aggravate Russian authorities, who certainly did not wish to see a heavier American military footprint in their \nbackyard.  Once again, the underlying theme was ongoing East-West dissonance.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States, Canada,  and various European countries were moving forward with punitive actions \nagainst Russia.  President Barack Obama of the United States  delineated his first concrete punitive measures \nagainst Russia for \"threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" by freezing  the United States \nassets of Ukrainians deemed to have undermined the democratic process in Ukraine, and instituting a travel ban in \nthe form of visa restrictions on several Russian and Ukrainian officials.  Various European Union countries \nannounced they would also freeze the assets of Ukrainians  suspected of misappropriating state funds and human \nrights abuses; the list included ousted Ukrainian President Yanukovich, former Prime Minister Mykola Azarov. The \nEuropean Union also warned again that if Russia failed to de-escalate tensions, then the regional body was \nprepared to move forward with sanctions. French President Francois Hollande said,  \"There will be the strongest \npossible pressure on Russia to begin lowering the tension and in the pressure there is, of course, eventual recourse \nto sanctions.\"  Canada announced economic sanctions on  members of the ousted  government of Yanukovych.  \nAlready Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had recalled his ambassador from Russia.\n\nFlashpoints\n\nWhile at this point there was no bloodshed in the Ukrainian-Russian crisis, it should be noted that on March 5, \n2014, a United Nations special envoy -- Robert Serry of the Netherlands -- was detained in Russian-occupied \nCrimea outside the naval headquarters in Simferopol.  Serry was forced to depart the region without even having \nthe chance to collect his belongings.  United Nations  Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson expressed outrage \nover the incident, saying that Serry was \"seriously threatened.\"  As well, a  mission of  unarmed military observers \nfrom the pan-European Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was prevented from entering \nCrimea.\n\n\n\nAlso on March 5, 2014, Russia intensified its provocation of the Ukrainian/Crimean crisis by test-firing an \nintercontinental ballistic missile -- the  Topol RS-12M -- from Russia's Kapustin Yar test range near the Caspian \nSea in the direction of the Sary Shagan range in Kazakhstan.  The Russian defense forces said that the missile \nlaunch was intended to test the payload of the nuclear missile and went off successfully using a dummy warhead.  \nThe Russian armed forces also said  that the United States had been notified in advance of the missile test, in \nkeeping with prevailing bilateral arms treaties.  Still, the action only served to  heighten tensions further in the region \nwhere Cold War memories were being stirred at a furious rate.\n\nAnxiety over the future of Ukraine, and the fate of Crimea in particular, dramatically  increased on March 6, 2014, \nwhen Crimea's parliament voted unanimously to secede from Ukraine and \"to enter into the Russian Federation \nwith the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation.\"  A date for a referendum was set for mid-March 2014.  \nFollowing that referendum, whose outcome was almost certainly ratification, all state property would be \n\"nationalized\" and  the Russian ruble would be adopted. As well,  all Ukrainian troops in Crimea would be forced to \neither depart or surrender, or face captivity as foreign occupying forces.  The move served only to cast further \nturmoil into the cauldron of Crimea.\n\nWestern countries made it clear that they would not accept the outcome of the Crimean referendum, noting that it \nwould be in contravention to international law. For its part, Ukraine said that the referendum was illegal and warned \nthat Ukraine's armed forces was prepared to respond if Russian intervention escalated any further into Ukrainian \nterritory.\n\nOn March 8, 2014, the international stakes heightened when pro-Russian soldiers in Crimea fired warning shots at \na team of international observers from the Vienna-based OSCE.  Although there were no casualties in the incident, \nit showed continuing intransigence on the part of the pro-Russian forces  who asserted that the OSCE, which was \ninvited by the Ukrainian government, did not have its permission to enter Crimea.  As noted above, previous \nattempts made by the OSCE to enter Crimea were also met with resistance.\n\nA day later on March 9, 2014, pro-Ukrainian activists were attacked and beaten by pro-Russian and Cossack \ncabals during a rally in the Crimean city of Sevastapol.  The rally centered on the celebration of Taras Shevchenko, \na Ukrainian poet and national hero.  The pro-Russians and Cossacks attacked those attending the rally, \npresumably for their pro-Ukrainian inclinations.  The incident highlighted the irony of Russia's position in noting that \nits presence was needed in Crimea to \"protect\" the ethno-linguistic Russian population of the region.  Indeed, the \npersons needing protection In Crimea on this day were Ukrainians and pro-Ukrainians and not ethnic Russians.\n\nFor its part, Moscow dismissed the notion that it played any role in the escalating the Ukranian crisis, even rejecting \nthe notion that it sent troops into Crimea, and saying instead that it simply supported the local defense forces who \nhappen to be pro-Russia.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov even suggested that the Ukrainian crisis was \n\"artificially\" created by Kiev \"for purely geopolitical reasons.\"\n\nInternational Action (and Inaction)\n\nTogether, the events at the start of March 2014 likely strengthened the resolve of the West to enact further \nmeasures against Moscow for failing to defuse the crisis.  To that end, the United States announced that it would be \nwelcoming interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk  to Washington for talks on how to end turmoil \nrocking Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, the  countries of Europe along with the United States emphasized its views of  Russia's action as \naggression against Ukraine and again warned that any active annexation of Crimea would end the diplomatic track.  \nThe West also reminded Russia and pro-Russian entities controlling Crimea that most of the world would not \nrecognize the results of the illegal referendum in Crimea.  The European Union on March 12, 2014, also agreed on \na framework for sanctions against Russia. The sanctions would mirror United States measures, as they would \ninclude travel bans and asset freezes.\n\n\n\nAs well, NATO determined that it would cease cooperation with Russia, while deploying  reconnaissance planes in \nPoland and Romania to monitor the Ukrainian crisis.  This measure by NATO was sure to annoy Russia, which has \nlong eschewed the presence of Western powers in eastern Europe, which it considers to be its own \"backyard.\"\n\nDespite these moves, the fact of the matter was that NATO has not been eager to enter into the Ukrainian/Crimean \ncrisis.  It has tred lightly into this landscape, noting that because Ukraine was not a NATO member state, there was \nno actual obligation to protect it.  However, Ukrainian acting Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk has noted that under \na 1994 disarmament treaty,  known as the Budapest Memorandum,  Ukraine agreed to give up its Soviet nuclear \nweapons  in return for assistance from  Russia and the West in defending Ukraine's sovereignty.  He posed the \nfollowing question: \"What does the current military aggression of the Russian Federation on Ukrainian territory \nmean?\" He then continued, \"It means that a country which voluntarily gave up nuclear weapons, rejected nuclear \nstatus and received guarantees from the world's leading countries is left defenseless and alone in the face of a \nnuclear state that is armed to the teeth.\n\nIn truth, the United States and the European Union were more likely to offer financial aid and public declaration of \nsolidarity than military support to an encroaching Russia, which was quite likely to officially annex Crimea following \nthe ratification of Russian unity on March 16, 2014.  But that move would inevitably highlight the fact that European \ncountries unfortunate enough to be on Russia's radar could also be subject to annexation while facing no serious \nconsequence for violating the modern international order, which it founded on the notion of sovereignty.\n\nTensions were on the rise in Crimea in the second week of March 2014 as troops believed to be Russian, in \nconjunction with local militias, seized control of a military hospital in  the regional capital Simferopol.  As well, pro-\nRussian  armed troops, described as \"self defense forces,\" blockaded Ukrainian troops from entering Crimea, even \nas Russia itself denied that it was participating in such blockades.\n\nTensions were on the rise elsewhere in eastern Ukraine as pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian activists clashed in the \ncities of Kharkiv and Donetsk, where at least one person was killed.\n\nSensing that the scene was taking a dark turn, Ukraine's interim President Oleksander Turchinov had established a \nnew National Guard and called on the international community for assistance in dealing with what it cast as Russian \naggression.\n\nActing Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk  vociferously blamed Russia for the current crisis, and for actively \nundermining the global security structure as he declared, \"This is not a two-sided conflict. These are actions by the \nRussian Federation aimed at undermining the system of global security.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama promised to \"stand with Ukraine\" and chastised Russia saying, \"It is \nabsolutely unacceptable to have Russian boots on the Ukrainian ground in the 21st century, violating all \ninternational deals and treaties.\"  President Obama also warned his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, \nthat the international community would  be forced \"to apply costs\" if Russia did not remove its troops from Crimea.\n\nHowever, the actual value of those costs was a matter of debate.  Given Russia's reserves, the combination of \ntravel bans, asset freezes,  and sanctions were unlikely to do much damage to a country more intent on \nreconstituting its Soviet domain.\n\nThat being said, President Obama was not alone.  The leaders of most of the world's leading industrialized \ncountries -- the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan -- issued similar stances in \nrepudiation of Russia's actions in Crimea and in solidarity with Ukraine.\n\nA statement from  the leaders of the G7 nation states -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, \nItaly, Canada, and Japan -- demanded that the referendum not go forward, That statement included the following \n\n\n\ndeclaration: \"In addition to its impact on the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the annexation of \nCrimea could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states.\"  \nWarning Russia of consequences, the statement continued, \"Should the Russian Federation take such a step, we \nwill take further action, individually and collectively.\"\n\nFar from being chastened by such promises of condemnation at the international level, Russia appeared to suggest \nthere was a need for increased -- rather than decreased -- involvement in Ukrainian affairs.  Signaling even further \nencroachment into Ukrainian territory, Russia expressed \"deep concern\" over the activities of \"nationalists\" in \neastern Ukraine  and the need to provide security in that country against a backdrop of \"radicals.\n\nIt was to be seen how Russia would explain its incursion into Ukrainian territory and its audacious seizure of a gas \nplant in  the eastern part of the country as being a measure of \"protection\" against radicals. Indeed, on March 15, \n2014, approximately 80 Russian troops landed by helicopter in Ukrainian territory and seized control over  a natural \ngas terminal.  Ukraine responded by stationing its own troops outside the facility and issuing a statement that read \nas follows: \"Ukraine reserves the right to use all necessary measures to stop the military invasion by Russia.\"\n\nOne glimmer of hope emerged in the form of a temporary truce over the blockade of  Ukrainian military units in \nCrimea; on March 21, 2014, that blockade was scheduled to be lifted.\n\nMeanwhile, the West attempted to condemn Crimea's secession referendum, and issue its support for Ukraine's \nsovereignty,  by moving forward with a resolution in the United Nations Security Council.  As expected, Russia -- as \na veto-wielding permanent member -- vetoed the draft.  Every other Security Council member voted in favor of the \nmeasure, with the exception of China, which abstained from the vote.  Normally, China has joined Russia in \ncontroversial votes at the Security Council, such as action on the Syrian civil war.  But in this case, with territories \nsuch as Tibet in mind,  China was seemingly interested in delivering the message of its pro-sovereignty/non-\ninterventionist stance.\n\nThe inaction at the Security Council was reminiscent of the Cold war era in which both sides habitually vetoed the \nother's measures, essentially creating a state of diplomatic paralysis.\n\nThe United States ambassador to the United Nations,  Samantha Power, characterized Russia's veto of the \nmeasure as a \"sad and remarkable moment\" and cast Russia as \"isolated, alone and wrong.\"  Undaunted, Russia's \nambassador to the United Nations,  Vitaly Churkin, asserted that Crimea's  referendum was needed to fill the \"legal \nvacuum\" in the aftermath of Ukraine's \"coup d'etat.\"\n\nWith Crimea's referendum only days away, there were last minute talks between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov \nand United States Secretary of State Kerry to find a negotiated settlement.  That meeting ended in failure with \nLavrov declaring that Kerry's package of solutions were \"not suitable: because  they take \"the situation created by \nthe coup as a starting point.\"  Because Russia viewed the overthrow of Yanukovych as illegal, it was not swayed by \nthe arguments of the West.  Clearly, an impasse was at hand.\n\nCrimea votes for secession from Ukraine and unity with Russia\n\nOn the eve of the referendum in Crimea, the United States and the European Union repeated  their threats to slap \nfurther sanctions on Russia, and warned that the ratification (i.e. an affirmative vote to unite with Russia)  would not \nbe internationally recognized.\n\nNevertheless, on March  16, 2014, voters went to the polls in Crimea to participate in a hastily organized \nreferendum aimed at ratifying its breakaway from Ukraine and its union with Russia.  The move was largely viewed \nas an illegal move that contravened against international law, and as discussed above, it was guaranteed to be \nrejected by most countries of the world.\n\n\n\nThe referendum itself was being regarded as something of a sham as no international monitors were present to \nwitness the event, while accredited journalists were required to pledge not to report \"negative news.\"  Meanwhile,  \nwith the region's original but minority Tartar population boycotting the vote, the outcome was almost guaranteed to \nbe ratification of a proposed  union with Russia.\n\nIndeed, once the votes were counted, as many as 95 percent of voters in Crimea had backed secession from \nUkraine and unity with Russia.  Celebratory crowds  were on the streets rejoicing the move to join with Russia, with \nmany people expressing the view that they would now be \"protected\" by Russia.  Sergey Aksyonov, the \nbusinessman who actually won only five percent in the Crimean assembly in the previous elections but who \ninstalled himself as Crimea's regional leader following Russia's de facto takeover of Crimea was also celebrating \nthe vote in favor of unity with Russia.  He also insisted that  the vote was free and fair, irrespective of the fact that \nthere were no monitors and a prevailing boycott by the Tartar population.\n\nOn March 17, 2014, one day after Crimea voted to join Russia, the United States and the European Union imposed  \npersonal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials believed to be involved in the annexation of Crimea.  This \npunitive action was intended as a rebuke against the illegal vote.  But these moves were being regarded as \ninsignificant by Russia, which some officials making sport of them via social media.\n\nFor its part, Crimea officially requested that the \"Republic of Crimea\" be admitted as a new subject to the Russian \nFederation.\n\nOn the Russian side of the equation, Russia recognized Crimea as a sovereign entity.  Russian President Putin was \nset to address the Russian parliament at which time, presumably, he would make clear whether or not his country \nintended to officially annex Crimea.  Finally, Ukraine insisted that it would not accept these moves by Crimea and \nRussia, and that its sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected.\n\nUnited Kingdom  Prime Minister David Cameron urged the European Union to send \"a very clear warning\" to \nRussia, and suggested that Russia be permanently expelled from the G8 group.  As well, United States Vice \nPresident Joe Biden, on a trip to Europe, warned Russia that it was on  a \"dark path\" to isolation.  Vice President \nBiden asserted, \"As long as Russia continues on this dark path, they will face increasing political and economic \nisolation.\" During a session of the United Nations Security Council, United States Ambassador Samantha Power \ndeclared, \"Russia it seems has re-written its borders but it cannot rewrite the facts.\"  Likewise, NATO condemned \nRussia for attempting to \"redraw the map of Europe.\"\n\nBut the admonishments and warnings from the United States, the United Kingdom,  and NATO  fell on deaf ears.  \nIndeed, around the same time,  Russian troops consolidated their hold on Crimea by seizing\n\nUkrainian naval bases in Crimea,  including the headquarters in Sevastopol where the Russian flag was raised. As \npro-Russian forced took control of the Ukrainian naval headquarters in Sevastopol, they also managed to capture  \nthe commander of the Ukrainian navy, Admiral Serhiy Haiduk, along with several others. Haiduk was only released \nafter Russian authorities in Moscow intervened.\n\nRussia formally annexes Crimea\n\nOn March 19, 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin -- in defiance of international condemnation and  Western \nsanctions,  signed a treaty making Crimea part Russia.  President Putin delivered a triumphant address to the \nRussian  parliament in the Kremlin celebrating the return of Crimea to the Russian fold.  Side-stepping the reality \nthat the Crimea referendum had been held under Russian occupation, and with nary a word for Crimea's ethnic \nTartars, Putin said the referendum result showed the will of the Crimean people to reunite with the Russian \nhomeland.  He said, \"The hearts and minds of people, Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of \nRussia.\"\n\n\n\nPutin also excoriated the West for its hypocrisy, pointing to the fact that many of those Western countries had \nsupported the independence bid of Kosovo (home to a predominantly ethnic Albanian population) from Serbia (an \nethnically Slavic nation state).  Putin claimed that the West now wanted to deny Crimea the same right to follow its \nown identity-driven path.  To raucous applause in the Kremlin, Putin declared: \"You cannot call the same thing \nblack today and white tomorrow.\"  He also had harsh words for Ukraine's new government, casting them as \"neo-\nNazis, Russophobes, and anti-Semites.\"\n\nPutin had a message for Ukraine, suggesting that Russian aggression against that country had now ended and \nthere was no reason to fear a Russian push further into Ukrainian territory.  He said, \"Don't believe those who try to \nfrighten you with Russia and who scream that other regions will follow after Crimea...We do not want a partition of \nUkraine. We do not need this.\"\n\nFor its part, Ukraine seemed to accept the reality that it had lost Crimea.  Ukrainian authorities announced that they \nwould be withdrawing soldiers and their families from Crimea in an orderly manner.  As well, Ukraine with its far less \nsuperior military sought to lessen the prospects of further Russian encroachment by stating that it had no intention \nof joining NATO and vowing to disarm nationalist militias.\n\nPerhaps these assurances and the plan for withdrawal were driven by the fact that the first death associated with \nthe crisis had been a Ukrainian soldier who died when his base came under attack  by Russian forces in the \nCrimean town of Simferopol. Although Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk cast the death of the soldier as a \n\"war crime,\" and even as President Oleksander Turchinov instructed Ukrainian troops in Crimea \"to use weapons to \ndefend and protect the lives of Ukrainian servicemen,\"  the fact of the matter was that the losses of life and territory \nwere being experienced on the Ukrainian side of the equation.\n\nIndeed, one could argue that  Russia had effectively \"won\" this round of confrontations, by seizing Crimea from that \ncountry and by not having to pay a price for the violation of sovereignty.  Russia was gaining even further rewards \nwith these aforementioned assurances from Ukraine.\n\nNote that on March 21,  2014, having secured parliamentary support for the move, Russian President Vladimir Putin \nformally signed into law the annexation of Crimea.\n\nUkraine Moving Forward\n\nRegardless of its effective loss of Crimea, Ukraine was moving forward with its pro-European stance and signed an \nassociation agreement with the European Union on March 21, 2014. European Union President Herman Van \nRompuy  hailed the agreement, saying, \"Today, we are signing the [association] agreement's political provisions. It \nshows our steadfast support for the course the people of Ukraine have courageously pursued. Today is but the \nopening act. We expect to soon sign the agreement's remaining parts, not least the economic provisions. Together \nwith the political ones, they form a single instrument.\"\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk celebrated the signing of the agreement, saying, \"This deal covers the \nmost existential and most important issues, mainly security and defense cooperation. This deal will establish a joint \ndecision-making body, which is to facilitate the process of real reforms in my country. And this deal meets the \naspirations of millions of Ukrainians that want to be a part of the European Union.\" Underlining Europe's \ncommitment to Ukraine was the statement by the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, \nwho asserted: \"This is the democratic choice that Ukraine has made. It is our firm intention to sign the remaining \nparts of the agreement in due course. Europe is committed to Ukraine for the long term.\"\n\nOf course, that association agreement was the very foundation of the unrest in Ukraine in late 2013 through 2014, \nthat ended in the ousting of Yanukovych, and ultimately spurred Russian encroachment into Crimea.  To that latter \n\n\n\nend, on the same day as Ukraine signed the Association Agreement with the European Union, having secured \nparliamentary support for the move, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally signed into law the annexation of \nCrimea.\n\nMeanwhile, at the political level, opposition figure, Klitscho, who played a central role in the protests of 2013 and \n2014 in Ukraine announced that he would not be pursuing the presidency.  Instead, he said that he intended to run \nfor the post of mayor of Kiev and placed his support for the presidential contest behind businessman Petro \nPoroshenko, who also was a central player in Ukraine's anti-Russian/pro-European uprising.  It was to be seen if \nthe consolidation of support around Poroshenko would stave off victory by Tymoshenko, who also  announced her \nbid for the presidency.  Now released from prison under the presidency of Yanukovych for largely political reasons, \nit was to be seen if Tymoshenko -- still, a polarizing figure -- could secure the most painful revenge against ousted \nYanukovych by winning the post he held only a few months prior.\n\nIs Russia setting its sight on the Moldovan territory of Trans-Dniestr?\n\nAs March 2014 entered its final week, and as Russia had its foot firmly implanted in Crimea, anxieties about \nRussian territorial ambitions were sparked again -- but this time on the former Soviet republic of Moldova.  At issue \nwas the  disputed territory of Trans-Dniestr which resides under the jurisdiction of Moldova while harboring  \nseparatist ambitions.\n\nShortly after Moldova declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Trans-Dniestr declared its \nindependence from Moldova, sparking an armed conflict between Moldovan and Trans-Dniestrian forces.  The \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has remained involved in negotiations over Trans-\nDniestr's status since the conflict began, though a long series of negotiations have thus far failed to produce a final \nstatus agreement. Moldova has tried to accommodate its ethnn-linguistic Russian minority in the region by offering \nbroad cultural and political autonomy.  But given Russia's success in Crimea, it was to be seen if the Russian \nargument that it must act to \"protect\" ethno-linguistic Russians would hold sway in Moldova. The Russia argument \nin that direction would be aided by the call from the speaker of Trans-Dniestr's parliament for Russia to incorporate \nthe region.\n\nThe attention of Trans-Dniestr emerged in late March 2014 as speculation arose about Russia using its many \npolitical and economic levers to prevent Moldova from moving forward with its Western integration effort.  At the top \nof Russia's list of objectives was likely to be the derailment of Moldova's proposed association and trade \nagreements with the European Union. Moldova completed the initial rounds of signatures in late 2013 during a \nsummit in Vilnius (Lithuania)  -- the same meeting at which former Ukrainian President Yanukovych rejected the \ndeals. With Moldova set to sign on to the association agreement officially in mid-2014, it was to be seen if Russia \nwould leverage its power to prevent that from occurring.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 25, 2014, Russia held military exercises in  Trans-Dniestr. NATO's Supreme Allied \nCommander Europe, United States Air Force General Philip Breedlove has noted that Russia had  built up a \"very \nsizeable\" force on its border with Ukraine, that could easily be activated elsewhere in the region.  Chief among the \npossibilities for expanded Russian encroachment, according to Breedlove, was the Moldovan territory of Trans-\nDniestr.  In his remarks to the Marshall Fund think tank, Breedlove said, \"There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) \nforce postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Trans-Dniestr if the decision was made to do that, and that \nis very worrisome.\"  Breedlove thus added, \"We need to think about our allies, the positioning of our forces in the \nalliance and the readiness of those forces ... such that we can be there to defend against it if required.\"\n\nOf course, given the lack of international action -- including on the part of NATO -- in punishing Russia for seizing \nCrimea, it was barely conceivable that NATO would act to save Moldova's territorial integrity, should Russia choose \nto incorporate Trans-Dniestr.  To date, Russia has paid no price for its action in the Russian-speaking regions of \nSouth Ossetia and Abkhazia, which remain officially under Georgian jurisdiction.  As well, sanctions and \n\n\n\ncondemnations against Russia for annexing Crimea has resulted in only mocking responses from the Russian \npolitical class.\n\nUN General Assembly declares Crimean independence referendum to be invalid:\n\nOn March 27, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution declaring Crimea's \nindependence referendum, and its associated secession from Ukraine,  to be invalid. The approved declaration \ndismissed the vote in Crimea as \"having no validity\" and noted that it \"cannot form the basis for any alteration of the \nstatus of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the City of Sevastopol.\"  The resolution further stated that the \nUnited Nations General Assembly \"calls upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to \nrecognize any alteration of the status\" of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\nThere were 100 votes in favor, 11 votes against it, 58 abstentions, while 24 countries did not participate at all.  The \ncountries of the West wasted little time in noting that the overwhelming vote at the General Assembly to invalidate \nthe Crimean  independence referendum showed Russia's global isolation. Indeed, with only 10 countries willing to \nofficially place themselves on the record as being in Moscow's corner,  the vote in the United Nations General \nAssembly was a rebuke of sorts.  That short list included certain \"rogue\" nations such as North Korea, Sudan, and \nSyria, along with countries not known for their democratic records, such as Cuba, Venezuela, Belarus, and \nZimbabwe.  Indeed, the vote outcome was illustrative of  the fact that Russia held waning influence on the global \nstage.\n\nThe Russian ambassador to the United Nations  Churkin, seemed unwilling to accept the condemnation by the \nglobal community,  saying instead, \"Historical justice has been vindicated.\"  He also took comfort in the 58 \nabstentions, which included China, saying that they implied tacit support for Russia.  In truth, however, there were \nreports of countries being bullied by Russia into abstentions. In particular, several  Eastern European and Central \nAsian states were threatened with retaliation if they voted in favor of the resolution declaring invalid Crimea's \nreferendum on seceding from Ukraine. Reuters News reported that in interviews with United Nations diplomats, \nmany of the countries targeted with political and economic threats by Russia included Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and \nTajikistan.  Given the geopolitical and geostrategic stakes, it was not surprising that Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan \nopted not to cast a vote at all.\n\nThe West was meanwhile making the most of the strong \"yes vote.\"  French Ambassador Gerard Araud declared: \n\"When you lose, you have to be a good a loser...I think Russia is a bad loser. They lost and they did by 100 votes.\"\n\nTwo days before the vote in the United Nations General Assembly, United States President Barack Obama was \nhimself employing strong language to diminish Russia's standing in the world.  During a  joint news  conference with \nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, President Obama dismissed Russia as simply a \"regional power,\" which was \nthreatening its neighbors out of a position of weakness rather than strength.  President Obama added that his \ncountry, the United States, had no need to invade any of its immediate neighbors to maintain its influence on them \nor force a cooperative relationship.  The following day, speaking from Belgium, President Obama emphasized his \nperception that Russia was a waning influence -- no longer a super power on the world stage -- and thus the conflict \nover Ukraine did not constitute the beginning of another Cold War.  President Obama relentlessly noted that Russia \ndid  not lead a bloc of nations, and did not possess a global ideology that a large number of other countries wished \nto follow or emulate.\n\nDespite the edgy rhetoric, the diplomatic track continued to move forward with United States  Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry holding meetings with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on March 30, 2014.  \nThose talks were characterized as \"frank\" but ended without any agreement on Ukraine being forged.  Russia was \nreportedly making demands that Ukraine by a neutral and federal entity while the United States advocated for \nUkraine to be at the table where its own future was being discussed. As noted by Secretary of State Kerry, \"This \nprinciple is clear: no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"  Kerry also expressed \"strong concerns\" about the \npresence of Russian troops on the Ukraine border, while Lavrov insisted that Russia had not plan for an invasion of \n\n\n\nUkraine.  For its part, the Ukrainian foreign ministry cast Lavrov's demands for a future federal system of \ngovernment in Ukraine as \"patronizing.\" Clearly, the diplomatic track had a lengthy distance to be traversed.\n\nNATO suspends cooperation with Russia while looking towards military exercises with Ukraine:\n\nA further blow to Russia's standing internationally came via the news that NATO would be suspending \"all practical \ncivilian and military cooperation\" with that country.  NATO foreign ministers made the decision at a meeting in the \nBelgian capital of Brussels on April 1, 2014, saying it was in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nNATO, however, said it would continue with some degree of political dialogue with  Moscow through the NATO-\nRussia Council, and it would continue to work with Russia on counter-narcotics efforts.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, \"I would expect the [NATO-Russian] counter-narcotics \nproject to continue. It also involves other countries than Russia and I think Russia has a very strong interest in \ncontinuing our strong efforts in countering drugs trafficking. I would also expect the Afghanistan-related cooperation \nprojects to continue -- the [troop] transit arrangement as well as the helicopter projects.\"\n\nSecretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen also noted that while NATO would be prepared to assist Ukraine in its \neffort to ameliorate its military, it would not be in a position to provide Ukraine  with weapons since all military \nequipment was actually owned by NATO member states.  Any arms assistance to Ukraine would have to be \nrendered via \"bilateral arrangements between NATO allies and their partners.\"\n\nNevertheless, NATO announced that it would  intensify cooperation with Ukraine through military training.  To this \nend, Ukraine's parliament approved conducting military exercises with NATO countries later in 2014.  NATO would \nadditionally consider the deployment of military assets in eastern European NATO countries, such as the Baltic \nstates and Poland, which in the post-Soviet era have consistently been eager to move out of Moscow's orbit and \nwere now disturbed by Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\nFor its part, Russia continued its campaign of intimidation against Ukraine as it warned that country not to consider \naccession to NATO.  Russia  also threated Ukraine's economic fortune by saying future economic ties would \ndepend on Ukraine's foreign policy decisions.  Russia's state-controlled gas company, Gazprom, underlined that \nthreat by increasing the price of gas for Ukraine by 40 percent.\n\nEastern Ukraine is new Flashpoint in Crisis\n\nIn the first week of April 2014, eastern Ukraine emerged as a new flashpoint with pro-Russian cabals taking control \nover government buildings in cities such as  Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv. These pro-Russian separatists were \nurging Russia and  President Vladimir Putin to intervene, even calling for  a Crimea-style referendum in which they \ncould unite with Russia. The government of Ukraine was in no mood to entertain such notions and, instead, made \nclear it would restore order forcibly if necessary.\n\nWith an eye on a some sort of resolution, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said, \"A resolution to this crisis will be \nfound within the next 48 hours.\"  He continued, \"For those who want dialogue, we propose talks and a political \nsolution.\"  But Avakov also issued a warning as he said, \"For the minority who want conflict they will get a forceful \nanswer from the Ukrainian authorities.\"\n\nThe Obama administration in the United States accused Russia of being behind the effort to destabilize and \nultimately fragment Ukraine. Indeed, United States Secretary of State John Kerry went so far as to accuse Russian \nagents  of fomenting the separatist sentiment and turmoil in eastern Ukraine, with the goal of ultimately justifying \nmilitary action further into Ukrainian territory.  He said, \"It is clear that Russian special forces and agents have been \nthe catalyst behind the chaos of the last 24 hours.\"\n\n\n\nThe United Kingdom also joined the chorus with Foreign Secretary William Hague saying that the mass protests \nand occupation of government interests in eastern Ukraine bore \"all the hallmarks of a Russian strategy to \ndestabilize Ukraine.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk cast the developments as follows: \"An anti-Ukrainian plan is \nbeing put into operation ... under which foreign troops will cross the border and seize the territory of the country.\" \nHe went on, \"We will not allow this.\"\n\nThese claims were not, in actuality, farfetched since it was this very mode of operation that led to the referendum in \nCrimea, and ultimately, its annexation by Russia, as discussed above. In fact, in the second week of April 2014, \nAnders Fogh Rasmussen -- the head of NATO -- echoed the view that the unrest in eastern Ukraine was \nreminiscent of what had transpired in Crimea and placed the blame on Russia.  Rasmussen made note of the \n\"reappearance of men with specialized Russian weapons and identical uniforms without insignia, as previously \nworn by Russian troops during Russia's illegal and illegitimate seizure of Crimea.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry went further, noting that the uprisings in eastern Ukraine \"could \npotentially be a contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia dismissed the accusations, insisting that any uprising in eastern Ukraine was merely a natural \ndevelopment on the  political scene.  Left unmentioned was the fact that Russia was maintaining its buildup of \nmilitary forces on the border with Ukraine. In an interview with ABC News,  Samantha Power, the United States \nambassador to the United Nations, rejected Russia's claim that unrest in eastern Ukraine was an organic \noccurrence.  Pointing to the systematic manner in which pro-Russian militants were able to take control of \ngovernment interests in Ukraine, she said, \"It's professional, co-ordinated. Nothing grassroots about it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, plans were afoot for a meeting that would include representatives from Russia, Ukraine, the United \nStates and the European Union.  On the agenda was a negotiated resolution to the Ukrainian crisis, although the \nactual feasibility of such an agreement was a matter of debate.  According to United States diplomat, Victoria \nNuland, there were no high hopes for a resolution being forged; however, she expressed the view that it was \nimportant to keep the \"diplomatic door open.\"\n\nBut by mid-April 2014, the diplomatic door appeared to be closing. Pro-Russian forces were holding sway over an \nincreasing number of government buildings, and the unrest was spreading to other eastern Ukrainian cities, such as \nSloviansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka.\n\nOutraged over what they perceived as Russian intervention into Ukrainian affairs, by backing pro-Russian mobs in \neastern Ukraine, Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov drew a symbolic line in the sand and declared that a \nmilitary operation would be launched to oust the pro-Russian cabals.\n\nIn a national address that was broadcast in the media, Acting President  Turchynov  warned that the government of \nUkraine would not allow pro-Russian forces to repeat what was done in Crimea, and which ultimately ended with \nthe annexation of that region by Russia.  Referring to Russia directly as the source of unrest in eastern Ukraine, the \npresident said: \"The aggressor... is continuing to sow disorder in the east of the country.\"  He continued, \"We will \nnot allow Russia to repeat the Crimean scenario in the eastern regions of Ukraine.\"  Unwilling to cede any further \nUkrainian territory to Russia, Acting President  Turchynov thus issued a decree demanding that pro-Russian \nmilitants relinquish their weapons and vacate government buildings  in eastern Ukrainian flashpoint cities, or, face a \nfull-scale military assault.\n\nPresumably alarmed by this news, Russia accused Ukraine of \"waging war against its own people\" and demanded \nan emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council. At that emergency meeting on April 12, 2014,  \nRussia called for dialogue with Ukraine,  while its ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, demanded that \n\n\n\n\"the henchmen of Maidan\" -- a reference to Ukraine's protest movement --  \"stop attacking their own people.\" He \nalso  warned that  neo-Nazis and anti-Semites were now sitting in \"the self-proclaimed government in Kiev.\"\n\nFor its part, Ukraine reiterated its accusation that Russia had orchestrated the crisis unfolding in eastern Ukraine,  \nwhile  Russia denied the allegations that its agents were responsible for fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the Ukrainian promise of an \"anti-terrorism\" operation to come in eastern Ukraine if pro-Russian \ncabals did not withdraw from government buildings, and in defiance of a deadline for action imposed by the \nUkrainian government, pro-Russian militants expanded their control into other towns.\n\nOf note was the storming and occupation of a police station in the town of Horlivka, close to  Donetsk.  In  Donetsk \nitself, pro-Russian militants said they intended to seize control of the local government infrastructure there and \ndeclare themselves to be an independent \"People's Republic of Donetsk.\"\n\nIn Slaviansk, where the Ukrainian government said it would begin its \"anti-terrorism\" operation, pro-Russian \nmilitants held Russian flags, shouted \"Russia! Russia!\"  and made it clear they retained control of the city council \noffices. They even placed Ukrainian troops on a bus and sent them back to  their base at Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nIn the city of Kramatorsk, where Ukrainian forces were supposed to be regaining control, the effort was curtailed.  \nSoon after Ukrainian forces recaptured an airfield, pro-Russian militants  seized and disarmed Ukrainian military \nvehicles.\n\nThe humiliation of Ukrainian authorities at the hands of pro-Russian forces continued in Pchyolkino, where again \nUkrainian military vehicles were subdued by pro-Russian forces.  In some cases in the eastern part of the country, \nUkrainian forces quite literally surrendered to pro-Russian militants.\n\nIt was apparent that the so-called \"anti-terrorism\" operation was, if not a humiliating failure for the Ukrainian \nauthorities, then certainly an embarrassing illumination of Kiev's weakness in confronting Moscow's aggression.\n\nAmidst criticism of the Ukrainian authorities' ineffectual response to the Russian threat,  Vitaly Tsyhanok, the head \nof Ukraine's anti-terror operations, was sacked from his post.  Those criticisms included the question as to why the \ngovernment had not yet declared a state of emergency over the crisis in the eastern part of the country.  In \nresponse, the government said it had  not yet taken that action since it would require the suspension of the \npresidential election set for May 25, 2014, which was a priority for the political stabilization of the country.\n\nWhile Ukrainian interim President Turchynov  railed against the apparent encroachment by Russia again into \nUkrainian territory, he nonetheless suggested he was open to the idea of transforming Ukraine from a republic to a \nfederation, effectively conveying greater autonomy on the Russian-speaking eastern part of the country.  To this \nend, he said he would support the notion of a national referendum on the matter.  Of course, ratification was not \nguaranteed since western Ukraine was supportive of a fully unified republic.  Clearly, Turchynov was banking on the \npro-republic/anti-federation vote winning the day.  The president mentioned this reality as he said, \"We are not \nagainst holding a national referendum... I am certain that a majority of Ukrainians will support an indivisible, \nindependent, democratic and united Ukraine.\"\n\nDeepening the crisis was the news in the early hours of April 17, 2014, that pro-Russian separatists attacked a \nnational guard base in Mariupol on the Sea of Azov; three of them were killed in the ensuing fracas with Ukrainian \nforces.\n\nAdding even further  to the sense of chaos and turmoil were disturbing reports that members of the Jewish \ncommunity in eastern Ukraine were being targeted.  At issue was the release of leaflets in the  city of Donetsk \ninstructing Jews  to \"register\" with the new authorities or face deportation and having their citizenship revoked.  It \n\n\n\nshould be noted that the self-appointed authorities in Donetsk distanced themselves from the leaflets and made it \nknown that it was not their work.  Still, the fact of the matter was that such leaflets did exist and were circulated in \nthe city.  The irony in this alarming event was the fact that Russia had long accused Kiev of repressing the Russian-\nspeaking population of Ukraine. In fact, this case showed that other minorities were being subject to repression by \nthe Russian ethno-linguistic population of eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith the United States and NATO making it clear they had no intention of involving themselves in the burgeoning \nUkrainian civil war, and with the European Union unlikely to support such a course of action on its doorstep, there \nwere few quivers in the arsenal of the West against Russia.  Instead, further economic sanctions and a symbolic \nshow of force were in the offing.\n\nThe United Kingdom had already called for the imposition of further sanctions by the European Union against \nRussia as a result of its actions in the ever-escalating Ukrainian crisis.  With the scenario in Ukraine devolving \nfurther, foreign ministers from the European Union agreed to expand their sanctions against Russia, while the \nObama administration in the United States said it was exploring means to impose more painful \"costs\" on Russia.  \nThe United States also said it was approving non-lethal aid for Ukraine.\n\nOn the military end of things,  NATO announced it would reinforce the security of alliance member states.  NATO \nSecretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen  said, \"You will see deployments at sea, in the air, on land, to take \nplace immediately. That means within days.\"  Of course, the truth was that the action was not in NATO member \nstates but in vulnerable Ukraine, which had the rhetoric -- but not practical -- support of the West in its fight against \nRussian territorial ambitions.\n\nIt was to be seen if peace conference set to convene on April 17, 2014, in Geneva  between representatives of \nUkraine, Russia, the United States, and the European Union would actually yield results.  Going into the meeting, \nthere was no sense of optimism.  Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said he had limited expectations and \nadded, \"I don't trust the Russian side.\"\n\nThat sense of trust was not likely helped by the leader of Russia on the eve of the peace conference. Indeed, \nPresident Putin did little to rhetorically calm the situation. While paying lip service to his preference for diplomacy, \nPutin insisted that Russia had the right to militarily intervene in neighboring countries.  He said, \"The Federation \nCouncil granted the president the right to use military force in Ukraine. I really hope that I do not have to exercise \nthis right and that we are able to solve all today's pressing issues via political and diplomatic means.\"  He \ncontinued, \"We must do everything to help these people (in eastern Ukraine) defend their rights and independently \ndetermine their own destiny.\"  Putin set off alarm bells across the region as he intimated that such Russian help \nwould not stop with Ukraine but extend elsewhere in the region. To this end, Putin looked to  Trans-Dniestr and said \nthat the people of that Moldovan separatist enclave should also be permitted to \"determine their own destiny.\"  \nPutin also  had sharp words for the new Ukrainian government, which he accused of dragging that country into an \nabyss.  He said, \"I hope that they are able to realize what a pit, what an abyss the current authorities are in and \ndragging the country into.\"\n\nAgreement forged to end Ukraine Crisis\n\nDespite the low expectations regarding the potential success of that meeting, the hard work of diplomacy  won the \nday on April 17, 2014, when an agreement was reached to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine.  The agreement was \nforged between United States Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, European \nUnion foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, as well as acting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia.\n\nThe four joint parties in Geneva released a statement announcing the agreement as follows: \"The Geneva meeting \non the situation in Ukraine agreed on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all \ncitizens.\"\n\n\n\nCentral to the Geneva agreement  were the following elements --\n\n- all illegal militant groups in Ukraine should be dissolved immediately-\n- all separatists occupying government buildings should be disarmed and depart those compounds\n- amnesty would be granted to all anti-government protesters\n\nThe agreement also demanded that the violence end in Ukraine, and in an apparent reference to the circulation of \nreprehensible leaflets urging Jews to \"register\" in eastern Ukraine, it also condemned racism, extremism, racism, \nand religious intolerance, including anti-Semitism.\n\nBaroness Ashton said the agreement contained \"concrete steps\" that should be implemented \"immediately.\"  But \nwith an eye on ensuring that the agreement were not simply guiding principles but mandated actions, these steps \nwere to be  overseen by monitors from the  Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\nBeyond the immediate goals of the deal, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov espoused the Russian view that long-\nterm constitutional reforms would have to be implemented in Ukraine.  Left unsaid was what those constitutional \nreforms would entail although Russia has, for some time, advocated that Ukraine be transformed from a republic to \na federation.\n\nMeanwhile, regardless of the apparent success of diplomacy (at least on April 17, 2014), United States Secretary of \nState Kerry retained a bitter tone when he praised Ukraine for showing extreme restraint in regards to provocation \nfrom pro-Russian cabals.  Kerry warned that the deal was only useful if its provisions were actually applied in \npractice.  He said, \"What is important is that these words are translated into actions and none of us leave here with \nthe sense that the job is done, because the words are on the paper...The job will not be done until these principles \nare implemented and are followed up on.\"\n\nWhile there were suggestions that the deal might result in a halt on further sanctions being levied against Russia, \nKerry made sure to point out that such measures remained on the table.  Kerry  warned that Russia could be \npresented with \"further costs\" if de-escalation, as set forth in the agreement discussed here, did not emerge. Kerry \nalso called on  Ukraine to do its part to subdue heightened tensions.\n\nIn the third week of April 2014, mediators from Europe were set to commence negotiations aimed at securing the \nsurrender of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.  That effort by mediators from the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) promised to be difficult since the pro-Russian cabals in the region were refusing \nto recognize the Geneva accord (discussed here).  As noted by Envoy Christian Schoenenberger of Switzerland \n(the country chairing the OSCE at the time): \"For the time being the political will is not there to move out.\"  He \ncontinued, \"That's the task of the monitors, to create this political will, inform the people, so eventually they will \nunderstand that the best option for them is to move out.\"  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia said that if \nthere was no progress, the Ukrainian government would look to the OSCE to \"work out practical steps for the \nimplementation of the Geneva agreement.\"\n\nNote that as of April 21, 2014, the viability of the Geneva accord seemed a matter of debate.  Pro-Russian militants \nshowed no interest in withdrawing from government facilities, and meetings with OSCE mediators yielded no \nproductive results.  Instead, both sides (pro-Moscow and pro-Kiev respectively) accused each other of breaching \nthe terms of the agreement.\n\nOn one side of the equation, pro-Russian activists  blamed Ukrainian nationalists from the group, Right Sector, for \nthe killing of three people at a security checkpoint.  On the other side of the equation, activists in Slaviansk \nindicated that they intended to \"dig in\" their proverbial heels as they moved to reinforce their barricades. In \nKramatorsk, masked gunmen ousted the local police chief and took control of the security services office.  \n\n\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian militants told international journalists that they had no intention of \ndisarming unless Ukrainian nationalist groups in the western part of the country disarmed first.\n\nWhile the OSCE mediators had not yet abandoned their mission to get the provisions of the agreement \nimplemented, the United States and the European Union made it clear that they would impose new sanctions on \nRussia if pro-Russian separatists did not soon disarm and remove themselves from government buildings.  Some \nWestern diplomats were indicating that the entire deal was an exercise in the futility and only served the purpose of \nbuying time for Russia to extend its grip in Ukraine. As noted by one European diplomat  in a conversation with \nReuters News over Putin's interest in seeing the Geneva accord implemented: \"Talks and compromises are just \npart of his tactics...He wants to have Ukraine.\" The fact that Western diplomats were actually expressing such \nviews -- admittedly \"off the record\" -- was a signal that the political climate for compromise was grim.\n\nMeanwhile, in a fresh show of support for Ukraine, United States Vice President Joe Biden arrived in the Ukrainian \ncapital of Kiev where he was set to unveil technical assistance measures.  Vice President Biden's presence was \nalso aimed at stressing the importance of moving forward with the provisions of the Geneva accord.  As noted by a \nspokesperson from the White House, \"He will call for urgent implementation of the agreement reached in Geneva... \nwhile also making clear ... that there will be mounting costs for Russia if they choose a destabilizing rather than \nconstructive course in the days ahead.\"\n\nOn the issue of Russia's \"destabilizing\" course, Ukraine release photographs that seemed to prove that the masked \ncombatants in eastern Ukraine  were under the control of Moscow.  Throughout, Russia has passionately dismissed \nthe charges that it was orchestrating the unrest in eastern Ukraine, and has insisted that masked gunmen bearing \nno military insignia were simply local activists who were driven to extreme action out of fear of the new authorities in \nKiev.  However, photographic evidence indicated that the gunmen were actually Russian operatives of the same \ntype believed to have carried out the takeover of Crimea. One gunman was even identified as Igor Ivanovich \nStrelkov -- a well known Russian intelligence agent with a long career in clandestine activities on behalf of the \nRussian government.\n\nThe White House in the United States endorsed the photographic evidence, with State Department spokesperson, \nJen Psaki, saying, \"There has been broad unity in the international community about the connection between \nRussia and some of the armed militants in eastern Ukraine, and the photos presented by the Ukrainians... only \nfurther confirm this.\"\n\nBy April 22, 2014, Ukraine's interim President Turchinov had called  for government forces to resume its offensive \noperation against pro-Russian rebels.  The Ukrainian leader made the decision after the gruesome discovery of the \ndead body of Volodymyr Rybak -- a politician from Turchinov 's own Batkivshchyna political party.  Tybak's body \nbore signs of torture. Another body showing signs of being subject to torture was also found in Slaviansk. These \ndiscoveries, along with the failure of pro-Russian militants to abandon their occupation of government buildings in \neastern Ukraine in violation of the Geneva deal, appeared to have spurred the Ukrainian leader to take a more \nhardline stance.  For his part, President Turchinov blamed Russia for the brutal killings as he said, \"These crimes \nare being carried out with the full support and indulgence of the Russian Federation...I call on the security agencies \nto re-launch and carry out effective anti-terrorist measures, with the aim of protecting Ukrainian citizens living in \neastern Ukraine from terrorists.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov tried to redirect the blame for the crisis in eastern Ukraine onto the United \nStates when he  said, \"There is no reason not to believe that the Americans are running the show.\"  A statement \nfrom Lavrov's ministry went further as it said, \"Instead of taking effective measures to implement the ... agreements, \nKiev, Washington and a series of European capitals continue to insist that it is only Ukrainian citizens defending \ntheir rights in the south-east of Ukraine who need to give up their weapons.\"\n\n\n\nBy April 24, 2014, Ukrainian forces had killed  five pro-Moscow rebels in the eastern part of the country and Russia \nwas flexing its military might as it  carried out military exercises close to the Ukrainian border, presumably to show \nthat it could invade Ukraine at will.\n\nWith the news emerging as well about Ukrainian commandos carrying out raids on pro-Russian checkpoints in \nSloviansk, and the ensuing deaths of at least two pro-Russian separatists,  Russian President Vladimir Putin \nwarned that if the interim Ukrainian authorities in Kiev used its  army  to attack the people of eastern Ukraine, it \nwould be carrying out a crime against its own people deserving on consequences.  Speaking from St. Petersburg, \nhe said, \"It is just a punitive operation and it will of course incur consequences for the people making these \ndecisions, including (an effect) on our interstate relations.\"\n\nBut even as Russia was threatening consequences for Ukraine, the United States was trained on Russia.  United \nStates President Obama  warned that his country was ready to impose fresh sanctions on Russia if it did work to \nend the crisis in eastern Ukraine. Speaking from Japan where the United States leader was on an official visit, \nPresident Obama said, \"We have prepared for the possibility of applying additional sanctions.\"  President Putin \ndismissed the threat of sanctions as being  \"dishonorable\" but unlikely to strike critical damage on Russia.\n\nIt was to be seen if Putin would be equally dismissive of the increased presence of United States forces in eastern \nEurope on behalf of its NATO allies.  To that end, a contingent of 600 United States troops arrived in Poland as an \neffort to shore up NATO support in the region, even as Russia built up its own military presence on the Ukrainian \nborder.\n\nAs well, United States Secretary of State John Kerry sharpened his rhetoric against Russia as he declared on April \n25, 2014 that Russia was responsible for \"deception and destabilization\" in eastern Ukraine.  \"This is a full-throated \neffort to actively sabotage the democratic process through gross external intimidation that has been brought inside \nUkraine,\" he said. Kerry also accused Russia of  \"playing an active role in destabilizing eastern Ukraine\" with \npersonnel, weapons, money and operational planning.\"\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine acknowledged on April 23, 2014,  hat they had  an American \njournalist Simon Ostrovsky in their custody.  A spokesperson for the pro-Russian militants in the eastern city of \nSlovyansk, Stella Khorosheva, said Ostrovsky was being held in captivity for  \"bad activities\" and that he would \nhave to be investigated.  The United States Department of State issued a demand for the safety and release of  \nOstrovsky, who was ultimately freed on  April 24, 2014.\n\nHowever, the news was not so good on April 26, 2014, for the  OSCE observers who were in eastern Ukraine to \nensure the Geneva accord was implemented. Eight OSCE observers were abducted by pro-Russian militants in the \neastern Ukraine city of Sloviansk under spurious charges of spying and held in captivity.  United States Secretary of \nStates John Kerry demanded that Russia use its influence to ensure the release of the observers. By the start of \nMay 2014, most of the OSCE observers being held in Sloviansk remained in captivity despite requests from the \nWest that Russia intervene into the matter, and secure their release.\n\nLatest Developments --\n\n- Dozens killed in clashes in the southwestern city of Odessa marking worst death toll in a single incident since \noutbreak of unrest\n- Pro-Russia activists, armed with automatic rifles,  stormed several official buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of \nLuhansk\n- Several separatists were reported to have been killed in a government offensive in Sloviansk\n- Pro-Russia activists, armed with clubs,  broke up a pro-Kiev rally in Donetsk\n- The self-declared leader of Donetsk said the region would not participate in the presidential election scheduled for \nMay 2014\n\n\n\n- Ukrainian President Olexander Turchynov condemned local security personnel in Luhanski and Donetsk for \n\"inaction\" and \"criminal treachery\"\n- Four soldiers and about 30 separatists were killed in an \"anti-terrorism operation\" in the eastern town of Sloviansk\n- Gunfire was reported in the port of Mariupol, which was taken over by pro-Russian militants\n- Accusations emerged about former President Yanukovych and his associates stealing billions of dollars worth of \nassets\n- Norway's defense ministry  suspended all defense co-operation with Russia except on border controls\n- The European Union published a new list of 15 individuals facing travel banks and asset freezes including major \nRussian intelligence officials\n- The United States issued sanctions against  individuals and companies with links to President Putin's \"inner circle\"\n- The United States said it would deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could conceivably \ncontribute to Russian military capabilities\n\nAt the end of the first week of May 2014, due to the violence in Odessa, Ukrainian authorities were trying to regain \ncontrol there while locals buried their dead.  Meanwhile, the negative rhetoric between Ukraine and Russia was on \nthe upswing with both sides accusing the other of tearing Ukraine apart. Indeed, there was a fairly open discourse \nabout the high possibility of war in eastern Europe.  Even previously cautious European leaders were speculating \nabout that outcome with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier saying,  \"The bloody pictures from \nOdessa have shown us that we are just a few steps away from a military confrontation.\"\n\nBy the second week of May 2014, in the  port city of Mariupol,  fierce fighting between Ukrainian forces and \nseparatists ended in the deaths of several people. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov explained that 20 \n\"terrorists\" were killed when pro-Russian militants tried to take control over the police headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile,  Russia was attempting to advance the image of a country stepping back from the Ukrainian conflict as \nit announced it was pulling back its military forces from the border with Ukraine.  Russia also urged the  separatists \nin the eastern  region to refrain from holding referenda on secession similar to the one that ensued in Crimea and \nended in the Russian annexation of that region.  Russia also expressed support for the presidential election in \nUkraine set for May 25, 2014. Previously, Russia had disparaged the notion of that election taking place in a climate \nof civil strife. Now, Russian President Vladimir Putin was saying that Ukraine's presidential election was a step \"in \nthe right direction.\"\n\nIt was not known if these statements from Russia were to be regarded as a ploy.  Such a possibility loomed large \nwhen NATO said that satellite imagery showed no evidence of a Russian pull back.\n\nAs well, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Crimea on May 9, 2014, to celebrate the anniversary of the \nallied victory over the Nazis in World War II. The presence of Putin in Crimea, which had been annexed by Russia \nonly a month before, was a sign that the Russian leader wanted to flaunt his effective \"victory\" over the Ukrainians \nwith regard to Crimea.  Clearly, he also wanted to extrovert his Russian nationalist agenda.  Putin made this \npurpose for his presence in Crimea clear when he declared: \"I am sure that 2014 will go into the annals of our \nwhole country as the year when the nations living here firmly decided to be together with Russia, affirming fidelity to \nthe historical truth and the memory of our ancestors.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Putin's presence in Crimea was frowned upon by the West, with NATO Secretary-General \nAnders Fogh Rasmussen saying, \"His visit to Crimea is inappropriate.\"\n\nBy the second week of May 2014, separatists in eastern Ukraine made clear that irrespective of Russia's call for \nthem to hold off on a breakaway referendum, they were going forward with that vote anyway.  To that end, self-rule\" \nreferenda ensued in eastern Ukraine in the areas of Donestsk and Luhansk on May 11, 2014.  Reports from the \nground indicated an overwhelming affirmative vote ratifying self-rule in Donetsk. In fact, the separatist leader in \nDonetsk, Denis Pushilin, warned that with announcement of the results in favor of self-rule, all Ukrainian military \n\n\n\ntroops in the region would be regarded as  \"occupying forces.\"  The next step for Donetsk was, apparently, to go \ndown the road of Crimea and petition for Donetsk to be \"absorbed\" by Russia.\n\nIn Luhansk, following the self-rule referendum there, rebels declared independence.  A statement by rebel leaders \nread as follows: \"The people of Luhansk Region declare the creation of a sovereign state -- the Luhansk people's \nrepublic.\"  The rebel leaders in Luhansk also said that the impending presidential election in Ukraine would not take \nplace within its new self-declared independent borders.\n\nOf course, it was to be seen if Ukraine would let wide swaths of eastern Ukrainian territory be lost to Russia as \nquietly as it assented to Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nWith  Donetsk and Luhansk providing  significant industrial production and more than 15 percent of Ukraine's GDP, \nUkraine was not likely to accept such a loss easily. In fact, the International Monetary Fund has warned that its aid \npackage to Ukraine would have to be renegotiated if that country loss significant industrial territory in the eastern \npart of the country.\n\nThe vote -- largely cast as both illegal and a sham by Ukraine and the West -- was marked by disorganization, no \nelectoral oversight,  and violence, with at least one death reported. As well, persons with Ukrainian loyalties \ncomplained of death threats and intimidation, probably contributing to a scenario in which the only persons casting \n(unregulated) ballots were likely in the self-rule or pro-Russian corners anyway.  For his part, Ukraine's acting \npresident said in an address to the parliament, \"The farce that terrorist separatists call a referendum is nothing \nmore than propaganda to cover up murders, kidnappings, violence and other serious crimes.\"  The United States \nand European Union joined the chorus of international powers condemning the referenda, with Herman Van \nRompuy, the president of the European Council of European Union leaders, saying, \"We will not recognize the so-\ncalled referendums of yesterday. They are illegal, illegitimate and incredible.\"\n\nPresidential election in Ukraine\n\nA presidential election was set to be held in Ukraine on May 25, 2014.  The election was intended to democratically \ndecide a new head of state for the country, following the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014.  \nThere were also high hopes that the vote would settle the political landscape in Ukraine that deteriorated to a state \nof turmoil in the eastern part of the country.  Indeed, the period following Yanukovych's ouster has been marked by \nthe refusal of Russia to accept the new pro-European government of Ukraine, a pro-Russian uprising in eastern \nUkraine, the Russian annexation of Crimea, and ongoing turbulence in Russian-speaking parts of the country.\n\nAhead of that election, Russian President Vladimir Putin promised his country would work with whatever new \nUkrainian administration emerged following that election. Putin said: \"We will respect the choice of the Ukrainian \npeople and will be working with the authorities formed on the basis of this election.\" The Russian leader made this \npledge presumably with an eye on easing tensions in eastern Europe even as pro-Russian separatists continued to \nlobby for Russian integration and rail against the Ukrainian presidential election.\n\nPutin's tone of cooperation was welcomed by the West, which has been bedeviled by questions of how to deal with \nnationalist Russian ambitions in recent times.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine, all eyes were on a billionaire businessman and former cabinet minister Petro Poroshenko as \na favorite  to win the Ukrainian presidency although  veteran politician, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko,  \nwas also viewed as one of the more significant players in the political game.  In truth, however, the attention was \nless on which politician would emerge as the victor, and more on the matter of the election being a proxy sign for \nstabilization in the Ukrainian political scene.\n\nElection result:\n\n\n\nAfter the ballots were counted, it was the business tycoon, Petro Poroshenko, who claimed victory in Ukraine's  \npresidential contest.  The man known as the \"chocolate king\" because of his confectionary business enterprise, \nRoshen Chocolates, was also the owner of a television station and  manufacturing interests.  He was on track to \nsecure 55 percent of the vote share and, thus, outright victory.  Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was in a \ndistant second place with 12 percent of the vote share; however, she was quick to concede defeat and offered \ngracious congratulations to Poroshenko and to Ukraine, declaring: \"I want to congratulate the whole of Ukraine \nsince despite external aggression, despite the Kremlin's intent to disrupt this election we had an honest and \ndemocratic election in Ukraine.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former boxing champion-turned opposition politician  Vitaliy Klitschko was on track (according to exit \npoll data) to become the new mayor of Kiev.  Klitschko  had abandoned his bid for the presidency, turning instead to \nthe mayorship as his first main foray into the political heavyweight scene in Ukraine; however, he was quick to \nendorse Poroshenko prior to the presidential contest, who was headed for the presidency.\n\nThe defeat of former Prime Minister Tymoshenko indicated that Ukrainians were ready for fresh leadership.  To that \nend, Poroshenko also called for fresh parliamentary elections later it the year. Poroshenko additionally promised \ncloser ties with the European Union -- effectively consolidating the pro-Western bent of Kiev since the ouster of \nYanukovych at the start of the year.  The new president also promised to work to restore peace and stability in the \nvolatile eastern zone of the country, although Porpshenko made it abundantly clear that he would never recognize \nRussia's \"occupation of Crimea.\" The new president also warned that in regards to relations with Russia, his \nbiggest priority would be the \"sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of Ukraine.  Clearly, Poroshenko was a fierce \npatriot, aware of the nationalist overtones of the citizenry in recent times, and was determined to send the message \nthat he would defend his country.\n\nIt should be noted that the election did not go off smoothly in those restive eastern regions where pro-Russian \nseparatists did their best to disturb and disrupt the democratic process there. Indeed, there were no polling stations \nopen in Donetsk where separatists hold sway.\n\nThat being said, the election was regarded as a positive development on Ukraine's difficult and tumultuous political \nlandscape in recent times.  As noted by United States President Barack Obama,  the election in Ukraine was an \n\"important step forward in the efforts of the Ukrainian government to unify the country.\"\n\nPost-election Developments:\n\nIn the days after the election of a new president, Ukraine was subject to bloodshed and violence.  On May 27, \n2014,  pro-Russian separatists tried to seize  the airport in the eastern city of Donetsk.  Newly-elected President \nPoroschenko made good on his promise to take a hardline approach to separatists and launched  a rapid air and \nland assault.  While dozens of people -- mostly separatist fighters -- were killed as a result, Ukrainian forces were \nable  to regain control over the Sergei Prokofiev  airport in Donetsk.  The action shifted only two days later to the \neastern city of Sloviansk when pro-Russian separatists  shot down a Ukrainian army helicopter, killing 12 people \nincluding an army general. Ukraine's newly elected President Poroshenko warned that the pro-Russian rebels \nresponsible for the attack would be punished.  He said, \"These criminal acts of the enemies of the Ukrainian people \nwill not go unpunished. This is the moment of deep sorrow, and I express my sincere condolences to the families \nand relatives of the victims. We must make every effort to make sure that no more Ukrainians die at the hands of \nterrorists and bandits.\"\n\nIn the first week of June 2014, the bloodshed and violence in eastern Ukraine was ongoing.  Ahead of the \npresidential inauguration ceremony, battles between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists \nsparked the landscape in the areas of  Sloviansk and Donetsk.  As well, pro-Russian separatists claimed they  \nbrought down an army surveillance helicopter close to Sloviansk and seized a hospital in Donetsk.\n\n\n\nInauguration:\n\nOn June 7, 2014, Petro Poroshenko was officially inaugurated as the new president of Ukraine.  The day before, \nPorosehnko had a brief and unofficial meeting with his Russian counterpart, Putin, in France where world leaders \nmarked the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.  Putin appeared to strike a conciliatory tone as he expressed \nsupport for  Poroshenko's plans to end the violence in eastern Ukraine, saying he \"overall has the right approach\" \nto the crisis.  That being said, Putin urged  Poroshenko to end \"punitive\" military operations against pro-Russian \nseparatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMultilateral action:\n\nWith an emphasis on security and stability in eastern Europe, United States President Barack Obama soon \nannounced a $1 billion fund earmarked for  security in eastern Europe.  The gesture was welcomed by NATO allies \nin Europe.\n\nEntering the fray at the start of June 2014, NATO moved to bolster its security presence in eastern Europe as a \ndeterrent against Russian aggression. According to NATO head Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO  defense \nministers forged an agreement to  develop a \"readiness action plan... to respond to the changed security \nenvironment\" that had evolved in eastern Europe as a result of  the conflict in Ukraine.  He added, \"We agreed that \nwe will continue to reinforce NATO's collective defense with more air and sea patrols and more exercises and \ntraining, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.\" \n\nRasmussen also took the opportunity to note that  Russia's annexation of Crimea was \"a blatant breach of the 1997 \nFounding Act.\"  This reference was to the fact that the  1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act formalized post-Cold War \nborders in Europe and made clear that the West, the United States, and Russia would refrain from  deploying forces \nor arms in the newly-independent nation states of eastern Europe in an aggressive mode.\n\nWith no small measure of irony, Russia responded to the news of NATO's decision to increase its security presence \nin eastern Europe by accusing NATO of breaching the same 1997 treaty.  Left unaddressed by Russia was its own \nactions in Ukraine and its adherence (or lack thereof) to the  1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act. But Rasmussen \nwas adamant that NATO  had no choice but to take measures to counteract the threat posed by Russia.\n\nOn the matter of the threat posed by Russia,  United States President Barack Obama publicly condemned Russia's \naggression in Ukraine. During a trip to Europe at the start of June 2014, President Barack Obama said, \"We will not \naccept Russia's occupation of Crimea or its violations of Ukraine's sovereignty. As we've been reminded by \nRussia's aggression in Ukraine, our free nations cannot be complacent in pursuit of the vision we share -- a Europe \nthat is whole and free and at peace.\"\n\nPresident Obama also took the opportunity to meet with newly-elected Ukrainian President  Petro Poroshenko and \npledge support for that country's path towards stability.  That pledge included $5 million in military assistance to \nUkraine (separate from an earlier disbursement of aid funding in March 2014).\n\nMeanwhile, leaders of the world's industrialized nations at a meeting in Belgium warned they were prepared to levy \nfurther sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.\n\nIn a  joint statement, the leaders from G7 countries also excoriated Russia for its violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. \nThe statement read as follows: \"We are united in condemning the Russian Federation's continuing violation of the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We stand ready to intensify targeted sanctions and to consider \nmeaningful additional restrictive measures to impose further costs on Russia should events so require.\"\n\n\n\nPerhaps faced with the reality that further international action might be at play, Russia moved in a conciliatory \ndirection in the second week of June 2014.  At issue was a series of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine that \nwas being brokered by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Following the talks \nbetween Moscow and Kiev, the authorities in Ukraine said they would work towards \"mutual understanding\" with \nRussia in actualizing newly-elected Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's stabilization plan.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry issued a brief statement noting that Russian and Ukrainian representatives had met \nseveral times  to discuss Poroshenko's plan to end the violence in the eastern part of the country.  The statement \nread as follows: \"As a result of the work, the sides reached a mutual understanding on key stages of the \nimplementation of the plan and on a list of priorities which will contribute to a de-escalation of the situation in the \nDonetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.\"\n\nIn the background of these negotiations were threats by Russia that it would turn off its gas supplies is a \nsatisfactory agreement with Ukraine was not reached. Clearly, this was Russia's \"back pocket\" ammunition that it \nwas willing to use as a counterpoint to the West.  This threat was itself a concern to European countries who \nreceive significant gas imports from Russia -- and via Ukraine.\n\nNote that on June 12, 2014,  Russia indicated it would submit a draft resolution to the United Nations Security \nCouncil pressuring Ukraine to move forward with the OSCE's \"roadmap\" to peace.  That roadmap was actually \ndrafted in May 2014 and according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Ukraine was not adhering to the \nagreement's provisions.  Of course, from the point of view of Ukraine, the obstacles to peace were emanating from \nMoscow and not Kiev.\n\nAlert:\n\nAttempts to return Ukraine to stability were severely marred by an incident in mid-June 2014 when pro-Russian \nseparatists shot down a Ukrainian army transport plane in the eastern part of the country, killing as many as 50 \ntroops. The incident took place  at the Luhansk airport as the aircraft was coming in for a landing. While the \ngovernment held control over the airport, pro-Russian separatists held sway elsewhere in the city.  Already, there \nwere claims by pro-Russian separatists that they shot down a Ukrainian air force bomber in the Donetsk region.\n\nPresident Petro Poroshenko responded by convening his security team for talks and promising of an \"adequate\" \nresponse to the killing of some 50 servicemen.  He declared a period of mourning and warning, \"All those involved \nin cynical acts of terrorism of this magnitude must be punished.\"  He continued, \"Ukraine needs peace. \nCounterterrorism receives an adequate response.\"\n\nIt should be noted that pro-Russians showed little regret, with one separatist saying to Reuters News, \"This is how \nwe work. The fascists can bring as many reinforcements as they want but we will do this every time. We will talk to \nthem on our own terms.\"\n\nIn more positive news for the Ukrainians, their forces were able to reclaim control over the major port town of \nMariupol, with the Ukrainian flag returned to its place -- flying above the regional government compound.\n\nMeanwhile,  the global community was not ignoring the fact that pro-Russian separatists had access to significant \nmilitary equipment -- a disturbing revelation for a so-called \"grassroots\" separatist movement. All eyes were on \nRussia as the likely source of such military resources.  The United States  Department of States spokesperson, \nMarie Harf, noted: \"We assess that separatists in eastern Ukraine have acquired heavy weapons and military \nequipment from Russia, including Russian tanks and multiple rocket launchers.\"  Harf added that a convoy of tanks, \nrocket launchers, and other military vehicles crossed from Russia into eastern Ukraine in mid-June 2014.  She said, \n\"Russia will claim these tanks were taken from Ukrainian forces, but no Ukrainian tank units have been operating in \nthat area. We are confident that these tanks came from Russia.\"\n\n\n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen had said that if these reported deployments were verified, they \nwould constitute an \"escalation\" of the Ukrainian crisis.  Unsaid by Rasmussen was the matter of how NATO would \nrespond although he demanded that  Russia withdraw its military forces on the border with Ukraine, \"stop the flow \nof weapons and fighters across the border,\" and \"exercise its [Russian] influence among armed separatist to lay \ndown their weapons and renounce violence.\"\n\nBy the third week of June 2014, eastern Ukraine was beset by fierce fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-\nRussian separatists.  The advantage appeared to be with Ukrainian forces as a pro-Russian commander admitted \nthat the separatists were suffering heavy losses.\n\nWhile President Petro Poroshenko had been considering a resolution plan to end the uprising and violence in the \neastern part of the country, he was nonetheless prepared to take a hardline approach against pro-Russian \nseparatists.  On the domestic agenda, Poroshenko also confirmed he would sign the association agreement with \nthe European Union officially moving his country westward and further out of Moscow's orbit.  It was the status of \nthat very agreement that sparked the turmoil in Ukraine from late 2013 well into 2014. \n\nIt should be noted that Poroshenko's moves were finding resonance among Ukrainians in other parts of the country \nwho were tired of being at the mercy of Moscow and its pro-Russian factions in Ukraine.\n\nBy June 20, 2014, the Ukrainian president called for a ceasefire as part of his aforementioned resolution plan.  Also \nincluded in the plan's provisions was an amnesty for  separatists willing to lay down their weapons, the release of \nhostages, and the establishment of a \"regime of control\" on the Ukrainian-Russian border.\n\nOn paper, the plan appeared to be a reasonable attempt to garner Russian support and on June 21, 2014, Russian \nPresident Putin issued a handful of statements in favor of the ceasefire, although he noted that there would have to \nbe negotiations with the separatists to ensure the truce did not collapse.  The statement by Putin was released \nofficially by the Kremlin and read as follows: \"The opportunity which the ceasefire opens up should be used to start \nmeaningful negotiations and political compromise between the opposing sides in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nBut the Ukrainian government was soon forced to accept that the separatists were not interested in disarmament \nand a new burst of fighting broke out.  Pro-Russian separatists stormed a Ukrainian military base and attacked  \nborder posts by  on the very night the ceasefire was to go into effect.\n\nAs noted by a government forces spokesperson, Vladyslav Seleznyov, \"We issued an ultimatum to the terrorists \novernight to surrender their weapons. We guarantee their safety and investigation in line with Ukrainian law ... They \nrefused.\"  As a consequence, Ukrainian forces responded militarily, with most of the losses being suffered by the \nrebel side, as noted above.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on behalf of his country, United States Vice  President Joe Biden made clear to Ukrainian \nPresident Poroshenko there would be \"further costs on Russia\" if it failed to use its influence to halt the violence by  \nseparatists in the eastern part of Ukraine.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was at the same time signaling the alarm about the \ndeployment of thousands of Russian troops along Ukraine's  eastern border.  He said, \"I consider this a very \nregrettable step backwards. It seems Russia keeps the option open to intervene further in Ukraine.\" he added a \nwarning: \"The international community would have to respond in a firm manner if Russia were to intervene further in \nUkraine.\"\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Russian officials have denied that they built up forces on the joint border with Ukraine, just \nas they denied that they provided military equipment to pro-Russian separatists, and certainly in much the same \nway as they have dismissed accusations that Russia has fomented separatist unrest in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAdding to the pressure on Russia was the warning from the European Union and other Western powers that it \nwould impose further sanctions on Russia if it failed to defuse tensions and more pro-actively support the peace \nprocess in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry warned that his country was collaborating with European partners to \nprepare a new round of sanctions against Russia.  United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague cautioned that \nif Russia did not \"stop the flow of arms across the border and stop supporting illegally armed separatist groups,\"  \nthe argument in favor of for harsher sanctions  would \"of course become stronger.\"  German Chancellor Angela \nMerkel joined the chorus, noting during a discussion in parliament : \"Progress is slow... Diplomatic solutions are \nalways preferable but, if nothing else works, sanctions can be put back on the agenda.\"\n\nLater Developments:\n\nPerhaps with an eye on reducing the possibility of further international action, on June 24, 2014, Russian President \nPutin called on Russia's upper parliamentary house to revoke the right it had granted him authorizing military \nintervention into Ukraine to defend the Russian ethno-linguistic population there.  The upper parliamentary chamber \nsoon granted that request although some members of parliament noted that it would rapidly reinstate that \nauthorization, if the need arose.  A spokesperson for the Russian leader said that the move was aimed at facilitating \nthe peace process in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRegardless of the actual intent, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko welcomed the move, calling it a \"first \npractical step.\" Signaling that he was ready to extend his own olive branch, the Ukrainian president said that there \nwere plans afoot to establish more regional autonomy in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThese moves by global power-brokers notwithstanding, pro-Russian separatists continued to act in a provocative \nmanner.  Despite the fact that they had agreed to a temporary ceasefire with the Ukrainian government, the militant \nactivists continued to engage in fighting with Ukrainian forces. In the 24 hours after the truce was declared on June \n23, 2014, the Ukrainian  government said there had been approximately 45 violations by pro-Russian militants.  For \nexample, on June 24, 2014,  at least one Ukrainian soldier was killed and several others were wounded due to the \npro-Russian separatists' violation of the truce.  On that same day, pro-Russian separatists  shot down a Ukrainian \nmilitary helicopter, killing all nine persons on board the aircraft.  Around the area of Slaviansk, separatist  militias \nwere using grenade launchers and mortars to  attack a military post.  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko issued \na hardline response, telling Ukrainian forces to return fire if they were attacked and threatening to abandon the \ntruce completely.\n\nBy the start of July 2014, Ukrainian President Poroshenko ended the  government ceasefire, which had been \nestablished in order to pursue peace talks. Explaining his decision, the Ukrainian leader said, \"The unique chance \nto implement the peace plan was not realized. It happened because of the criminal actions of the militants. They \npublicly declared their unwillingness to support the peace plan as a whole and in particular the ceasefire.\"\n\nIn fact, the pro-Russian separatists refused to disarm and repeatedly violated the truce, as exemplified by the \nincident in which they shot down a helicopter thus killing nine individuals on board. Moreover, as noted by several \nUkrainian security experts, the rebels were not simply unwilling to support the peace plan, but had used the \nceasefire to regroup and reassert their campaign of violent resistance.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, President Poroshenko wasted little time after ending the ceasefire and resumed a full-scale military \noperation against pro-Russia separatists in the eastern part of the country.  In a national broadcast, the president \nemphatically asserted:\n\n\"The decision not to continue the ceasefire is our answer to terrorists, militants and marauders.\"  He then declared:  \n\"We will attack, we will free our land.\"  Ukraine's parliamentary Speaker Oleksander Turchynov said in an address \nto the legislative body of Ukraine, \"I can inform you that in the morning the active phase of the anti-terrorist \noperation was renewed. Our armed forces are carrying out strikes on terrorist bases and checkpoints.\"\n\nIndeed, Ukrainian military forces were soon launching an aggressive operation against pro-Russian separatist \nbases in the eastern regions using aerial bombardment and artillery strikes. The Ukrainian military appeared to \ncalculate the operation as a success, issuing the following statement: \"The terrorists' plan to significantly escalate \narmed confrontation has been disrupted and the threat of losses to the civilian population and service personnel \nhas been liquidated.\"\n\nPredictably, Russia condemned Ukraine's move and President Vladimir Putin promised to protect the interests of \nethnic Russians in Ukraine.  Putin also tried to give the impression that his stance was backed by Western \nEuropean powers as he said, \"Unfortunately President Poroshenko took the decision to restart military operations \nand we \u2013- I mean myself and my European colleagues \u2013- could not convince him that the road to stable, strong and \nlong-lasting peace does not lie through war.\"\n\nIn truth, it was difficult to determine in Western powers such as Germany and France shared this interpretation of \ntheir stances.  For her part, German Chancellor Angela Merkel renewed threats of further sanctions against Russia, \nsaying of that country's willingness to violate Ukraine's territorial integrity: \"Regarding sanctions against Russia, we \nhave so far reached level two and we cannot rule out having to go further.\"\n\nThat being said, Germany was also working to bring Russia, pro-Russian separatists, and Ukraine together, with an \neye on a fresh ceasefire. At issue was a plan for multilateral negotiations involving all three parties, with the \nobjective of forging a  new ceasefire.  To this end, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier held talks with \nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin,  and French Foreign Minister \nLaurent Fabius .  Following that meeting, which he described as \"constructive,\" he indicated that progress had been \nmade in moving -- at least -- in the direction of multilateral negotiations starting  on July 5, 2014.  Those \nnegotiations would focus on establishing a new ceasefire that would be  monitored by the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Also on the agenda would be the terms of the ceasefire, cessation of violence \non all sides, the release of hostages, and the return of control over Ukrainian border points from Russia to Ukrainian \ngovernment control. With concurrence being found on following this path, the German foreign minister said,\n\n\"It is a clear commitment to a multilateral ceasefire\" and added that all parties \"realize what responsibility we bear.\"\n\nA turning point for eastern Ukraine?\n\nAs July 2014 moved through its second week, Ukrainian troops recaptured the pro-Russian separatist stronghold of \nSloviansk.  Ukrainian President Poroshenko characterized the  event as a \"turning point\" in the eastern Ukrainian \nconflict that for months saw momentum on the rebel side.  President Poroshenko noted that the return  of the \nUkrainian flag in Sloviansk  was not a total victory, but instead a  symbolically significant development.  He said, \n\"This is not a complete victory yet, and it is not the time for fireworks displays. But the cleansing of Sloviansk from \ngangs who are armed to the teeth is of huge symbolic importance. This is the start of a turning point in the fight \nagainst the militants.\"\n\nIndeed, offensive operations in the eastern part of the country were ongoing with the pro-Russian separatists still in \ncontrol of the regional capitals of Donetsk and Luhansk. Still, the recapture of  Sloviansk -- the military center of the \n\n\n\nself-declared People's Republic of Donetsk --  indicated that the energy was on the side of the pro-government \nforces.\n\nFor their part, some rebels claimed they were simply going forward with a \"tactical retreat\" from Sloviansk; however, \nin truth, as many of them moved towards  Horlivka, they were being intercepted by government troops.  Moreover, \nother rebels were admitting that morale was low among the pro-separatist factions, with many of them claiming they \nhad been abandoned.\n\nThat low morale was not likely to be boosted by the news on July 6, 2014, that pro-government forces had \nrecaptured the east Ukrainian towns of Artyomivsk and Druzhkivka.  While  being of  far less strategic value than \nSloviansk, the hold on  Artyomivsk and Druzhkivka reinforced the view expressed by President Poroshenko that \nUkraine had reached a turning point. To that end, the Ukrainian president was poised to continue -- and even \nintensify -- the offensive assault against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Via Twitter, President \nPoroshenko declared, \"My order is now in effect -- tighten the ring around the terrorists. Continue the operation to \nliberate Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\"\n\nIt should be noted that this military mission in eastern Ukraine meant that the proposed multilateral meetings \n(discussed above) were now less likely to involve separatist rebels. Those meetings were intended to discuss a \nrenewed truce.\n\nThe prospects for a renewed ceasefire looked bleak on July 12, 2014, following a rocket attack by pro-Russian \nseparatist rebels on Ukrainian soldiers close to the border with Russia.  That attack involved a relentless volley of \nGrad missiles and left 20 Ukrainian troops dead and close to 100 others injured in the border village of \nZelenopillya.  Ukrainian President Poroshenko promised retribution, vociferously declaring that his forces would root \nout those responsible for the bloodshed.  The Ukrainian leader asserted: \"For every life of our soldiers, the militants \nwill pay with tens and hundreds of their own. Not one terrorist will evade responsibility. Everybody will get what is \ncoming to them.\"\n\nIt should be noted that around the same time of this deadly attack by pro-Russian separatist rebels in eastern \nUkraine, a human rights organization publicized a damning report on abuses, including torture, by pro-Russian \ngroups. Amnesty International's report titled \"Abductions and Torture in Eastern Ukraine\" accused pro-Russian \ngroups of abducting hundreds of people, and targeting protesters and journalists particularly.  Amnesty International \nnoted in the report that its investigators had discovered \"graphic and compelling evidence of savage beatings and \nother torture\" by pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine.  Ukrainian government forces were not exempt from \ncriticism, with the human rights group noting that abuses had been committed on that end as well, albeit at far less \nof a pervasive level.\n\nIn mid-July 2014, a Ukrainian military transport aircraft was shot down in the eastern part of the country.\n\nCrew members were reported to have survived the attack and a search and rescue mission to find them was \nongoing.  It should be noted that the transport military aircraft was shot down using a missile launcher and was \nquite likely fired from Russian territory.  While Russia did not offer any feedback on that report, pro-Russian rebels \nwere being quite forthright about their intent to target the aircraft.\n\nAlso in mid-July 2014, Ukrainian forces launched air strikes on the pro-Russian stronghold of Luhansk, with the  \nUkrainian air force announcing it had  successfully carried out \"five powerful air strikes\" on targets in the eastern \nregion.  Ukrainian authorities also announced that the country's military forces now held control over several \nvillages around Luhansk and that the airport was no longer being blocked by pro-Russian separatists.\n\nUnited States intensifies sanctions against Russia by targeting major firms --\n\n\n\nOn July 16, 2014, the Obama administration in the United States intensified its sanctions against Russia,  targeting \nlarge Russian firms as a punitive measure against Russia for failing to de-escalate the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nOn the target list of Russian firms  being hit by United States sanctions were significant defense and energy \ncompanies, as well as large banks.  Indeed, the targets of the new sanctions list included  Russia's largest oil \nproducer, Rosneft, as well as the country's  second largest gas producer, Novatek,  and  also Russia's  third largest \nbank, Gazprombank. Other targets included  Vnesheconombank, which functions as a payment agent for the \ngovernment of Russia, and eight weapons companies, most notably the one that produces Kalashnikov assault \nrifles.  Of significance was the fact that these particular enterprises were controlled by some of Putin's closest allies.\n\nThe new sanctions stopped short of cutting off entire key sectors of the Russian economy; however, they were the \nharshest measures to date against Russia. They were certainly  more damaging than the financial and travel \nrestrictions on a handful of individuals and businesses that went into effect months prior.\n\nAcross the Atantic in Europe, leaders were meeting to discuss the measures they would take to intensify  pressure \non Russia. Together, the West was coordinating their efforts to punish Russia; however, European sanctions were \nnot expected to go as far as those imposed by the United States .\n\nIn Russia, the government of that country was reacting with furor to the United States' action, charging that such \nsanctions constituted \"primitive revenge\" and promising retaliation. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev \nvituperatively cast  the sanctions as \"evil\" while Russian President Putin warned that the move would bring relations \nwith the United States to a \"dead end.\"  Putin also had sharp words for the European Union, which was yet to \nannounce its measures.  But with the knowledge that some action was in the offing, his government accused the \nEuropean bloc of succumbing to the \"blackmail of the U.S. administration.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk noted that the action by the United States and Europe to punish \nRussia for its complicity in the Ukrainian crisis showed that Western countries were united in their support for \nUkraine.  In a cabinet meeting, he said, \"All attempts by Russia to split the European Union, and to stop the \nEuropean Union and United States from agreeing, were doomed to failure.\"  He continued by demanding that \nRussia stop supplying weapons to Ukraine's rebels.\n\nGeopolitical crisis as civilian airliner is shot down --\n\nThe landscape in eastern Ukraine took a disturbing turn on July 17, 2014, when a civilian passenger aircraft \ntraveling from Netherlands to Malaysia went down in eastern Ukraine.  All 298 people aboard the Boeing 777 \nairliner perished when Malaysian Airlines flight 17\n\ncrashed in the rebel-held territory of Donetsk close to the Russian border.  Among the dead were nationals the \nNetherlands, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines,  Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, \nCanada, and United States among others. It was unclear if Americans were on board the flight.  That event raised \nthe stakes in the ongoing crisis in eastern Ukraine.  Indeed, it augured a geopolitical landmine as Ukraine said that \nMalaysian Airlines flight 17 bound from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down.\n\nBy far, the Netherlands suffered the greatest blow with the vast majority of the passengers aboard Malaysian \nAirlines flight 17 being from that country. Included in the dead was the  Dutch senator Willem Witteveen as well as \nthe world's leading HIV/AIDs researcher, Professor Joep Lange.  In fact, as many as 100 HIV/AIDs activists and \nresearchers were on the flight as they were scheduled to attend a conference in Australia.  Their collective deaths \nwere sure to strike a damaging blow to the global effort to fight the devastating  HIV/AIDs disease.\n\nFor his part, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, \"I am deeply shocked by the dramatic reports on the crash of \nMalaysia Airlines MH17\" while King Willem-Alexander expressed his heartfelt condolences about the tragedy.\n\n\n\nIn Malaysia, the loss of Flight 17 presented a painful blow to  Malaysia Airlines, which earlier in the year suffered \nthe mysterious disappearance of Flight 370, which was traveling  from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak gave voice the sentiment felt by his citizens as he said, \"This is a tragic day, \nin what has already been a tragic year, for Malaysia.\"  But the Malaysian head of government also expressed his \nshock and outrage over the fate of Flight 17, saying via the social media outlet Twitter,  \"I am shocked by reports \nthat an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.\"  Demanding justice, he was also on the \nrecord declaring, \"If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be \nbrought to justice.\"\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a statement that he would call  for an immediate investigation into the \nfate of the of the flight. While there was some hesitation at first from the Ukrainian president to attribute the crash of \nthe civilian airliner to a missile attack, he was soon unconditionally accusing \"terrorists\" in the eastern part of the \ncountry of shooting down Malaysian Airlines flight 17.\n\nVia the social media outlet, Twitter, Poroshenko declared:  \"MH-17 is not an incident or catastrophe, it is a terrorist \nattack.\"\n\nThe government of Ukraine also pointed to the fact that pro-Russian separatists had shot down a military transport \nplane only days earlier (discussed above). In fact, pro-Russian separatists have themselves been quite forthright \nabout their efforts to target aircrafts entering \"their\" self-declared air space.  To reiterate some of the coverage from \nabove, a month earlier in mid-June 2014, pro-Russian separatists shot down a Ukrainian army transport plane  as it \nwas landing at the Luhansk airport in the eastern part of the country, killing as many as 50 troops. At that time, pro-\nRussians showed little regret, with one separatist saying to Reuters News, \"This is how we work. The fascists can \nbring as many reinforcements as they want but we will do this every time. We will talk to them on our own terms.\"\n\nIn regards to the events of July 17, 2014, United States authorities were soon corroborating claims that the flight \nhad gone down as a result of a missile attack.  United States officials confirmed that based on its tracking of the \nmissile's final trajectory from infra-red sensors on a spy satellite, a surface-to-air missile had indeed been used to  \nimpact the Malaysian airliner, which was flying at about 30,000 feet at the time.  United States authorities stopped \nshort of attributing blame to any group, while making it clear that the missile attack was deliberate. Indeed, United \nStates Vice President Joe Biden expressly stated that the Malaysia Airlines jet was apparently \"blown out of the \nsky.\"\n\nLeaders of the rebel-held and self-declared Donetsk People's Republic denied being behind the missile attack on \nMalaysian Airline flight 17, with one representative saying to the international media, \"We simply do not have such \nair defense systems. \" He also noted  that their shoulder-launched Man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) \nhave the limited range of 4000 meters (around 13,000 feet).  It was certainly true that MANPADs are typically used \nby insurgent and terrorist movements  worldwide on low-flying aircrafts, and in this case, Flight 17 was known to be \ntraveling at the altitude of 30,000 feet.\n\nBut Ukraine was accusing the pro-Russian rebels of using  more sophisticated missile launchers, such as the \nRussian anti-aircraft Buk system (vis a vis MANPADs). The Buk system dates back to the 1970s; it is a radar-\nguided missile system, typically mounted on a truck, and codenamed SA-11 Gadfly. This system was absolutely \ncapable of the range needed to hit a plane flying at an altitude of 30,000 feet.  Ukraine was thus placing the blame \nat Russia for providing separatists with such sophisticated military equipment.\n\nWorthy of note was the fact that the United States has for several months been sounding the alarm about Russia \ntransporting heavy weaponry into eastern Ukraine. To recapitulate what was discussed above, pro-Russian \nseparatists have had  access to significant military equipment -- a disturbing revelation for a so-called \"grassroots\" \n\n\n\nseparatist movement.  All expectations were that Russia was the likely source of such military resources.  In June \n2014, the United States  Department of State made the assertion that separatists in eastern Ukraine had acquired \nheavy weapons and military equipment from Russia, and specified that these resources included Russian tanks and \nmultiple rocket launchers.  At the time, NATO warned of consequences if these claims were verified.\n\nMeanwhile, the accusations from Ukraine were bolstered by an unabashed claim of responsibility by a pro-Russian \nseparatist leader in Donetsk.  Igor Girkin (also known by the name of Strelkov) proudly claimed  credit for shooting \ndown an aircraft  near the border of Russia around the same time the Malaysian Airlines flight went down.  \nAccording to the Kiev Post, he proudly said, \"The plane has just been taken down somewhere around Torez \n(Donetsk Oblast). It lays there behind the Progress mine. We did warn you \u2013- do not fly in our sky.\" It could not be \nconfirmed if he was actually referring to the Malaysian Airlines flight, mistaking it for a Ukrainian military jet, or \nanother aircraft entirely.\n\nWhile Strelkov  was prepared to brag about taking down what he believed to be a Ukrainian aircraft, such hubris \ncan sometimes have deadly consequences. It was to be seen if Girkin would continue to claim responsibility now \nthat close to 300 civilians were dead as a result of a plane going down in the same area he was targeting.  It was \npossible that he and his Donetsk People's Army mis-identified Malaysian Airlines flight 17 for a Ukrainian army \nplane; as such, he might recant the claim of responsibility once  the geopolitical implications of accidentally  \nshooting down a passenger vessel became clear.\n\nThis version of the events that transpired -- that is, an accidental missile assault on a passenger jet misidentified as \na Ukrainian military aircraft -- was further augmented by leaked recordings of a pro-Russian rebel commander \ntalking to a Russian intelligence officer in which the pro-Russian separatists admit that they accidentally shot down \na passenger aircraft.\n\nAlong a related vein, the security services of Ukraine released three intercepted telephone conversations, which \nthat country said proved that pro-Russian separatists were responsible for downing the  Malaysian airliner.\n\nIn one recording, a pro-Russian separatist commander, Igor Bezler, was heard telling Russian military intelligence \nofficer, Vasili Geranin, \"We have just shot down a plane. That was Miner's group. It fell down outside Yenakievo.\" In \nthe second recording, two separatists were heard confirming that the missile attack was carried out by a unit to the \nnorth of the crash site.  In the third recording, supposedly between a local separatist leader and a militant, the \nfollowing statement is heard in relation to the downed flight:  \"Well then it was bringing spies. Why the hell were \nthey flying? There is a war going on.\"\n\nIt should be noted that both Russia and allied pro-Russian separatists denied any responsibility for the downing of \nFlight 17, irrespective of the material detailed in the leaked recordings mentioned just above.  In fact, some pro-\nRussian separatist leaders were going so far as to suggest that  Ukraine's armed forces may have shot down the \nplane, regardless of the fact that Ukraine was emphatic about the fact that it was not launching any missile attacks \nat the time.\n\nThe full facts of the tragedy were yet to be determined, but that process of fact-finding promised to be slow (and \nlikely hindered) by rebel separatists unwilling to aid the West, and certainly unlikely to assist in a process that might \nultimately implicate them as the culprits behind the downing of Malaysian Airlines aircraft.\n\nThere were attempts from the countries of the West to internationalize the fact-finding mission and evidence \nprocurement effort, in order to preserve the crash site as best as possible.  However, the pro-Russian separatists \nwere showing little indication that they would be willing to relinquish control over the territory where the crash site \nwas located.  In fact, they displayed little interest in assuaging the humanitarian concerns of the global community \nby simply respecting the bodies of the dead.\n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter was that the crash site was in the center of a war zone and under the control of rebels \nunfriendly to the West. Questions thus erupted as to why a commercial airliner would be flying about a conflict \nzone.  It should, however, be noted that the flight path followed by Malaysian Airlines flight 17 was an established \none for aircrafts traveling from Europe to Asia, and at an accepted level of 30,000 feet altitude.  Thus it was difficult \nto apportion blame to Malaysian Airlines when it was compliant with prevailing guidelines. That being said, some \ncountries such as United States authorities had earlier ordered its airliners to avoid flying over the Crimea region \nand eastern Ukraine, given the hostilities ongoing in that region of the world. Several other airliners from around the \nworld, however, continued to fly over the volatile region. Now, with the tragedy of Flight 17, Ukraine closed its air \nspace over the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on the situation in Ukraine on July 18, 2014. In \nthat emergency session, there was a call from the Security Council for a \"full, thorough and independent \ninternational investigation\" into the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight 17, as well as  \"appropriate accountability\" \nfor those responsible.  However, with the exception of these broad terms, the emergency session was marked by \ndissonance and acrimony as envoys from Kiev and Moscow respectively blamed each other for the tragedy.\n\nRussia blamed the crash of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 on Ukraine for carrying out its offensive operations in the \neastern part of the country against pro-Russian separatists.  At home, Russian President Vladimir Putin  was \nemphasizing this claim as he accused Ukraine of  creating the conditions for the uprising in eastern Ukraine that \nculminated with this tragedy.\n\nBut Ukraine dismissed this line of reasoning, characterizing the downing of a civilian airliner as an \"act of terrorism\" \nand releasing further intercepted phone recordings that it said proved Malaysian Airlines flight 17 was shot down by \npro-Russian separatists.  Yuriy Sergeyev, Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations,  went further by implicating \nRussia for the deaths of almost 300 people as he said that the attack have been impossible were it not for Russia's \ndecision to  provide sophisticated anti-aircraft missile systems to extremists.  At home in Ukraine, the government \nunderlined its accusations against Russia, announcing that it was in possession of \"compelling evidence\" that the \nmissile launcher was not simply provided by Russia,  but also operated by Russian citizens, who transferred the \ntruck-mounted Buk system back over the border into Russsia.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed any claims that his country was to blame, and instead accused \nUkraine of dishonesty as he declared in an interview with Russian media, \"I have not heard a truthful statement \nfrom Kiev for months.\"\n\nDuring the emergency session of the Security Council on July 18, 2014, the United States added its voice to the \naccusations that pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine were behind the downing of the Malaysian Airlines \njetliner.  United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said there was \"credible evidence\" \nthat a Russian-built anti-aircraft system located in a separatist stronghold had fired the missile that destroyed the \ncommercial Boeing 777 airliner and was thus responsible for the  killing of all 298 people aboard.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama expanded on the claims of Ambassador Power, saying that  a surface-to-air \nmissile fired from territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists was responsible for the tragic fate of Flight 17 and \ncast the missile attack as \"an outrage of unspeakable proportions.\"  The United States president asserted that he \nwould make sure that the real story of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 was told.  He said, \"This was a global tragedy... \nThe eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out.\" In a clear prod \nto his European counterparts who have been unwilling to press too hard on Russian President Putin for economic \nreasons, President Obama added that  the downing of the Malaysian jetliner  by Russian-backed separatists should \nact as a \"wake-up call for Europe and the world\" to act more assertively. President Obama also demanded that \nRussia cease its flow of both weapons and fighters into  eastern Ukraine.  For Americans wary of further \ninternational engagement, President Obama foreclosed the notion of United States military intervention into the \nUkrainian crisis; however, he made it clear that he was prepared to be more aggressive in its sanctions regime \nagainst Russia.\n\n\n\nWith outrage rising among the people of Europe, some leaders across the Atlantic were stirred to stake out firmer \npositions against Russia.  Germany warned that Russia was now being presented with its last chance to cooperate, \nwhile the United Kingdom indicated that the European Union should rethink its hitherto cautious approach to \nRussia, given the emerging corpus of evidence pointing to Russian culpability.  Following a meeting of the \nEuropean Union's  Foreign Council, a statement from the office of United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron \nwas issued.  Referring to the decision makers at that meeting, the statement read as follows: \"They ... agreed that \nthe EU must reconsider its approach to Russia and that foreign ministers should be ready to impose further \nsanctions on Russia.\"\n\nThe outrage in Europe rose to levels of furor on July 19, 2014.  On that day, news broke that personnel from the \nOrganization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) were prevented by pro-Russian separatists from \ndoing their work to secure the crash site and collect the bodies of the victims.\n\nIn fact,  a member of the OSCE team charged that the Russian-backed separatists behaved in an unprofessional \nmanner and exhibited a lack of respect for the bodies of the victims. In an interview with journalists, Michael \nBociurkiw, said: \"Unfortunately the task was made very difficult. Upon arrival at the site ... we encountered armed \npersonnel who acted in a very impolite and unprofessional manner. Some of them even looked slightly intoxicated.\" \nHe also said the bodies of the victims  had been left exposed to the elements.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry vociferously condemned pro-Moscow separatists at the crash sites in \neastern Ukraine for their poor treatment of the remains of victims. In an interview with NBC News, he angrily said, \n\"Drunken separatists have been piling bodies into trucks and removing them from the site...What's happening is \nreally grotesque and it is contrary to everything President Putin and Russia said they would do.\"  Kerry's \ncounterpart in the United Kingdom,  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, issued the following warning in an \ninterview with Sky Television; \"Russia risks becoming a pariah state if it does not behave properly.\"  Dutch Prime \nMinister Rutte said he was \"furious\" about the disrespectful treatment of the corpses of the victims.\n\nBy July 20, 2014, there was some progress at the crash site with emergency workers being allowed to place \ndozens of bodies in bags and prepare them for removal.  However, there was concomitant anxiety that the priority \nof pro-Russian separatists was to  hide evidence related to the downing of Flight 17. To that end,  Andriy Lysenko, \na member of Ukraine's Security Council,  accused the pro-Russians of a cover-up as he said in an interview with \nUkrainian media, \"The terrorists are doing everything to hide the evidence of the involvement of Russian missiles in \nthe shooting down of that airliner.\" The announcement from the self-declared leader of Donetsk, Aleksander \nBorodai, that the Boeing 777's \"black boxes\" were now in his hands did little to assuage those concerns.  According \nto international law, that flight recording equipment technically belonged to Malaysia and should have been \nimmediately turned over to that country.  On July 21, 2014, with international pressure on the rise, pro-Russian \nseparatists finally turned over the \"black boxes\" to the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nMeanwhile, at the United Nations Security Council, a draft resolution condemning the missile attack against \nMalaysian Airlines flight 17 was under consideration  The resolution would reportedly demand that emergency \npersonnel be allowed access to the crash site, and call on all regional parties to cooperate with an international \ninvestigation. Because such a basic resolution was not imbued by controversy, all expectations were that it would \nbe adopted.  However, it was to be seen if further action at the Security Council would include deterimining \nresponsibility for the tragedy, given the fact that  Russia held veto power on that body.\n\nAs discussed here, one likely avenue of action involved even harsher sanctions by the West against Russia.  The \nObama administration had already announced punitive sanctions against major Russian firms with close ties to \nPutin only days before.  Now, the United States could well intensify those measures unilaterally without having to \ndeal with the United Nations Security Council, which in recent years has metamorphosed into an impasse-ridden \nbody without any productive means to resolve major global conflicts.\n\n\n\nWith some 300 innocent civilians now paying the price in blood for the conflict in eastern Ukraine,  and with the \nproblematic behavior of pro-Russian separatists at the crash site, it was possible that the rest of the international \ncommunity might close ranks and present a unified front in confronting Russian interference into Ukrainian affairs. \nStated differently, the tragedy could well be a tipping point of sorts in the Ukrainian conflict.\n\nOutrage from families of the victims was certainly intensifying, particularly from the Netherlands, which endured the \nheaviest death toll.  In an address to the United Nations, Dutch Foreign Minister  H.E. Frans Timmermans  drew \nattention to the shocking treatment of the bodies of the crash victims in eastern Ukraine, saying: To my dying day I \nwill not understand that it took so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs and that \nhuman remains should be used in a political game. I hope the world will not have to witness this again, any time in \nthe future.\"  Foreign Minister Timmermans promised that the day of accountability would come in the future, saying, \n\"Once the investigation ascertains who was responsible for the downing of the flight MH17, accountability and \njustice must be pursued and delivered. We owe that to the victims; we owe it to justice; we owe it to humanity. \nPlease, provide full cooperation, so that justice can be served. My country will not rest until all facts are known and \njustice is served.\"\n\nThe mission to find who was responsible for the deaths of the victims was being augmented by the United States.  \nPresident Barack Obama visited the Dutch embassy in Washington D.C. to offer his condolences personally and \npromised to \"stand shoulder to shoulder\" with the Netherlands in its time of need. To this end,  United States \nSecretary of State John Kerry was stepping up his country's claims that Russia was complicit in the downing of \nFlight 17 by providing the separatists with  sophisticated anti-aircraft systems.\n\nIn the last week of July 2014, Ukrainian forces were making strides in the eastern part of the country, recapturing \nterritory in  Torez and Shakhtarsk and certainly challenging pro-Russian separatists who have held sway there for \nmonths. In fact, Ukrainian forces were bearing down on the  very area  where Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 went \ndown as a result of a Russian-supplied Buk missile system.  But because of fighting in the region, the area of the \ncrash was yet to be secured and emergency personnel and investigators were yet to complete their work, which \nincluded the recovery of human remains.  At the same time, the conflict was yielding a price in blood with both \nUkrainian soldiers and pro-Russian fighters dying as battles intensified in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAmong pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed leader of Donetsk was tacitly admitting that \nthey were enduring tactical losses in the period following the downing of Malaysian Airline Flight 17.\n\nBorodai retreated to Moscow for \"consultations\" and re-emerged in eastern Ukraine with reinforcements in the form \nof Vladimir Antyufeyev (also known as Vadim Shevtsov), who was immediately named was named \"deputy prime \nminister.\" A native Russian,\n\nAntyufeyev was a major player in Russia's effort to support pro-Russian separatists in the breakaway territory of \nTrans-Dnestria in Moldova.\n\nThese moves indicated that Moscow was at the center of the eastern Ukrainian separatist movement -- not only \nsymbolically, or even practically in terms of providing heavy military weaponry (which the United States said was \narriving in greater quantity in eastern Ukraine from Russia), but also tactically and politically as it was quite literally \ndirecting the separatist movement.  Indeed, Ukrainians with pro-Russian sensibilities were being shifted out of \nleadership roles in favor of Russians.  As such, there could be no illusions about Russian centrality in the Ukrainian \ncrisis.  Indeed, there could be no illusions about the fact that the mission to \"protect\" Russian speakers in eastern \nUkraine was just a proxy cause for a Russian war with Ukraine for daring to move out of Moscow's orbit. Ultimately, \nthis engagement in Ukraine was aimed at reconstituting what Vladimir Putin's vision of \"new Russia.\"\n\nAccountability, responsibility, culpability, and new sanctions against Russia --\n\n\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry was on the record on July 20, 2014,  saying that separatists in eastern \nUkraine used a surface-to-air missile from Russia to shoot down  Malaysia Airlines flight 17.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Kerry said that the United States had evidence of heavy weapons material being \ntransferred from Russia  into eastern Ukraine.  The weapons and equipment at stake included  a 150-vehicle \nconvoy of armored personnel carriers, tanks, and rocket launchers, which were given to the separatists. Kerry also \nnoted that the United States had access to intercepted conversations about the transfer  of the Russian radar-\nguided SA-11 missile system to the pro-Russian separatists, saying,  \"It's pretty clear that this is a system that was \ntransferred from Russia into the hands of separatists.\"  In a separate interview with CBS News, Kerry said, \"There's \nenormous amount of evidence, even more evidence that I just documented, that points to the involvement of Russia \nin providing these systems...training the people on them.\"\n\nKerry also dismissed separatists' accusations that Ukraine was behind the downing of the Boeing 777, noting that \nthe United States knew \"with confidence\" that the Ukrainian government had no Buk missile launcher in the area of \nthe attack.\n\nAccordingly, the United States' top diplomat echoed President Obama's challenge to Europe that it act more \naggressively. John Kerry said,  \"It would help enormously if some countries in Europe that have been a little \nreluctant to move would now recognize this wakeup call and join the United States and President Obama in taking \nthe lead, and also stepping up.\"\n\nBy July 22, 2014, United States officials had confirmed that the missile that brought down Malaysian Airline flight \n17, leading to the deaths of 298 innocent civilians, was fired from an area in eastern Ukraine under pro-Russian \nseparatist control.  United States authorities stopped short of accusing  Russia of being behind the firing of the fatal \nmissile; however, the Obama administration said its rationale for the latest tranche of sanctions was motivated by \nthe fact that Russia continued to arm the pro-Russian separatists. Moreover, the Obama administration was \nadamant in noting that even after the tragedy of Flight 17,  there continued to be a steady flow of arms from Russia \ninto eastern Ukraine -- including heavy weaponry such as missile systems.\n\nWith the people of the West demanding a stronger response from their leaders in regard to the downing of \nMalaysian Airline Flight 17, including accountability for those responsible, attention refocused on wider sanctions \nagainst Russia.  As noted by United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron, \"The latest information from the \nregion suggests that even since MH17 was shot down, Russia continues to transfer weapons across the border and \nto provide practical support to the separatists.\" Cameron argued that harsher measures against Russia were \nnecessary as he said, \"Leaders agreed that the international community should therefore impose further costs on \nRussia and specifically that ambassadors from across the EU should agree a strong package of sectoral sanctions \nas swiftly as possible.\"\n\nTo that end, on July 29, 2014, the United States and Europe imposed wider sanctions on Russia's financial, \ndefense, and energy sectors.  The sweeping punitive measures by the United States included accentuated \nsanctions against Russian banks, including the Bank of Moscow and the Russian Agriculture Bank, as well as \ndefense firms.  The measures also included a ban on technology sales to the Russian oil industry, which would \nnegatively impact the future development of the energy sector. Across the Atlantic, Europe moved  from limited \nsanctions against individuals to restricting the trade of equipment for the energy and defense industries, and  to \nlimiting \"dual use\" technology that would employ civilian and defense purposes.  Also included in the new sanctions \nregime was a ban on Russia's state-run banks from raising funds in European capital markets.\n\nThe new sanctions would be future tracked and thus not affect \"in process\" contracts such as France's sale of \nmilitary carriers to Russia.  Nevertheless, there would still inflict pain on certain European firms, such as British \nPetroleum, which  had a significant stake in the Russian oil company, Rosneft.  Also affected would be a slate of \nEuropean banks holding Russian credit accounts. German Chancellor Merkel had long been reluctant to go down \n\n\n\nthe road of harsh sanctions due to the potential harm to Germany manufacturing firms; but now she deemed the \npunitive measures against Russia to be \"unavoidable.\"  To be sure, the deleterious consequence of sanctions had \nbeen weighed in the European capitals since the start of the Ukrainian crisis; but they were ultimately deemed \nworth the price in the face of so many deaths on Flight 17, and in the interests of long-term regional security.\n\nAlso at stake was the matter of Western credibility. To that end, the complementary measures from the United \nStates and Europe stood as the strongest international action against Russia. They certainly constituted a show of \nsolidarity from the West in the face of escalating Russian engagement in the crisis in eastern Ukraine.\n\nFor its part,  Russia lashed backed rhetorically, accusing the United States of a \"slander campaign,\" and warning \nthat there would be decreased cooperation on regional security while members of parliament were drafting counter-\nmeasures to be levied against  \"aggressor countries.\"  As well, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov  was \nalready on the record dismissing the measures.  At a news conference, Lavrov said, \"We will overcome any \ndifficulties that may arise in certain areas of the economy, and maybe we will become more independent and more \nconfident in our own strength.\"\n\nIn truth, however, the Russian economy was not in the best of health and the added pressure posed by this harsher \ntranche of sanctions would not aid Russia.  In fact, unlike the targeted sanctions already in effect, these sectoral \nsanctions could potentially  inflict notable damage on the already-weak Russian economy.  As noted by United \nStates President Obama in an address after the new sanctions against Russia were announced, \"The sanctions \nthat we've already imposed have made a weak Russian economy even weaker.\"  President Obama also promised \nfurther action against Russia saying, \"If Russia continues on this current path, the costs on Russia will continue to \ngrow.\"\n\nWhile the new sanctions regime would undoubtedly ensure that Russia felt a strong dose of economic punishment, \nthere was also the question of whether there would be a penalty to be paid in the realm of international \njurisprudence.  While Russia appeared to have escaped unscathed from violating Ukrainian sovereignty and \nannexing Crimea, Russia's active continued engagement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as Russia's \nculpability in the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, were still matters demanding a response.  At the \nhumanitarian level, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, noted that the downing of \nthe Malaysian airliner by pro-Russian separatists using a Russian missile system would likely be classified as a war \ncrime.\n\nFor its part, Russia parried Western sanctions with some of its own.  On Aug. 6, 2014, Russian President Vladimir \nPutin ordered that restrictions be placed on  agricultural and food imports from Western countries for one year.  \nWhile the impact on Western trade would be felt, there would also be an impact at home in Russia, which relied on \nfood imports. Presumably, Russia would look to friendlier countries for food imports, such as the leftist autocratic \nregime of Venezuela, or perhaps Asia to the east.\n\nMilitary Note:\n\nAt the start of August 2014, Ukrainian government forces advanced on the eastern part of the country, forcing pro-\nRussian separatists into fierce battles on the outer perimeter of the separatist stronghold of Donetsk.  Already, \nUkrainian government forces  had surrounded  Luhansk.  By the second week of August 2014, Ukrainian fighter jets \nwere carrying out strikes on  Donetsk, although the government of Ukraine made it clear that it was not bombing \nany populated areas. While Russia retained control over Crimea, it was evident that the momentum was now with \nUkraine as it fought to retake the rest of its eastern territory from pro-Russian fighters. It should be noted that, \naccording to sources from Kiev, almost all these fighters were being \"led\" not by local  eastern Ukrainian separatists \nbut, instead, Russian citizens.\n\n\n\nThe fighting, however, was making it difficult for responders to do the job of collecting the human remains of the \nvictims of the tragic downing of Malaysian Airline Flight 17.  To this end, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Philip \nHammond called on to Russian President Vladimir Putin to persuade the rebels to stop interfering with the \ninternational experts who were carrying out the difficult recovery effort at the site Flight 17's wreckage. He said, \"It is \nan unspeakable abomination that, two weeks after this crash, there are still bodies on the crash site unrecovered \nand the Russians have not used their influence with the separatists.\" He continued, \"I said last week that there is \none man who can snap his fingers and make this happen and he hasn't done so. He must now do so.\"  But in fact, \nthat work was brought to a halt by Aug. 7, 2014, as the fighting in the region increased.  As noted by Dutch Prime \nMinister Mark Rutte, \"It doesn't make sense to continue the repatriation in this manner.\"\n\nOn Aug. 10, 2014, the Ukrainian military was pounding targets in the major pro-Russian rebel stronghold of \nDonetsk.  A spokesperson from the Ukrainian military, Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky, said that several strikes on enemy \npro-Russian positions were being carried out.  He said, \"A large number of enemy hardware and personnel was \ndestroyed. Panic and chaos have been noted among the terrorists.\" The offensive by Ukrainian forces was so \nintense, creating some degree of a seige scenario, that up to 300,00 residents had fled the city.  As well, several \nrebel fighters apparently deserted the rebel militias.\n\nAlexander Zakharchenko, the new prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk people's republic (a local who was \nattempting to ensure the separatist operation remained in the hands of locals and not under Moscow's control), was \ncalling for a humanitarian ceasefire to ensure basic supplies -- such as food, water, and medicine -- could enter the \narea of Donbass where fighting was going on.  He said, \"We are ready for a ceasefire to prevent the proliferation of \na humanitarian disaster in Donbass.\"  However, he was adamant in noting that a humanitarian ceasefire was not a \nsurrender and the effort would continue to defend Donetsk for pro-Russians.  Soon, the notion of a ceasefire was \nabandoned and Zakharchenko was claiming his forces would launch a counter-offensive against Ukrainian forces.  \nBut by Aug. 11, 2014, Ukrainian authorities said they were in the \"final stages\" of recapturing  Donetsk.\n\nElsewhere in the other  rebel stronghold of Luhansk, which was closer to the Russian border, many residents had \nleft or were living under desperate conditions since the electrical power system was no longer functional, while food \nand health supplies were scarce.  As well, Ukrainian military forces had gained control over the road between \nLuhansk and Donetsk, essentially restricting the flow of separatists' weapons in the region.\n\nWhile Ukrainian military forces were clearly on the offensive, Russia was not about to quietly retreat with the \nconsolation prize of Crimea alone.\n\nIn an apparent response to the momentum from Ukrainian government forces, Russia reportedly placed tanks, \nartillery, air defense systems, aircrafts, and special forces along Ukraine's border.  NATO warned that up to 20,000 \ncombat-ready Russian troops were now amassing along Ukraine's border.  In a statement,  NATO spokesperson \nOana Lungescu, said, \"We're not going to guess what's on Russia's mind, but we can see what Russia is doing on \nthe ground \u2013- and that is of great concern. Russia has amassed around 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's \neastern border.\"  NATO also  added that Russia could well use the same argument of \"protecting\" the Russian \nethno-linguistic population to move into eastern Ukraine in a ground assault.  Indeed, Russia had a record of \nexploiting that rationale as show by its actions in Georgian enclaves in 2008 and  as illustrated by the annexation of \nCrimea from Ukraine months earlier in 2014.\n\nAs of mid-August 2014, heavy fighting was reported to be going on close to Donetsk with Luhansk under the \nproverbial gun. Given the landscape in Donetsk and Luhansk, there was rising anxiety that Russia would use the \nsituation and the notion of a humanitarian mission to intervene in eastern Ukraine. \n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen reminded the global community that Russian troops remained \namassed on the Ukrainian border and said in an interview with Reuters interview  that there was \"a high probability\" \nof a Russian military intervention.  He said, \"We see the Russians developing the narrative and the pretext for such \n\n\n\nan operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation, and we see a military build-up that could be used to \nconduct such illegal military operations in Ukraine.\"\n\nLikewise, United State President Barack Obama said that any form of Russian intervention into Ukrainian territory \nwithout the consent from the Ukrainian government in Kiev  would constitute a violations of international law.  The \nEuropean Commission also delivered its own warning with President Jose Manuel Barroso during a phone call with \nVladimir  Putin.  In a statement, the European Commission summarized the conversation as follows: \"President \nBarroso warned against any unilateral military actions in Ukraine, under any pretext, including humanitarian.\"\n\nThere was little actual hope that Russia was heed these messages and, the Kremlin made it clear that it would \ndeploy a convoy to eastern Russia purportedly carrying humanitarian aid.\n\nBy Aug. 13, 2014, the movement of that Russian convoy was slowed when Ukrainian officials made it clear that \nthey would not allow the trucks to move into Ukrainian territory. Via his Russian Facebook page, Ukrainian Interior \nMinister Arsen Avakov wrote,  \"Provocation by a cynical aggressor is not permissible on our territory.\" Reports from \nthe ground said that the convoy had stopped in the area of  Voronezh area, while other reports indicated that the \nconvoy had diverted to the south. Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk characterized the Russian aid convoy as a \nmeasure of \"boundless cynicism.\"  He said, \"First they deliver tanks, Grad rocket launchers, terrorists and bandits..., \nand then they deliver water and salt.\"\n\nA day later on Aug. 14, 2014, Ukrainian forces were bearing down on Donetsk, quite literally encircling the city.  As \nwell, for the first time,  shelling  hit  the city center.  As well, Ukrainian forces took control of the settlement of \nNovosvitlivka, the remaining route used by the separatists to travel between Luhansk and Donetsk.  It was a clear \nstrategic gain for  Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, two leading separatist commanders aligned with Moscow resigned from their posts. Of note was the \nresignation of the well known  Colonel Igor Strelkov (also known as  known as Igor Girkin) who was regarded as \nthe  defense chief in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, but who was also believed to be a Russian  \nintelligence officer.  As well, Valery Bolotov, the head of the self-proclaimed rebel government in Luhansk, \nannounced he was stepping down due to injuries.  These two moves seemed to suggest the pro-Russian \nleadership in the two rebel separatist strongholds of Luhansk and Donetsk was in shambles, presumably because \nof the Ukrainian military offensive.\n\nUkrainian forces enjoyed a victory in the former separatist stronghold of Luhansk, which continued to be under \nsiege as of  Aug. 18, 2014.  While street fighting was still apparently going on in the city, Ukrainian forces were able \nto raise  their national flag over the Zhovtneviy  police station in Luhansk.  Control over Luhansk would be regarded \nas a crucial development since it is a major venue along the supply route from Russia into eastern Ukraine.  Not all \nthe news was postive for Ukraine as, once again, pro-Russian separatists were able to shoot down a  Ukrainian \nwarplane in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe action was also intensifying in Donetsk where the prime minister of the self-declared republic,  Alexander \nZakharchenko, expressed his confidence in holding the area. He pointed to the fact that his fighters would soon \nhave access to 150 armored vehicles, including 30 tanks, and 1,200 Russian-trained fighters , who would aid in a \nmajor counter-offensive intended to stave off ascendant Ukrainian forces.  His remarks should put paid to \ncontinuing  claims by Russia that it was not supplying pro-Russian separatists with arms and armies. Yet despite \nZakharchenko's declaration on video that \"they are joining at the most crucial moment\" a spokesperson for Russian \nPresident Putin, Dmitry Peskov, issued the following statement: \"We have repeatedly said that we don't supply any \nequipment there.\"\n\nNote that as of Aug. 19, 2014, Dontesk stood at the center of the battle between Ukrainian government forces and \npro-Russian separatists.  A gun battle in the middle of the city actually forced residents to flee the scene, as the \n\n\n\nfight to reclaim eastern Ukraine was now situated in the most significant stronghold for pro-Russian separatists.  \nRegardless, the fighting in Donetsk had deadly consequences with artillery fire striking apartment buildings, and \nkilling and wounding residents as a result.\n\nIn Yasynuvata, to the north of Donetsk,  Ukrainian forces took control there by recapturing a railway junction.  \nHowever, fighting between the two sides continued elsewhere in the town. Fighting was also reported in Iovaisk and \nTorez, with both sides issuing competing claims that they had the advantage.\n\nWhile fighting continued in eastern Ukraine, the  foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany had \nbeen meeting to try to achieve a ceasefire.  For Ukraine, France, and Germany, a main issue at the gathering was \nthe problem of fighters and arms crossing over the border from Russia into Ukrainian territory.  However, it was \nunclear how that objective would be achieved when, as indicated above, Russia has refused to fully acknowledge \nits active involvement in the Ukrainian crisis.  Also of note has been the fact that as Ukrainian forces achieve \nmilitary victories against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, the incentive to forge any kind of deal with \nRussia has been lessened to some extent.\n\nStill, it was to be seen if some diplomatic breakthrough could be reached at a summit in Belarus set for Aug. 26, \n2014.  While that event was aimed at discussing relations between the European Union and the eastern European \ncustoms union, it would nonetheless be attended by both  Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President \nPoroshenko, with the Ukrainian crisis at the center of the agenda.\n\nAhead of that meeting in Belarus, Ukraine marked its independence celebration on Aug. 24, 2014, with a military \nparade in Kiev. As well, President Poroshenko offered a passionate national address in which he said his country \nwas fighting \"a war against external aggression, for Ukraine, for its freedom, for its people, for independence.\"  He \nwarned of a future in which Ukraine would have to defend itself against that external aggression from Russia, \nsaying. \"It is clear that in the foreseeable future, unfortunately, a constant military threat will hang over Ukraine. And \nwe need to learn not only to live with this, but also to be always prepared to defend the independence of our \ncountry.\"\n\nPro-Russian separatists retaliated by marching captured Ukrainian troops through their stronghold of Donetsk. \nResidents both heckled and  threw bottles at the prisoners of war who were presented in the public square for \nridicule.  But Donetsk was soon returned to a site of conflict with fierce fighting reported on Aug. 24 and 25, 2014.\n\nNATO accuses Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty amidst rising fears of Russian invasion:\n\nIn the last week of August 2014, Russia again announced it would be sending another \"humanitarian\" convoy into \nUkraine.  This gesture -- like the previous humanitarian convoy -- was likely to be interpreted by the Ukrainian \ngovernment as an invasion of Ukrainian territory.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting in eastern Ukraine was not limited to the two main fronts of Donetsk and Luhansk.  The \nUkrainian military said that it engaged armored vehicles that crossed into Ukraine from Russia and were moving in \nthe direction of the port  city of Mariupol on the Azov Sea.  The Ukrainian military said the pro-Russian separatists \nmight be attempting to open a new front in the conflict and accordingly intercepted the column of armored vehicles  \nat Novoazovsk. Ultimately, however, pro-Russian separatists were able to seize control of Novoazovsk.  Elsewhere \n-- in the village of Markyne -- dangerous clashes were reported to be taking place.  Meanwhile, Russian forces \nreportedly destroyed almost every home in the town of Novosvitlivka close to the separatist stronghold of Luhansk.\n\nAs August 2014 was drawing to a close, there were fierce battles going on in Mariupol as separatists clearly were  \nmoving to open up a third major front.  However, Ukrainian government troops were determined to hold control on \nMaripol and deny the pro-Russians a foothold there.  Andriy Lysenko, a military spokesperson, said that Ukrainian \nforces would rally to defend Mariupol.  He said, \"Fortifications are being built. Local people are coming out to help \nour troops, to stop the city being taken. We are ready to repel any offensive on Mariupol.\"\n\n\n\nBut even with the defensive effort at Mariupol, Ukraine was being subject to Russian aggression. On Aug. 29, 2014, \nNATO accused Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty  and becoming embroiled in military operations in support \nof pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.  In truth, the Russian presence and involvement in the eastern \nUkraine conflict had been well-known for some time.  However, rather than a clandestine effort, now the Russian \nengagement was a far more direct operation. At issue were satellite images released by NATO showing  columns of \nRussian armed forces inside Ukrainian territory.  NATO warned that more than 1,000 Russian troops were now \noperating inside Ukraine.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen made it clear that \"despite hollow denials,\" Russia had illegally \ncrossed Ukraine's border and violated Ukraine's sovereignty.  Rasmussen said, \"This is not an isolated action, but \npart of a dangerous pattern over many months to destabilize Ukraine as a sovereign nation.\"  He continued, \"This is \na blatant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It defies all diplomatic efforts for a peaceful \nsolution.\"\n\nFor his part, Ukrainian President Poroshenko warned that his country was \"close to a point of no return\" with  \"full \nscale-war\" in the offing.  Speaking from Belgium where he was attending a meeting with European Union leaders, \nPoroshenko explained that  Ukraine was a victim of \"military aggression and terror.\"\n\nIn response to Russian aggression, Ukraine  declared its intent to apply for membership in NATO. Ukrainian Prime \nMinister Arseny Yatsenyuk said he would introduce a bill in parliament that would  call for the cancellation of \nUkraine's non-aligned status, and thus set the path for Ukraine to join NATO.  It was a move sure to anger and \noutrage Russia, which has long been concerned about Ukraine's alignment with the West. Ironically, though, it was \nprecisely Russia's aggression and interference into Ukrainian affairs that was driving Ukraine westward -- out of \nRussia's orbit and towards Europe and the United States.\n\nAs August 2014 drew to a close, Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed determined to reverse that westward \ndrift by force or will, if necessary.  On Aug. 31, 2014, Putin called for  negotiations on the \"statehood\" of southern \nand eastern Ukraine \u2013 underlining his stance that portions of Ukrainian territory should be removed from Kiev's \njurisdiction.  Around the same time, during a visit to a youth camp, he declared  that Ukrainians and Russians were  \n\"practically one people, \" essentially dismissing the particular historic legacy and cultural heritage of the Ukrainian \nnation.\n\nBefore the arrival of Russian troops and columns in eastern Ukraine, the conventional wisdom had been that  \nRussian President Vladimir Putin would use the organic gains for Ukrainian forces to gently back away from his \n\"New Russia\" ambitions, and instead rest his imperial laurels upon the annexation of Crimea.  But the apparent \ninvasion of Ukraine by Russian troops suggested that Vladimir Putin was not about to retreat quietly from his visions \nof \"New Russia.\"\n\nIt should be noted that while Putin was enjoying high approval ratings for his nationalist agenda at home in Russia, \nin the wider world, Russia's reputation internationally had suffered a cataclysmic meltdown. According to data \ncompiled by Pew Research, a majority of respondents in Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East viewed \nRussia unfavorably.  In Poland, for example, only 12 percent of people had a favorable view of Russia.  The \nincrease in hostility towards Russia from  2013 to 2014 was conceivably connected to Russia's lack of respect for \nUkraine's territorial integrity, compounded by fears from European neighbors that they too might suffer at the hands \nof Russian aggression.\n\nWould this global view have an impact on Russian policies? Governments in European capitals would no doubt \ntake note of the unfavorable way in which their citizens now viewed Putin's Russia.  Those governments could well \nbe spurred to hold steady with the sanctions regime against Russia as a result. With Russia oil trading at $100 a \nbarrel and with the Russian budget being based on $114 a barrel standard, and given the fact that Russia would \n\n\n\nnow have to deal with increased military spending, the effects on the Russian economy at home would eventually \nbe felt.  It was to be seen if the effect would extend to Putin's domestic popularity.\n\nOutside of Russia, however, Russian aggression in Ukraine was evoking negative reactions across Europe.  \nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said Russia was \"practically in a war against Europe.\"  Recognizing the \nvulnerability of any eastern European country, she said: \"We need to support Ukraine, and send military materials \nto help Ukraine defend itself. Today Ukraine is fighting a war on behalf of all Europe.\"  Meanwhile,  Poland denied \npermission for Russia's defense minister to fly over its air space following a trip to Slovakia.\n\nThe harshest condemnation of Russian aggression to date emanated from the president of Estonia.  President \nToomas Hendrik Ilves said: \"Ukraine is under attack by the armed forces of the Russian Federation. This military \naggression should finally dispel any doubts that Russia's words fail to match its actions.\"  A statement from the \noffice of the president issued the following declaration: \"It is not possible to speak seriously of a diplomatic process \nor of ceasefire negotiations while one country has brought without permission its armed forces de facto into \nanother, while refusing formally to admit its involvement in the conflict. The destabilization of Ukraine by Russia has \ncontinued for too long. Today, in addition to terrorists, clearly identifiable Russian military forces are operating in \nEastern Ukraine. In other words, this is an undeclared war. Russia's actions are a clear violation of the United \nNations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter. Western allies should agree on their part on the need \nto intervene in an even more determined way to protect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"\n\nFor its part, the European Union appeared poised to move forward with harsher sanctions against Russia.  German \nChancellor Angela Merkel said, \"I have to say there is also an impact when you are allowed to move borders in \nEurope and attack other countries with your troops...Accepting Russia's behavior is not an option. And therefore it \nwas necessary to prepare further sanctions.\"\n\nRegardless of these excoriations and warnings, Russia for the time being remained  undeterred by  its global \npariah status.  Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin  was thrusting forward with his vision of \"New Russia\" \nirrespective of the actual sense of self-determination felt by the Ukrainian people, or the rebuke being issued by the \ninternational community.\n\nNATO announces rapid reaction force and military exercises in eastern Europe:\n\nOn Sept. 4, 2014, at a NATO meeting in Wales, member states of the West agreed to form a new rapid reaction \nforce intended to respond to crisis scenarios in NATO countries. Included in the rapid reaction force would be an \nagile and precise \"spearhead\" force consisting 4,000 to 5,000 troops, and capable of being  deployed within 48 \nhours to any location across the Northern Atlantic alliance. \n\nThe head of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine's soverignty had been the catalyst \nforcing NATO to move forward with the formation  of the rapid-reaction force.\n\nNATO also moved  to intensify joint exercises in eastern Europe.\n\nThese actions were aimed at  delivering  reassurances to eastern European countries fearful of suffering a similar \nfate as Ukraine at the hands of Russian aggression. Of particular note were the  Baltic states; these countries were \nparicularly worried that Russian President Putin would use the same tactics -- the defense of ethno-lingusitic \nRussians in the region -- as he used to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2014, NATO followed up with its warning of intensifying joint exercises in eastern Europe by staging  \nmajor military exercises in Latvia. The exercises were aimed at simulating a crisis deployment of NATO forces in a \nmember state.  It was an act intended to remind Russia that NATO was committed to defending all member states, \nespecially those in the Baltics, from Russian aggression.\n\n\n\nHowever, General Hans-Lothar Domrose, the commander of the NATO military command in the Netherlands, noted \nthat the Latvian exercises were only part of the process as other NATO military exercises were set to take place in  \nEstonia, Lithuania, Poland and Germany as well.  Domrose explained, \"We want to assure our people that we are \nable to protect them.\"  He continued, \"Certainly on top of this we send a clear message to everyone who wants to \nthreaten NATO, that it's not a thing you should do. NATO will always defend and protect its people.\"\n\nPredictably,  Russia reacted unfavorably to NATO's announcements and promised that there would be increased \ntensions as a result.  A statement from the Russian foreign ministry declared: \"The essence and tone of [NATO] \nstatements on the Ukraine situation, and the plans announced to hold joint NATO exercises with Kiev on the \nterritory of that country before the end of 2014, will inevitably lead to heightened tension.\" \n\nFor his part,  Russian President Putin reacted to the actions by NATO be claiming that the Northern Atlantic alliance \nwas using the crisis in Ukraine to  \"resuscitate itself.\"\n\nFragile truce established and quickly violated in eastern Ukraine:\n\nMeanwhile, as NATO enacted the aforementioned measures, negotiations were going on between Ukraine and pro-\nRussian separatists in Belarus to try to forge a ceasefire.  Ironically, the ceasefire was being negotiated at a time \nwhen clashes were taking place in Donetsk and Mariupol.\n\nAround the same time as the ceasefire negotiations were ongoing, the European Union was preparing fresh \nsanctions. The new measures included restrictions on the ability of Russian state-owned oil companies to raise \nmoney in European financial markets. Russia's so-called \"leading\"  oil company, Rosneft, as well as as Gazprom \nNeft, the oil component of the Gazprom natural gas monopoly, and the Transneft  pipeline operator would all be \naffected; on the other hand, the natural gas sector was left out of this tranche of measures. The new sanctions also \nexpanded on existing visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials and pro-Russian activists in Ukraine. The \ntiming of the implementation of the sanctions was left vague -- presumably to give time for a ceasefire to take \neither take root of dissolve.\n\nNote that later in September 2014, the United States also expanded its sanctions against Russia. The United \nStates' moves targeted oil and defense industries, while intensifying sanctions that have limited access of major \nRussian banks to United States debt and equity markets. (Of note was the fact that the financial sanctions targeted \nRussia's Sberbank.)\n\nMeanwhile, on Sept. 5, 2014 after five months of fighting, thanks to the negotiations brokered by the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the two sides were able to sign on to a truce in Belarus.  The \nagreement, known as the Minsk Agreement, did not expressly deal with the positions of Ukrainian authorities and \npro-Russian separatists -- namely, Kiev's right to holding onto its territorial integrity, or the separatists' breakaway \naspirations.  Still, the truce  would bring an end to the fighting, and thus offer time for the two sides to work out a \nroadmap of sorts for longer term regional stablity plan.  Included in the agreement were provisions for an exchange \nof prisoners of war and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor for the transporation of aid and displaced \npersons.\n\nFor his part, Ukrainian  President Poroshenko said he welcomed the ceasefire. Poroshenko said he and Russian \nPresident Putin had shared a phone call in which they agreed that \"overall the ceasefire was being implemented\" \nand that there was a need to make it more durable.  Poroshenko noted, \"It is very important that this ceasefire lasts \nlong, and during this ceasefire we continue the political dialogue to bring peace and stability.\" Both President \nPoroshenko and United States President Barack Obama noted that the ceasefire was accompished, at least \npartially, because of the sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2014, despite the prevailing ceasefire, pro-Russian separatists fired artillery at Ukrainian government \nforces close to the city of Mariupol.  For several days leading up to the ceasefire, pro-Russian separatists had been \ntargeting the strategic port city.  Now, irrespective of the ceasefire,  Mariupol -- which was under Ukrainian control -- \nwas emerging as the new flashpoint city and one that could very well derail the new ceasefire agreement. For the \nrebels, it seemed that taking control over Mariupol, which was located on the highway to Crimea, was a strategic \ngoal for pro-Russian separatists.  However, for Ukraine,  there was a high priority on holding that city and not \nceding any further territory to Russia and pro-Russian separatists. Given Ukraine's determination to hold Mariupol, \nPresident Poroshenko himself traveled to the strategic city, where he promised that Mariupol would be reinforced \nand defended, and that any separatist attempt to advance on the city would be met with a \"crushing defeat.\"\n\nAs of Sept. 7, 2014, less than two days after the establishment of the truce, shelling continued in Mariupol  and at \nleast one death had  been reported there.  Meanwhile, sporadic clashes were also being reported in rebel-held \nDonetsk.  The Red Cross said shelling in Luhansk prevented the movement of humanitarian aid vehicles.\n\nAs the next few days went on, there were further sporadic violations of the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine.  The area \nof the Malaysian Airlines crash as a result of a pro-Russian missile continued to be a conflict zone.  There was also \nan increasingly complex scenario unfolding in the region of eastern Ukraine with the arrival of Chechen fighters \neager to exact \"revenge\" on Russia and Russian fighters.\n\nThat being said, in keeping with the ceasefire agreement, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine released 1,200 \nprisoners.  As well, Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that most of the Russian forces that had penetrated \nUkrainian territory had been withdrawn. He said, \"According to the latest information I have received from our \nintelligence, 70 percent of Russian troops have been moved back across the border.\" Now, it should be noted that \nRussia has never actually admitted that its forces violated Ukraine's sovereignty irrespective of the evidence to the \ncontrary.  That being said, as noted by President Poroshenko, \"This further strengthens our hope that the peace \ninitiatives have good prospects.\"\n\nOn the other side of the border, Russia also lauded the truce -- as fragile as it might be.  According to the Kremlin, \nRussian President Vladimir Putin was satisfied that the ceasefire was still in place several days later after its \nestablishment.\n\nUkrainian parliament grants more autonomy to the East; Minsk peace plan laid out  --\n\nWith an eye on the future, Ukrainian President Poroshenko laid out a plan for the future of Ukraine that would \npreserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity, while offering greater autonomy to the eastern part of the country \nunder an uprising from pro-Russian separatists.\n\nPresident Poroshenko  noted that his proposal was consistent with the provisions of the ceasefire agreement that \nwas forged in Belarus.  He said, \"The Minsk protocol envisages the restoration and preservation of Ukrainian \nsovereignty on all the territory of the Donbass (in eastern Ukraine), including that controlled by the fighters.\"\n\nBy mid-September 2014, the parliament of Ukraine passed legislation granting greater autonomy to the two \nflashpoint areas of eastern Ukraine -- Donetsk and Luhansk - for a three year period.  As well, the legislation \ngranted amnesty to pro-Russian separatist in those two regions. It should be noted that the amnesty provision \nwould not apply to separatists believed to have committed grave crimes, such as the shooting down of the \nMalaysian Airline passenger plane carrying mostly Dutch citizens.\n\nIt was not clear that eastern Ukraine separatists would accept these gestures.  Indeed,  a pro-Russian leader from \nDonetsk, Andrei Purgin, as quoted as  saying, \"Ukraine is free to adopt any law it wants. But we are not planning \nany federalism with Ukraine.\" It was apparent that for many separatists,  their notion of creating a new independent \nstate known as \"Novorossiya\" remained the central goal.\n\n\n\nAs September 2014 entered its final week, the government of Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists met for peace \ntalks in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.  There, in the city where the initial ceasefire was announced at the start of \nthe month, more details were furnished regarding the path forward to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWhile the ceasefire has continued to endure intermittent violations, it remained in effect.  This agreement at the end \nof September 2014, however, was intended to add more detail to the ceasefire deal, with an eye on ensuring it \nwould be a sustainable plan for regional stability.\n\nThe agreement included provisions for the establishment of a buffer zone, the removal of heavy artillery from the \nfront lines, a ban on overflights by military aircraft in the newly-established security zone, a ban on offensive \noperations, and the  withdrawal of \"foreign mercenaries\" on both sides from the conflict zone.  Also included in the \nplan was the implementation of an OSCE monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine. Left outside of the agreement, \naccording to separatist leader, Alexander Zakharchenko, was the status of Luhansk and Donetsk.  He said, \"We \nhave our opinion on it while Ukraine has its own.\"\n\nIn fact, as noted above, the parliament of Ukraine passed legislation granting self-determination and greater \nautonomy to  Donetsk and Luhansk for a three-year period, thus garnering the condemnation of Ukrainian \nnationalists.  But even those measures were regarded as insufficient by pro-Russian separatists who continued to \ndemand a fully independent state (known as \"Novorossiya\" as noted above).\n\nIn another complication, Ukraine  was soon refusing to pull back from the front lines in  eastern Ukraine and, \ninstead, calling for a new buffer zone deal.  Ukraine said it would not withdraw its forces until the ceasefire was fully \nimplemented, with  Andriy Lysenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, noting \nthat two government soldiers had been killed, at least eight others had been injured, and pro-Russian separatists  \nhad fired at Ukrainian government forces in 22 different locations \u2013 and all  within 24 hours of the signing the Minsk \nagreement.  He emphasized that the pro-Russian separatists were hardly abiding by the terms of the deal, thus \nUkraine's decision to hold its positions.\n\nUkraine's stance was backed by NATO with top military commander United States General Philip Breedlove \ncharging that the ceasefire of Sept. 5, 2014, existed \"in name only.\"\n\nUkrainian parliament ratifies deal with EU; President Poroshenko unveils reforms aimed at securing EU accession  -\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine strengthened its relationship with the West when the parliament ratified an Association \nAgreement with the European Union.  It was the Association Agreement that sparked the Ukrainian uprising in the \nfirst place, when now-ousted former President Yanukovych decided to shelve the pact in favor of a customs \nagreement with Russia.  Now, after an uprising, an annexation of Crimea, a war, and a fatal plane crash, not to \nmention the loss of countless lives, the Association Agreement had returned to the fore.\n\nThis move was likely to upset Moscow, which has throughout been dismayed about Ukraine slipping out of its orbit. \nThe ratification of the Association Agreement quite literally underlined the passage of Ukraine from Russia's realm \nto the European sphere. The price paid in blood for this movement from east to west was illustrated by President \nPoroshenko's words: \"No nation has ever paid such a high price to become Europeans.\"\n\nThat thrust to become European was accelerated on Sept. 25, 2014, with Ukrainian President Poroshenko unveiling \na package of social and economic reforms aimed at  ultimately securing accession to the European Union.  \nSpeaking of the package, he said, \"This program foresees about 60 reforms and special programs that will allow \nUkraine to prepare for submitting in six years a bid for membership of the European Union.\"\n\nPutin calls for  withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian border; Poroshenko strengthens defense posture --\n\n\n\nIn the first part of October 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to withdraw  from their \npositions along the Ukrainian border and return to their permanent bases.  While the news was welcomed, Western \npowers warned that they would not take the announcement as a genuine commitment  until they saw actual \nevidence of the announced withdrawal from the border.  Of course, the fact of the matter was that most Western \npowers also believed that Russian forces remained across the border in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt should be noted that the call by Putin  to withdraw Russian troops from the border occurred in the  aftermath of \nmilitary exercises that took place in the region of  Rostov region.  The move was being regarded as a cautiously \noptimistic  sign that tensions between Russia and Ukraine were easing to some degree.\n\nThis lessening of tension came at an opportune time -- ahead of a meeting between Russian President Putin and \nUkrainian President Poroshenko set to take place in mid-October 2014 in Italy on the sidelines of a scheduled \nsummit of Asian and European leaders.  With that summit underway, however, there was no sign that the two \nleaders had made any significant strides.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Poroshenko moved to strengthen the  defense system of his country.  At issue was \nhis appointment of National Guard Chief Stepan Poltorak as the new defense minister and the ensuing ratification \nof that move by the parliament.  Poltorak would replace Valery Heletey, who faced scathing criticism for his military \nleadership against Russian-backed separatists in August 2014. A series of defeats during that period around \nDonetsk compelled the newly-elected President Poroshenko to back away from a military mission to defeat  the pro-\nRussian separatists in the east, and instead move towards the negotiating table.\n\nWhile peace negotiations remained a priority for the Ukrainian leadership, President Poroshenko wanted to \nstrengthen his military infrastructure.  To that end, Poroshenko was looking towards the appointment of the well-\nrespected Poltorak at the helm of the defense ministry as one who would be well-positioned to \"create a powerful \nsystem of defense for Ukraine.\"\n\nAs October 2014 was coming to a close,  that defense strategy remained a key consideration given NATO's \nwarning that Russian troops remained in eastern Ukraine and had substantial forces ammassed on the border, \ndespite claims of a withdrawal (mentioned just above). NATO's new Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, the \nformer leader of Norway,  said of Russia and Russian forces: \"They are still violating the sovereignty and the \nterritorial integrity of Ukraine by having Russian forces in Ukraine.\"\n\nUnited States Air Force General Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander,  said in an interview with \ninternational media,  \"We've seen a pretty good withdrawal of the Russian forces from inside Ukraine but, make no \nmistake, there remain Russian forces inside eastern Ukraine.\"  Breedlove continued, \"But the force that remains \nand shows no indications of leaving is still a very, very capable force.\"  Breedlove noted that the continued \npresence of a \"large coercive force\" on the Ukraine border was not conducive to the implementation of the Minsk \nceasefire  agreement, and a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from inside Ukraine and along the border with \nUkraine would be needed to take Russian commitments to peace seriously.\n\nThe only bright spot in the realm of Russian-Ukrainian relations was forging of a short-term agreement at the start \nof November 2014, which was  aimed at securing Russian gas for Ukrainian use through the duration of the winter.\n\nElections and effects on Russian-Ukrainian relations --\n\nIn the last week of October 2014, Ukrainians went to the polls to vote in parliamentary elections. Ukrainian \nPresident Poroshenko  was looking for allies to be elected to the parliament in the elections so he would gain \nlegislative support and a mandate for his aforementioned defense strategy against pro-Russians in the east.  The \npresident was also looking for an endorsement from the citizenry for his Westward push for the country, as he \nadvocated Ukraine's closer ties with Europe, and ultimately, accession to the European Union.  President \n\n\n\nPoroshenko  received that mandate on election day (Oct. 26, 2014), following a strong showing at the polls by his \nown party, and other pro-European and allied nationalist  parties.  As such, President Poroshenko was well-\npositioned to move forward not only with his security agenda, but also with his pro-Europe moves.\n\nBut at the start of November 2014, the eastern portion of Ukraine (which had not participated in parliamentary \nelections mentioned here due to separatist inclinations) was moving forward with illegal elections of their own.  The \nbig winners of the vote in the pro-Russian east were  Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky  who respectively \nclaimed victory as the new leaders of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" of \"new Russia.\"\n\nAs expected, these results of these elections that took place on Nov. 2, 2014, were rejected by Ukraine and the \nlarger international community, while (unsurprisingly) being backed by Russia.\n\nIn a move sure to heighten tensions between the two countries, Russia made clear that it would recognize the \nresults of the elections of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry blasted \nRussia for this decision, declaring in a statement: \"The Kremlin is consciously making the situation worse ... In such \nan extraordinarily fragile situation, this is an irresponsible step by Russia which can threaten the peace process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration in the United States made clear to Kiev that it would not recognize any \nelections held in areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of pro-Russian separatists.  Likewise, the governments \nof other Western countries, including Germany and France, made it clear that the vote in eastern Ukraine would be \ntreated as illegitimate.\n\nThe vote among pro-Russian separtists in eastern Ukraine prompted Ukrainian President Poroshenko to act in the \npolitical arena.  He called on the newly-elected parliament of Ukraine to repeal the law that was passed granting \ngreater autonomy for the separatists regions.  That legislation moved forward despite the objections of nationalists \nfor the purpose of advancing peace, and as an act of good faith in the Minsk ceasefire process.  However, the \nelections in eastern Ukraine constituted a flagrant violation of the spirit of the peace process.  There was now no  \nreason for the Ukrainian president to go against his nationalist allies in parliament to appease separatists in the east \nwho clearly had no intention of being appeased.\n\nOn the ground in eastern Ukraine, the situation appeared to be devolving. At issue was the flare of renewed \nviolence between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists  in eastern Ukraine, with  shelling \nintensifying around Donetsk, the main separatist stronghold.  President Poroshenko addressed the  shelling \nbetween government forces and pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, saying that \nthere was no need to panic.  He explained, \"If events begin to unravel in spite of the peace plan, Ukrainian armed \nforces today are ready and capable of repelling.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government of Ukraine in Kiev said that there was mounting evidence of continued Russian support \nfor the separatists in the east, in clear violation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement.  Of note was the fact that the pro-\nRussian separatists  received fresh stored of  ammunition and other military equipment.\n\nThe Kiev government also accused Russia of sending mercenaries to the front lines in the east and further charged \nthat there had been Russian incursions into its territory. Kiev authorities said that a column of tanks and troops \ncrossed the border from Russia and crossed into eastern Ukraine in the first week of November 2014.  This claim \nwas backed by observations reported by both the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe as well as \nReuters News correspondents. Radio Free Europe also pointed out that there was no shortage of videotaped clips \nof the convoy available on the Internet.\n\nFor its part, Russia denied the accusations despite the evidence to the contrary.  Nevertheless, Ukraine was \ndeploying reinforcements to the region in response to apparent threats of Russian aggression.  The truth of the \nmatter was that the movement of troops from both sides on the Ukraininan-Russian border suggested that Ukraine \nand Russian-supported separatists were preparing for renewed conflict.\n\n\n\nIn many senses the fragile ceasefire agreement discussed above was on the brink of collapse.  As noted by United \nStates Air Force General Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander,  the conditions were clearly in \nplace for  a so-called \"frozen conflict\" between Greater Ukraine under the control of Kiev and the pro-Russian east \nunder the protection of Moscow.  Still, with heavy bombardment and shelling of rebel-held Donetsk in the second \nweek of November 2014, and with reports of a build-up of pro-Russian reinforcements in eastern Ukraine, it was fair \nto say that the conflict retained many traits of a \"hot\" war.\n\nIndeed, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said on Nov. 14, 2014, that the top priority for his country would \nbe to strengthen the army so it would be able to stop Russian aggression.  Days later, he also dismissed Russian \ncalls that Ukraine engage in direct talks with separatists leaders, making clear that his government would take no \naction aimed at legitimizing \"terrorists.\"\n\nInternational Relations --\n\nGiven this landscape, it was perhaps not surprising that the West was telegraphing no end to the sanctions against \nRussia.  In fact, the European Union was hinting that it might intensify its sanctions regime against Russia given the \nclear violations of the Minsk Agreement.\n\nAt the G20 summit in Australia in mid-November 2014, Western leaders placed pressure on Russian President \nPutin for continued backing of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.  In one particularly marked exchange, \nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said: \"I guess I'll shake your hand but I have only one thing to say to you: \nYou need to get out of Ukraine.\"  According to Reuters News, Putin's response contained the same kind of \nmendacious denial that has come to characterize Russia's official stance on Ukraine. Putin said: \"Unfortunately, this \nis impossible to do because we are not there.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama noted that the United States was leading the charge of \"opposing Russia's aggression \nagainst Ukraine, which is a threat to the world, as we saw in the appalling shoot-down of MH17.\" (MH17 was the \nMalaysian airliner shot down by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in July 2014.)\n\nThe United States was joined by Australia and Japan in issuing a joint statement expressing solidarity in \"opposing \nRussia's purported annexation of Crimea and its actions to destabilize eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nEven outside the summit, the mood was distinctly anti-Putinesque, with  protesters accusing the Russian leader of \nmurder, while others wore headbands with the words \"Putin, Killer\" emblazoned on them  The summit thus \nhighlighted Putin's isolation and estrangement from the rest of the world's leading nation states.\n\nUltimately, Putin left the summit early, returning to Russia before other G20 leaders had completed their sidebar \nmeetings. He explained his early departure as follows: \"It will take nine hours to fly to Vladivostok and another eight \nhours to get Moscow. I need four hours sleep before I get back to work on Monday. We have completed our \nbusiness.\"  However, the general consensus was that the Russian leader was likely departing the summit in order \nto avoid further unpleasant exchanges with world leaders.\n\nGiven his alienation from the world's leading Western nation states, Putin was looking for new allies.  To that end, \nhe was hoping to improve Russian ties with the paranoid and pariah nation state of North Korea.  The leaders of the \ntwo countries were apparently interested in working together to improve regional security.  With a United Nations \nresolution in the offing regarding North Korea's human rights violations and possible action at the International \nCriminal Court, no doubt Pyongyang was looking to cultivate a better relationship with a veto-wielding country (other \nthan China) on the United Nations Security Council.\nMeanwhile, Moscow was on the hunt for new friends.\n\nStatus Update\n\n\n\nIn  December 2014, fighting had intensified at the Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine - a violation of the Minsk \nceasefire agreement. The government of Ukraine accused Russia of providing special operatives to bolster support \nfor the pro-Russian separatists there, as well as of smuggling heavy artillery ammunition into its territory.\n\nWith the fighting going on irrespective of the Minsk agreement, and with signs of continued Russian involvement in \neastern Ukraine, the United States and the European Union telegraphed that they would be working to intensifying \ntheir sanctions against Russia, while simultaneously working to shore up European energy security. One measure \nin that direction would be the export of United States  liquefied natural gas  to Europe to diversify supplies on the \nother side of the Atlantic. To date, Europe has been concerned that tougher sanctions against Russia would create \nnegative consequences, given that region's reliance  on Russian energy supplies.  United States President Barack \nObama urged patience in regards to the sanctions against Russia, noting that it would take some time before \nRussian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy choices would ultimately create economic pain for Russia, which \nwould have to be transposed into domestic political pressure before Putin  could be persuaded to change course.  \nWith an eye on creating that economic pain, in the third week of December 2014, President Obama said that he \nhad signed onto a new Russian sanctions bill that had been signed by the United States Congress.\n\nAs December 2014 drew to a close, there was a prisoner exchange between the Ukrainian government and pro-\nRussian separatists.  This action was regarded to be a positive step in tamping down the tensions in eastern \nUkraine, and may have been - at least partially - driven by economic pressures on Russia due to the combination of \nlower oil prices and economic sanctions imposed by the West.\n\nAround the same period of late 2014, Ukrainian President Poroshenko said he intended to meet with his Russian, \nFrench, and German counterparts on Jan. 15, 2015, in the Kazakh capital of Astana for discussions on the \nrestoration of peace in the eastern part of the country -- now a hotbed of pro-Russian separatist activity.  \nPoroshenko described the priority for the meeting as follows: \"The most important thing is to turn a fragile ceasefire \ninto a stable peace and return previously occupied territories under the control of Ukrainian authorities.\" That \nimperative could prove difficult because Ukraine regarded its territorial integrity and sovereignty to be of paramount \nimportance while Russia was unlikely to cede control of Crimea back to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, on the domestic political landscape in Ukraine, a new government was approved by parliament in the \naftermath of the parliamentary elections.  The new cabinet, led by Prime Minister  Arseny Yatseniuk, included \ntechnocrats and made clear that no major shifts in policy were in the offing.\n\nIn the realm of foreign policy, on Dec. 23, 2014, Ukraine's westward drift was emphasized when President \nPoroshenko signed legislation revoking Ukraine's status as a neutral country.  The bill, which nullified Ukraine's \nofficial \"non-aligned\" status, effectively  set the path towards the pursuit of NATO membership at some point in the \nfuture.  It was a move sure to raise the ire of Russia, which has opposed Ukraine's alliances with Western \nmultilateral powers, such as the European Union and NATO.\n\nNot surprisingly, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed disapproval for these latest developments, \ncasting the decision to revoke Ukraine's neutrality as \"counter-productive\" and warning that it would only amplify \nregional tensions.  But Ukraine was undeterred; Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin noted Ukraine was determined to \nintensify its alliances with Europe and the West. He said: \"This will lead to integration in the European and the Euro-\nAtlantic space.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the entire crisis in the region was precipitated by Russia's desire to prevent Ukraine from \naligning more closely with the European Union.  Now, in the aftermath of Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine, \nincluding the annexation of Crimea, not only was Ukraine looking to join the European Union, but it was also looking \npotentially towards NATO, which Russia has long regarded as a threat to its power in the region.  In truth, NATO \nwas not necessarily interested in having Ukraine join its body; however, Ukraine's ambitions along these lines were \n\n\n\nlikely enough to enrage Russia and imperil prevailing efforts to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.  Of note was \nRussian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's Facebook post warning that Ukraine's rejection of neutrality augured \n\"negative consequences.\"  He posted, \"In essence, an application for NATO membership will turn Ukraine into a \npotential military opponent for Russia.\"\n\nIn January 2015, there was no end in sight as to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. In fact, fighting was still going on at \nthe international airport in Donetsk. As noted by a presidential adviser, Yuri Biryukov, via the social media outlet, \nFacebook: \"They (the separatists) launched a full storm from this morning. We have wounded on our side. There is \nhot combat going on there and the tension and the situation there is the worst I have seen.\"  Not surprisingly,  \nattempts to revive peace talks had ended in failure and the prevailing Minsk ceasefire agreement could be regarded \nas effectively defunct.  But in some good news for Ukraine, on Jan. 19, 2015, their forces were successfully able to \nregain control over the Donetsk airport and the surrounding territory in eastern Ukraine, which had been lost to the \npro-Russian separatists over the course of weeks.  Ukrainian military spokesperson,  Andriy Lysenko, said, \"We \nsucceeded in almost completely cleansing the territory of the airport, which belongs to the territory of Ukrainian \nforces as marked by military separation lines.\"\n\nWith Russia increasing its support of the separatists in the east, the Ukrainian parliament in mid-January 2015 \nvoted affirmatively to rotate its forces on the front lines and resume conscription into its military. Oleksander \nTurchynov, secretary of the national defense council, said in an address to parliament that 8,500 Russian regular \nforces were now deployed in eastern Ukraine.  He said, \"Russian aggression is continuing. There has been a \nsignificant surge in the intensity of firing.\"  He also made note of the fact that Ukrainian positions were fired on more \nthan 100 times in mid-January 2015, and that several Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, while even more had \nbeen wounded.\n\nIn addition, 12 civilians died at an army checkpoint due to shelling of a passenger bus. Thus the need for Ukraine to \nbe ready to respond militarily.  To this end, Turchynov said, \"There is an urgent need to strengthen the combat and \nmobilization readiness of our forces and other military forces up to a level which guarantees an adequate reaction \nto threats to national security from continuing Russian aggression.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with Russia continuing to play a central role in the eastern Ukrainian crisis (despite claims to the \ncontrary), the West made clear that there would be no easing of sanctions, and the alienation of Russia would \ncontinue.  To that end, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was to host the next meeting of G7 countries, made \nit clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not be invited to the summit of the world's economic super-\npowers. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Merkel said, \"The G7 and former G8 \ngroup has always viewed itself as a community of values. The annexation of Crimea, which is a blatant violation of \nthe principles of international law, and the events in eastern  Ukraine are serious violations of these common \nvalues.\"  She explained that, as a result, there was \"no chance\" that the Russian president would be invited to \nattend the summit in Bavaria scheduled to take place in June 2015.  Merkel also noted that given Russia's \ncontinued aggression, sanctions would remain in place as she said, \"In spring we will discuss the question how to \ndeal with the sanctions that we decided to impose after Russia's annexation of Crimea.  Given the current situation, \nthey will remain in place.\" Accordingly, Russia's pariah status remained unchanged.\n\nIn the third week of January 2015, pro-Russian separatists were able to send Ukrainian forces into retreat from the \nDonetsk airport where a lengthy battle had been ongoing for weeks.  However, Ukrainian President  Poroshenko \ninsisted that despite that obvious setback due to an intensified effort from the pro-Russian rebels,  his country's \ntroops were holding the line.  He said, \"Across all front lines we are firmly holding our positions.\"  Still, there were \ncasualties with at least 10 Ukrainian soldiers being killed in the period of the third week of January 2015.  There \nwas also a trolleybus attack in Donetsk that left eight civilians dead, which both sides blamed on one another.\n\nAround the same period, NATO released a report noting that in violation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement, fighting \nin separatist territories was actually more intense than it had been prior to the ceasefire being announced in \nSeptember 2014. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said the increased violence and bloodshed should be \n\n\n\nblamed on pro-Russian separatists, who were being supported by Moscow despite Russian President Putin's claim \nto the contrary.  For his part, Putin appeared determined to sow the seeds of mischief as he suggested that, in fact, \nNATO troops were fighting alongside Ukrainian forces.  NATO dismissed this claim by the Russian president as \nludicrous.\n\nPro-Russian separatist aggression was highlighted on Jan. 23, 2015, when Alexander Zakharchenko, the head of \nthe self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, dismissed the notion of further peace talks with the government of \nukraine in Kiev, saying  his forces would instead launch a new offensive into the eastern regions not yet under \nseparatists' control.\n\nMaking good on this threat, on Jan. 24, 2015, pro-Russian separatists launched an offensive against the strategic \nport city of Mariupol located on the Sea of Azov.  The  city administration of Mariupol  said the pro-Russian \nseparatists fired rockets using long-range GRAD missile systems,  killing at least 30 people and injuring scores \nmore. In an interview with Russia's RIA news agency proudly took responsibility for his rebels' attack on Mariupol \nsaying it was intended to avenge the deaths of his people.  He said, \"Today an offensive was launched on Mariupol. \nThis will be the best possible monument to all our dead.\" He added that his separatists fighters intended to target \nthe town of Debaltseve, to the northeast of Donetsk, next in its war campaign.\n\nAt home in Kiev, President  Poroshenko promised to protect Ukrainian's territorial sovereignty and convened an \nemergency meeting of his country's security council on Jan. 25, 2015.  He issued a statement that read as follows: \n\"We are for peace, but we accept the challenge of the enemy. We will protect our motherland.\"\n\nAs January 2015 came to a close, scores of people were killed as fighting raged on between Ukrainian troops and \npro-Russian separatists in  eastern Ukraine. The pro-Russians were now penetrating the town of Debaltseve, \nconsolidating pre-Russian separatist control of the region.\n\nAlso in late January 2015, cracks began to form in the normally strong Russia-Belarus alliance.  With Russia \nbacking pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and annexing  Crimea a year earlier,  Belarus -- like many of \nRussia's neighbors -- was suddenly wary of Russia's imperial ambitions, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's \napparent hopes to reconstitute the Soviet empire.  Once one of Russia's closest allies in the region, Belarus was \nsuddenly shifting its stance with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declaring in vociferous language that \nhis country would  never be part of the \"Russian world\" -- a term adopted by the Russian Kremlin as Moscow seeks \nto draw its former republics back under its umbrella.\n\nIt should be noted that Belarus has played a key regional role in the Ukrainian crisis, hosting talks that led to the \n(now collapsed) Minsk ceasefire agreement of 2014.  But as Russia has sought to extend  a controlling hand over \nBelarus' assets, the Belarusian president was keen to draw the proverbial line in the sand.  For Belarus, suspicion \nof Russia was sparked when Moscow tried to retrict exports in violation of the regulations ensconced within the  \nEurasian Economic Union, which includes Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.  Belarus warned \nthat if the rules of the Eurasian Economic Union were not observed, it would withdraw from the alliance.\n\nPresident Lukashenko made it clear that Belarus' independence would have to be respected as he declared, \n\"Those who think that the Belarusian land is part as what they call the Russian world, almost part of Russia, forget \nabout it!\" He continued, \"Belarus is a modern and independent state.\" Lukashenko went one step further, noting \nthat he wished to normalize ties with the West. It was a move certain to infuriate Moscow, which seeks the opposite \noutcome.  However, as Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine exists, it has stood as  reminder to surrounding \ncountries of their own vulnerability, and concomitantly driven stalwart allies, such as Belarus, in a Westward \ndirection.\n\nBy the start of February 2015, fighting in the Ukrainian east was fierce and the death toll was increasing around the \ntransport hub of Debaltseve,  while pro-Russian rebels had not only advanced on the nearby town of  Vuhlehirsk.  \n\n\n\nIndeed, on Feb. 4, 2015, pro-Russian rebels appeared to be in full control of the garrison town.  The fall of \nVuhlehirsk was a clear blow to the Ukrainian government in Kiev.\n\nSurrounding towns were also suffering the effects of heavy shelling with residents of Avdiivka saying that large \nswaths of that town had been completely destroyed.\n\nIt was a clear fact that fighting in eastern Ukraine had escalated at an alarming level in the first part of February \n2015, prompting the United Nations to warn that the violence was reaching \"catastrophic\" levels with civilian \ncasualties on a marked increase.  Flashpoints included the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the town of \nDebaltseve.  United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein,  said there had been a \"clear breach of \ninternational humanitarian law which governs the conduct of armed conflicts.\"  To this end, he noted that public \nvenues, such as bus stops, marketplaces, schools, and hospitals had become battlegrounds.\n\nMeanwhile, talks in Belarus aimed at reviving  truce ended in failure.  Ukraine's representative,  former Ukrainian \nPresident Leonid Kuchma, said the negotiations were  \"thwarted\" by the actions of pro-Russian rebels.  The \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which took part in the talks in Minsk, along with \nenvoys from Ukraine and Russia, shared the view that pro-Russian rebels had sabotaged the peace negotiations.  \nThe OSCE said that pro-Russian separatists were simply not interested in serious discussions pertaining to a peace \nplan.  Furthermore, as noted in an OSCE statement: \"In fact, they [pro-Russian separatists]  were not even \nprepared to discuss implementation of a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons.\"\n\nGiven this  landscape, as well as the increase in Russian-aided aggression on Ukrainian territory, the West was \nwarning of consequences to come.  Speaking from a state visit in India, United States President Barack Obama \nsaid his country was looking at a wealth of options, just short of military action, to isolate Russia. He said, \"We are \ndeeply concerned about the latest break in the ceasefire and the aggression that these separatists -- with Russian \nbacking, Russian equipment, Russian financing, Russian training and Russian troops -- are conducting.  I will look \nat all additional options that are available to us short of military confrontation and try to address this issue. And we \nwill be in close consultation with our international partners, particularly European partners.\"\n\nThe European Union convened an emergency meeting of foreign ministers, headed by the European Union foreign \naffairs chief, Federica Mogherini. But the sharpest language came from the  new leader of the European Council,  \nFormer Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who delivered harsh rebuke not only of Russian aggression, but of \nEurope's response to it.  Tusk conjured up memories of World War II, as he condemned the \"appeasement\"  of \nMoscow.  Via the social media outlet, Twitter, he said: \"Once again, appeasement encourages the aggressor to \ngreater acts of violence. Time to step up our policy based on cold facts, not illusions.\"  Ultimately, the European \nUnion opted to extend the sanctions regime against Russia in response to continued Russian aggression and \nsupport for separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDebate over arming Ukraine --\n\nOn Feb. 2, 2015, the New York Times in the United States reported that President Barack Obama was considering \nadditional support for Ukrainian forces -- possibly in the form of defensive weapons and equipment -- for the \npurpose of protecting Ukraine from the pro-Russian offensive.  United States officials said that no  decision had \nbeen made on the matter.  In fact, in an interview with CNN,  Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser to \nPresident Barack Obama, said: \"We're not going to bring the Ukrainian military into parity with Russia's military, \ncertainly not in the near future. We have to keep the perspective that the best tool that we have to apply pressure \non Russia is that economic pressure through the sanctions.\"\n\nOn Feb. 5, 2015, Ukrainian President  Poroshenko called on NATO states to provide additional weaponry to his \ncountry, saying, \"The escalation of the conflict that's happening today, the increasing number of civilian casualties, \nespecially after the terrorist attacks in Volnovakha and, Donetsk as well as the bombardment of Mariupol... should \n\n\n\nmove the alliance to provide Ukraine with more support.\"  In his interview with the publication, Die Welt, he said, \n\"(That) includes, among other things, delivering modern weapons for protection and for resisting the aggressor.\"  \nPoroshenko added that while his country aspired to peace, Ukraine nonetheless had to be defended.\n\nWhile NATO was not expected to assent to this call easily, there was nevertheless a plan afoot for the \nestablishment of new command and control NATO units in eastern Europe. According to NATO Secretary General \nJens Stoltenberg, the units would be made up of about 50 officers and would be established in  Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland. Ultimately, they would be geared to the rapid deployment of NATO \nforces in the region. It was a plan sure to cause consternation for Russia, which has eschewed NATO's footprint in \nits east European backyard.\n\nAlso on February 5,  United States Secretary of State John Kerry was in Ukraine to show solidarity with that country \nand to announce  $16.4 million in new humanitarian aid to help Ukrainians affected by the war raging in the east.  \nDuring a news conference, Secretary of State Kerry was asked if he believed Russia was active militarily in Ukraine \ndespite Russian claims to the contrary.  He referred the question to Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, \nwho said: \"It is crystal clear that (the) Russian military is on the ground...We are not fighting so-called rebels or \nguerrillas. We are fighting with the Russian regular army.\"  The Ukrainian prime minister also mocked Russia and \nits leader for denying this reality as he sarcastically declared that the only country denying Russian military boots \nare on the ground was the Russian Federation.  In a dramatic flourish,  Yatsenyuk removed his glasses and offered \nto lend them to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nSome Western think tanks were suggesting that a stronger Ukrainian military -- once capable of confronting \nRussian-backed separatists -- could help push the separatists into peace talks that they recently eschewed.  \nEmboldened by their success on the battlefield, pro-Russian rebels have become more aggressive rather than less \nso; it was conceivable that some reversals on the battlefield might make a truce look more attractive.  To this end, \nthe Atlantic Council  said that Ukraine would benefit from military aid, such as anti-armor missiles, drones, and \narmored Humvees. In a report, the Atlantic Council noted: \"A stronger Ukrainian military, with enhanced defensive \ncapabilities, will increase the prospects for negotiation of a peaceful settlement.\"\n\nOf course, the obvious counter-argument was that military aid from the West, and specifically from the United \nStates, might spur Russia to retaliate by amplifying its own military footprint in eastern Ukraine, thus escalating the \nwar.  As well, there was the political aspect, which was that the West likely preferred a united approach rather than \none by which a country was acting out of sync with NATO.  That type of disunity would certainly provide an opening \nfor Russian President Putin to exploit.\n\nIt was clear that the issue of arming the Ukrainian military was soon becoming an issue of contention within the \ncountries of the West.  At issue was German Chancellor Angela Merkel's objections to the notion of sending arms \nto Ukraine to help that country's military battle Russian-backed separatists. To this end, she said, \"I understand the \ndebate but I believe that more weapons will not lead to the progress Ukraine needs. I really doubt that.\"\n\nWhile the Obama White House remained reticent about actually moving forward on this front, key Republican \npoliticians from  the United States accused Germany of turning its back on Ukraine. Senator John McCain said, \n\"The Ukrainians are being slaughtered and we're sending them blankets and meals. Blankets don't do well against \nRussian tanks.\"\n\nSenator Lyndsey Graham added, \"At the end of the day, to our European friends, this is not working...Stand up to \nwhat is clearly a lie and a danger.\"\n\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking on behalf of the Obama administration was far more restrained in his view, \nsaying that the effort should be made to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine peacefully.  However, Biden noted \n\n\n\nthat Russian President Putin was not to be trusted, as he said, \"Too many times President Putin has promised \npeace and delivered tanks, troops and weapons.\"\n\nMeanwhile, making it clear that Ukrainian-Russian relations were at a new low, the Ukrainian government in Kiev \nintroduced new laws requiring Russians to present a passport (vis a vis internal identity documents) to enter \nUkrainian territory.\n\nUkrainian President Poroshenko reiterated his country's right to defend itself, saying, \"We are an independent \nnation and we have a right to defend our people.\" He did receive European support from Lithuanian President Dalia \nGrybauskaite, who declared that Ukraine should be supported \"with all means necessary to defend, not to attack, to \ndefend its people and its territory.\"\n\nBut the peace path was not yet abandoned.  The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France were set to \nmeet in Belarus' capital city of Minsk in the second week of Febuary 2015 to discuss a resolution to the violence in \neastern Ukraine. The proposal on the table was not actually new -- it seemed to build upon the now-defunct Minsk \nceasefire agreement of September 2014, and focus on the establishment of a 40 mile demilitarized zone around the \ncurrent front lines of the conflict.  In an act of good faith in anticipation of the Minsk meeting, the European Union \nopted to impose further sanctions against pro-Russian separatist, Russians, and key organizations, but to delay the \nproposed assets freeze and visa bans until after the peace summit had taken place.  The intent was to give the \ntalks a chance to yield results and implement them on the basis of the results of the meeting.\n\nAs noted by  French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, \"The principle of these sanctions remains but the \nimplementation will depend on results on the ground.\"\n\nMeanwhile,  German Chancellor Merkel was by-passing the  contingent of United States politicians  advocating the \narming of the Ukrainian military and, instead, conferring with the president of the United States, Barack Obama, on \nthe details of the new peace plan.  A meeting between the two heads of government was held on Feb. 9, 2015, \nahead of the Minsk meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, Russia,  and France on Feb. 11, 2015.  Speaking of the \nmeeting between Obama and Merkel, the spokesperson for the United States National Security Council, Mark \nStroh, paid tribute to the German chancellor on behalf of the United States president, saying, \"The President values \nthe Chancellor's judgement, and appreciates her strong efforts in marshalling European support and maintaining \nTransatlantic unity throughout the Ukraine crisis. She has been tireless in her pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the \ncrisis, and the President anticipates a useful and informative discussion about this and other issues.\"\n\nEven as discussions about a new ceasefire were ongoing, the reality was that pro-Russian separatists were \ninterested only in war as they prepared for fresh assaults on  Debaltseve and Mariupol.  In fact, on Feb. 8, 2015, \nreports from eastern Ukraine indicated that pro-Russian separatists were making repeated attempts to attack \ngovernment positions in Debaltseve, with massive shelling reported in that town.  The commander of a squadron \nthat captured the town of Vuhlehirsk close to Debaltseve told international media that his forces had no interest in a \ntruce.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2015, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany convened peace talks in the city of Minsk \nin Belarus.  Of note was a televised handshake between Ukrainian President Poroshenko and Russian President \nPutin.  However, the meeting was immediately overshadowed from the news in eastern Ukraine that pro-Russian \nseparatists'  assaults close to Debaltseve had left as many as 20 Ukrainian soldiers dead.  A separate incident \nresulted in the deaths of several people when a shell hit a bus station in Donetsk.\n\nNew Minsk Ceasefire Agreement --\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2015, following close to 24 hours of marathon talks, French President  Fran\u00e7ois Hollande  announced \nthat an agreement for peace in eastern Ukraine had been forged to end the fighting and ultimately stabilize the \n\n\n\nregion. The ceasefire was to go into effect at midnight on Feb. 14, 2015 (technically 00.01 on Feb. 15, 2015) and \nwas to be observed by international monitors.\n\nThere were provisions for a forthcoming concord that would end the war, and settle difficult issues such as \ndisarmament, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry,  amnesty for all fighters, prisoner exchanges, and border control.  \nThere was also a roadmap for constitutional reforms that would facilitate the decentralization of separatist-\ndominated regions of the east.  There was also the matter of self-determination in the flashpoint pro-Russian \nseparatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. As indicated here, under the terms of the concord, the territory in the \neast would be returned to Ukraine, but only after the holding of fresh elections in  Donetsk and Luhansk under the \naegis of Ukrainian law, and on the basis of the aforementioned  constitutional reforms that would deal with \ndecentralization.\n\nPresident Hollande of France hailed the truce, saying, \"It is a relief for Europe.\"  German Chancellor Merkel was \nmore restrained, saying that the ceasefire offered a \"glimmer of hope.\" President Poroshenko made initially \naccused Russia of making \"unacceptable\" demands of his country but said that Ukraine has stood strong in the \nface of \"ultimatums.\"  Russian President Putin said in an interview with Russian media, \"It wasn't the best night for \nme, but it's a good morning.\"\n\nAcross the Atlantic in the United States, the United States government noted the  \"significant step\" constituted by \nthe agreement, but pointed out that continued fighting in eastern Ukraine was \"inconsistent with the spirit of the \naccord.\"  In truth, it was to be seen if the new Minsk ceasefire agreement would end more positively than the last \none.  At issue was the ongoing fighting in Debaltseve, where pro-Russian fighters were on the offensive and \nUkrainian forces were under pressure. Would the truce be observed there?  The rebel leader of Luhansk, Igor \nPlotnitskiy, issued a more promising note, saying, \"We hope that thanks to our efforts today, Ukraine will change \nand stop firing at civilians, hospitals and socially important facilities.\" The rebel leader of Donetsk, Alexander \nZakharchenko, said the blame would be placed on Ukraine if the ceasefire collapsed,  and ominously warned that in \nthat event, there would \"be no meetings and no new agreements.\"\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2015, the new Minsk ceasefire agreement appeared to be a conceptual notion rather than a reality as \nfighting continued in some parts of eastern Ukraine. In truth, the truce did indeed seem to be in place in significant \nportions of eastern Ukraine; however, in the flashpoint town of Debaltseve where intensive fighting had gone on for \nweeks, there was no sign of peace. In fact, pro-Russian separatists who were advancing on the town and \nassaulting Ukrainian forces made clear that there would be no  ceasefire in Debaltseve.\n\nBy the third week of February 2015, Debaltseve was under pro-Russian separatist control and Ukrainian forces \nwere in retreat.  As well, Ukrainian authorities said that pro-Russian  were attacking government-held positions in \neastern Ukraine -- including the area around the strategic port of Mariupol.\n\nAnatoly Stelmach, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military, said, \"The number of attacks show the terrorists do \nnot want to completely silence their guns.\"\n\nUkrainian authorities then went further, accusing Russia of dispatching more troops and tanks to the region, \nspecifically in the direction of the town of Novoazovsk on the southern coast.  As noted by another Ukrainian \nmilitary spokesperson,  Andriy Lysenko: \"In recent days, despite the Minsk (ceasefire) agreement, military \nequipment and ammunition have been sighted crossing from Russia into Ukraine.\" Of note was the movement of 20 \nRussian tanks, 10 missile systems, and deployment of troops into the eastern Ukrainian conflict zone.  These \nmoves appeared to hint towards a new battlefront in the war, irrespective of the fact that a new ceasefire agreement \nwas supposedly in place.\n\nMeanwhile, a year after the original Maidan uprising in Kiev ousted former pro-Russian President Yanukovych from \npower, the one-year anniversary was marked by a somber remembrance in the capital of the lives and territory lost \n\n\n\nas Ukraine has sought to hold onto its sovereignty in the face of pro-Russian aggression and imperialistic \nexpansion.\n\nBut on Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, the situation took a dark turn as citizens marked the occasion. On \nFeb. 22, 2015,  a bomb exploded at a rally  for national unity near the city's Palace of Sport, killing two people and \ninjuring 10 more.  Four individuals with alleged ties to Russia were detained in connection with the attack.  The \nreality was that Ukraine was still being plagued by conflict despite the latest Minsk ceasefire agreement.  Ukrainian \nPresident  Poroshenko characterized the attack as \"a bold attempt to expand the territory of terrorism\" and vowed \nthat justice would be served.\n\nAs February 2015 came to a close, pro-Russian separatists  attempted to win the public relations debate over who \nwas responsible for the latest Minsk ceasefire not taking hold, as they invited journalists to witness the withdrawal of \nheavy weapons from the eastern Ukrainian front line.  Ukrainian authorities dismissed the move, saying that the \ngesture was intended to obfuscate the reality that the pro-Russian were simply preparing for a fresh offensive.\n\nNevertheless, the fact of the matter was that in eastern Ukraine at the end of February 2015 was marked by  \nincreasing calm. Of course, it was quite possible that pro-Russians were willing to ease up on the fighting now that \nthe railway hub of Debaltseve was under their control.  Regardless of the actual cause for the slowing activity in the \nbattlefield, it was to be seen if this sense of calm would prove sustainable.\n\nIn the third week of March 2015, amidst the ongoing -- but fragile -- ceeasefire agreement, fighting was reported in \nDonetsk.  Of concern was the Spartak district of the city which has seen no cessation of hostilities since the time of \nthe announcement of the new Minsk ceasefire deal.  Still, the rest of the region was enjoying some calm, albeit of \nan uneasy variety.\n\nWestern leaders have said that more resources would be needed for monitors to oversee the truce, while warning \nof further sanctions, should Russian-backed separatists advance further into Ukrainian territory.\n\nIndeed, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that any significant violation of the new -- but fragile -- \nceasefire in eastern Ukraine would spur Europe to move forward with further sanctions against Russia for its \nsupport of pro-Russian separatists.  She said, \"So far we've got a fragile ceasefire which needs to be stabilized. But \nif the Minsk agreement is seriously violated, European leaders and the (European) Commission stand ready to \nprepare and impose further sanctions.\"\n\nThen, in the last week of March 2015, leaders of European Union countries said that they intended to link the lifting \nof economic sanctions on Russia with the full implementation of a Ukraine ceasefire agreement.  According to the \npresident of the  European Council, Donald Tusk, \"The duration of economic sanctions will be clearly linked to the \nfull implementation of the Minsk agreement. We have to maintain our sanctions until the Minsk agreement is fully \nimplemented.\"  This stance made clear that while the European Union was not officially extending its sanctions \nregime, which was due to expire in mid-2015, without clear benchmarks being met as regards the implementation of \na sustainable peace in eastern Ukraine, sanctions would, in fact, be continued.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom announced it would deploy military forces to Ukraine to help train that country's \nmilitary in the fight against Russian-backed rebels aiming to establish a \"new Russia.\"\n\nIn the first part of April 2015, there was a flare of violence in eastern Ukraine.  In the aftermath of the death of one \nUkrainian soldier and the wounding of several others, Ukraine accused Russian-backed separatists of using \nweapons, such as heavy weapons and artillery, that were banned under the terms of the Minsk ceasefire \nagreement. As stated by a Ukrainian military spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, \"The rebels have not stopped \nfiring at Ukrainian positions ... Over the past day, the enemy has used weapons banned under the Minsk \n\n\n\nagreements.\" On the other side of the equation, Russian-backed separatists blamed Ukrainian attacks on the \ninjuring of two journalists close to the flashpoint city of Donetsk.\n\nAs the spike in violence ensued in eastern Ukraine, foreign ministers from Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany \nheld talks and agreed to move forward with a plan to remove  weaponry from the frontlines of the conflict.  The list \nof items targeted for withdrawal included heavy caliber weapons, mortars, tanks, and  armored vehicles.\n\nNote:\n\nTo date, as many as 5,000 people have died in a year of war marked by violence and bloodshed.\n\nCould Russian encroachment into Ukraine be part of an economic plot?\n\nIn a separate development in late February 2015,  the Russian independent newspaper, Novaya Gazeta,  published \nan apparent strategy document showing  Russian plans to annex Crimea and integrate other portions of eastern \nUkraine. The plan was supposedly presented to the leadership in the Russian Kremlin leaders in early February \n2014 --  a period preceding the ousting of  pro-Russian President Yanukovych  from power in Ukraine and \nsuggestive of an entrenched imperative to get Ukraine under the de facto control of Moscow.  Novaya Gazeta \ncharacterized the document as  an \"analytical note\" that outlined the economic failures of the Yanukovych regime \nand the costs to continued support from Moscow.  The note also warned against the economic costs to Russia as \nregards the Ukrainian energy market and control over Ukraine's gas pipelines, which would ultimately  redound \nnegatively on Russia.\n\nKey excerpts form the document included the following quote: \"The V. Yanukovych regime finally went bankrupt. \nFor the Russian Federation to continue to support it politically, diplomatically, financially and informationally no \nlonger makes any sense\" and  suggestions that Russia risked \"losing not just the Ukrainian energy market, but what \nis much more dangerous, even indirect control over Ukraine's gas transport system.\"\n\nBut the document went further, as it mused over the benefts of integrating eastern Ukraine into the Russian fold \neither in a de facto economic alliance or in a more explicit geopolitical manner.  A key quote was as follows: \n\"Russia\u2026 should attempt to enter into cross-border cooperation agreements and then establish direct inter-\ngovernment relations with those Ukrainian territories, where there is stable pro-Russian electoral support.\" The \ndocument continues by noting that although the integration of eastern Ukrainian territories into Russia would be \ncostly,  the benefits  would be \"invaluable\" from \"a geopolitical point of view,\" since Russia would \"gain access to \nnew demographic resources\" and \"highly qualified personnel in industry and transport.\"\n\nThere was no official response from Western powers, although a NATO military official acknowledged that the \ncontents of the document were consistent with the perception that Russia was \"directly involved\" in  the \ndestabilization of eastern Ukraine. In a report published by Voice of America, that NATO official was quoted as \nsaying, \"NATO does not have any comment on the forthcoming publication of an alleged Kremlin strategy \ndocument.  But it comes to no surprise to NATO that Russia has been directly involved in destabilizing military \nactivities in Ukraine and Crimea from the outset.\"\n\nWhile the veracity of the contents of the \"analytical note\" was yet to be established, it certainly presented a \ncalculating rationale as to why Russia would back pro-Russian separatists in a bid to control eastern Ukraine.\n\nFor its part, the Kremlin dismissed the document as nonsense; however, in March 2015, a new dimension of \nRussia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine emerged when Russian President Putin said in an interview on the Rossiya-\n1 state television channel that he  ordered officials in his government to look at ways to take control over Crimea as \nearly as February 2014.  Putin said that he convened  an emergency with the commanders of his special forces to \ndiscuss the overthrow of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich, and to secure the ousted Ukrainian leader's \nsafe passage to Russia.  At the end of that meeting, according to Putin, he signaled his ambitions in Crimea.  To \n\n\n\nthis end, Putin said, \"This was on the night of Feb. 22 through to Feb. 23. We finished around 7 in the morning. \nAnd, while saying goodbye, I told all the colleagues: We have to start the work on Crimea's return into Russia.\"\n\nOf note was the fact that until this interview with Putin, Russian authorities had insisted that the decision to annex \nCrimea only occurred after the referendum  in the Black Sea peninsula, which ensued on March 16, 2014 and \nresulted in ratification of the initiative to join Russia. Now, however, Putin was advancing quite a different account.  \nRegardless of the rationale, the fact of the matter was that  Crimea was now  under Russian control.\n\nMoreover,  by the third week of March 2015, Russia made clear that it had no intention of returning Crimea to \nUkraine.  A spokesperson for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, refused to even acknowledge that Ukraine had any right \nto the territory, emphasizing that Crimea was now a Russian region.  He said, \"There is no occupation of Crimea. \nCrimea is a region of the Russian Federation and of course the subject of our regions is not up for discussion.\"  In \ntruth, however, the vast majority of the countries of the world did not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea as \nlegitimate, given the flagrant and illegal violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nUndeterred by world opinion, and interested only in advancing his national popularity, Russian President Putin \nintensified his hawkish and aggressive rhetoric, saying in an interview that he had been ready to put nuclear \nweapons on standby during the Crimea crisis.  The Russian president's willingness to play the nuclear threat card \nwas being regarded as a dangerous development, especially since Russia was soon carrying out major military \nexercises across northern Russia involving more than 45,000 troops, in what was a clear show of military strength \nintended to intimidate its neighbors. As well, Russian President Putin was flexing his aggressive and hawkish \nmuscles in the region as he ordered the Russian Northern Fleet  to be on a state of full combat readiness in the \nArctic.\n\nFor its part, Ukraine has reminded the world that the annexation of Crimea was illegal and that there would be no \nnormalization of ties with Russia in the future without the return of Crimea to its fold and respect for its sovereignty \nand territorial integrity. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin was on the record saying, \"There could be no \nslightest way of normalizing or getting back to business in the relations between Ukraine and Russia without \nreturning to status quo and establishing full Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea.\"  He continued, \"The ultimate \nprecondition for any effective, final settlement is to fully close down the Ukrainian-Russian border... Because \neverything that has been destabilizing the situation in (the Ukrainian cities of) Donetsk and Lugansk - mercenaries, \nmoney, weapons, heavy weaponry, and of course Russian rebel troops - came through the Russian-Ukrainian \nborder.\"\n\nLatest Developments\n\nAt the start of June 2015, irrespective of the prevailing Minsk ceasefire agreement, the pro-Russian stronghold of \nDonetsk in eastern Ukraine was mired by fierce fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. \nBattles were also said to be taking place in the nearby areas of  Maryinka and Krasnohorivka. Journalists on the \nground reported that it was the worst flare of violence in the region since the signing of the new ceasefire in the \nBelarusian capital of Minsk months prior, with a significant death toll likely to be calculated.\n\nAs before, the government of Ukraine, several Western powers, and NATO repeated their accusation that Russia \nwas playing an active role in the conflict, even supplying both weaponry and troops to the separatists. For its part, \nRussia dismissed these claims and even registered discontent over the term \"annexation\" as regards its seizure of \nthe Ukrainian region of Crimea, insisting that Crimea was simply \"reunited\" with Russia.  These stances by Russia \nmade clear that there was no consensus between  the various parties about the basic events that transpired in \neastern Ukraine over the course of the last year.\n\nAs regards the latest flare of violence in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Kremlin placed the blame on the Ukrainian \nmiitary, claiming that those forces had acted provcatively.  But the Ukrainian government had a different view and \nsaid that Russian-supported separatists were responsible for launching a fresh offensive to the west of Donetsk.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the veracity of the respective claims being made by either side, the fact of the matter was that  this \neruption of violence could not be simply be regarded as simple skirmishes that might blight any peace accord.  \nInstead, the use of heavy weapons  made clear that these fresh battles augured a shift in the landscape.\n\nIndeed, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko went so far as to call on his military to prepare for a possible \"full-\nscale invasion\" by Russia.  He said,  \"There is a colossal threat of a renewal of large-scale military operations from \nthe side of the Russian-terrorist groups.  \"The military must be ready as much for a renewal of an offensive by the \nenemy in the Donbass as they are for a full-scale invasion along the whole length of the border with Russia. We \nmust be truly ready for this.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president also noted that rather than reducing its military footprint in the border zone, instead there \nwere more Russian troops in the region than a year before.  He said,  \"The concentration of Russian troops near \nthe state border is one and a half times greater than a year ago.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Russian authorities dismissed this claim with a Russian defense ministry spokesperson, Igor \nKonashenkov, insisting, \"There are no regular Russian troops, let alone tactical combat groups in Ukraine.\"  \nHowever, journalists in the field have made note of the buildup of Russian troops and heavy weaponry along the \nborder with Ukraine in the late spring of 2015.\n\nNevertheless, the West was warning of fresh sanctions against Russia, if needed.  United States  Treasury \nSecretary Jack Lew offered support to Ukraine by saying that the United States and its allies from other G7 \ncountries would be prepared to  impose more sanctions, should Russia act in an aggressive manner in eastern \nUkraine. \n\nBut financial repercussions were not the only possible consequences on the table. By mid-June 2015, the United \nStates  Pentagon indicated it would move heavy weaponry, such as battle tanks and other infantry fighting vehicles, \nand even United States troops,  to Eastern European and Baltic countries.  The move, should it come to pass, \nwould be the first time the United States has placed heavy military equipment on the territories of young NATO \nstates in the region since the end of the Cold War.  As such, it was sure to anger Russia, which has been trying to \nincrease its hegemonic presence in the region while driving the countries in the region from the NATO orbit.  \nInstead, Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine was having the opposite effect.\n\nFor its part, Russia warned that it would react by ramping up its own forces in the region.  In an interview with the \nInterfax news agency,  Russian General Yuri Yakubov said,  \"If heavy U.S. military equipment, including tanks, \nartillery batteries and other equipment really does turn up in countries in eastern Europe and the Baltics, that will be \nthe most aggressive step by the Pentagon and NATO since the Cold War. Russia will have no option but to build up \nits forces and resources on the Western strategic front.\"\n\nKey Developments in the second part of 2015 --\n\nIn mid-2015, Ukraine's parliament was moving forward with constitutional reforms aimed at establishing temporary \nself-rule in the eastern part of the country under pro-Russian rebel rule.  The changes to the constitution were \naimed at meeting Ukraine's obligations under the prevailing Minsk peace accord.  The main provisions contained in \nthe constitutional changes centered on plans for decentralization of power, granting the pro-Russian rebels \nautonomy in key areas, such as financial and local administration.  Ukraine would retain control in areas of  \ndefense, foreign policy, national security,  rule of law, and civil liberties.\n\nWhile the legislative progress in Ukraine signaled to some that the government in Kiev was adhering to its Minsk \npeace accord commitments,  Russia objected to the changes, arguing that they did not go far enough to fulfill the \nobligations of the Minsk.  Russian President\n\n\n\nVladimir Putin also argued that the constitutional changes were conceived without consulting the Russian-backed \nrebels in eastern Ukraine.  But there were objections at home in Ukraine where nationalists railed against the move \nto grant autonomy to pro-Russian rebels,  arguing angrily that it constituted political surrender to Russia.\n\nIn late August 2015, as legislation on the constitutional reforms granting eastern Ukraine greater self-rule  were \nbeing debated,  violent clashes erupted outside the parliamentary building in Kiev.  Nationalist protesters hurled \ngrenades, firecrackers, and smoke bombs  at the parliament as the so-called \"decentralization\" legislation was \nbeing advanced for a first reading in the legislative chamber.  The ensuing melee resulted in the deaths of at least \ntwo Ukrainian national guardsmen charged with protecting the building, as well as injuries to another 100 people -- \nmost of whom were security personnel.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk as well as Interior Minister Arsen Avakov placed the  blame for the \nviolence on the hardline nationalist party,  Svoboda (Freedom), which they said was fomenting unrest.\n\nFor his part, Ukrainian President Poroshenko concentrated on the political aspect,  warning that if the \ndecentralization legislation was not passed by parliament, in keeping with the commitments required by the Minsk \nAgreement, Ukraine would be at risk of losing its Western support.  To this end, President Poroshenko said, \"There \nwould have been a real possibility of us being left alone with the aggressor.\"  Heeding this warning, the Ukrainian \nparliament passed the bill although some hardline nationalist member of parliament railed against the move, \nscreaming \"Shame\" as the vote was going forward.  But this was just a first reading vote with further parliamentary \nmeasures to go before the bill actually became the law of the land.  It was to be seen if it would survive the heated \npolitical environs in Ukraine.\n\nIn September 2015, the schedule for local elections in the pro-Russian eastern part of Ukraine was the cause of \nconsternation.  Under the terms of the prevailing Minsk peace agreement, local elections in the pro-Russian \nseparatist regions of eastern Ukraine were to be held at the same time as elections across Ukraine.  But due to \ncontinuing unrest in eastern Ukraine, the government in Kiev said that the vote would have to be postponed.  \nAngered by the prospect of delayed elections, the pro-Russian separatists decided to schedule local polls for \nOctober and November 2015 anyway.\n\nThe government of Ukraine responded to this act of defiance by the separatists by declaring that it would not view \nthose polls as legitimate and thus not recognize the results.  As noted by Ukrainian President Poroshenko:  \"These \naren't elections, they're not free, they will not meet the standards of the OSCE. This directly and severely \ncontradicts the Minsk agreements.\"  The imbroglio was thus threatening to erode and even upend the Minsk peace \nagreement.\n\nGiven  these deteriorating conditions, Russia entered to fray in October 2015 and urged the pro-Russian separatists \nto postpone the local elections.  With the polls now set for February 2016 instead, both sides were given some \nbreathing  room and necessary time to craft a scheduling solution that would be mutually acceptable.  The West \napplauded Moscow for playing a constructive role and effectively saving the Minsk peace agreement from collapse.  \nMore skeptical observers  suggested that Moscow's shift to being a more cooperative player in the Ukrainian crisis \nwas likely driven by its impending financial woes that might require external assistance as well as its new pre-\noccupation with the Syrian quagmire.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions between Ukraine and the pro-Russian elements continued to be an issue in the region, with \nUkraine clearly alarmed about the potential collapse of the peace deal.  Of note was Ukraine's request that NATO \nprovide military weaponry to help that country defend itself from Russian-backed rebels.  As noted by Ukrainian \nPrime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, \"Defense capabilities are essential to us in the face of a nuclear country, which \nhas spent tens of billions of dollars on modernizing its army.\"\n\n\n\nNot keen to be drawn into the conflict and threatening the already-fragile Minsk peace accord,  NATO Secretary-\nGeneral Jens Stoltenberg signed an agreement to  help modernize the Ukrainian armed forces, but stopped short of \nagreeing to directly provide Ukraine with military weapons.  In an interview with Reuters News,  Stoltenberg said, \n\"NATO does not provide or supply weapons.\"  He added, \"The main focus now is the implementation of the Minsk \nagreement.\"\n\nIn another sign that the Minsk ceasefire -- fragile as it was -- remained in tact was the fact that both pro-Russian \nrebels and Ukrainian forces withdrew their light weapons.\n\nGiven this development, it was perhaps not entirely surprising that NATO was not interested in sparking a fire that \nwas now simmering instead of blazing.  Overall, the developments in eastern Ukraine in October 2015 were being \ncautiously regarded as hopeful signs for a more enduring peace.\n\nUpdate on  Malaysian Air shoot-down disaster:\n\nIn mid-2015, a year after Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over an eastern Ukrainian war zone, killing \nclose to 300 people, there was a call for justice as evidence began to mount against Russian-backed rebels.  Of \nparticular note was a proposal for a United Nations tribunal to prosecute suspects of Malaysian Air shoot-down \ndisaster over eastern Ukraine, as well as a legal case seeking compensation for the families of victims.  As July \n2015 came to a close, Russia vetoed that proposal when it came before the United Nations Security Council, \nraising questions that its action was politically motivated.  Those suspicions were raised more acutely when, in \nAugust 2015, Dutch investigators said fragments of a Russian missile system were found at the crash site, \nessentially implicating  Russia more directly in the shoot-down disaster, which had been generally attributed to pro-\nRussian separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Now,  with physical evidence of a Russian missile system being found at \nthe scene of the crash, the Russian veto of the proposal for a United Nations tribunal to prosecute suspects stood \nout as an example of Russia acting in its own self-interest.\n\nGoing back to mid-2014, the landscape in eastern Ukraine was beset by crisis as Russian-backed separatists were \nat war with the Ukrainian forces in what was becoming a bloody and volent conflict.  The already-dire geopolitical \nlandscape took a disturbing turn on July 17, 2014, when a civilian passenger aircraft traveling from  Amsterdam in \nthe Netherlands to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia went down in eastern Ukraine.  All 298 people aboard the on board \nthe Boeing 777 airliner -- 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members -- perished when Malaysian \nAirlines flight 17 crashed in the rebel-held territory of Donesk close to the Russian border.\n\nThat event augured a geopolitical landmine when it was revealed that the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down \nand  blame was soon placed on pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces.  Of particular significance was \nthe mounting evidence pointing to the fact that the aircraft was struck  by a Russian-supplied missile, which was \nlikely fired by pro-Russian rebels operating in the area.\n\nIndeed, a preliminary report released in September 2014 made  note of the fact that the damage to the Flight 17's  \nfuselage and cockpit indicated that it had been impacted by  high-energy objects from outside the aircraft.  This \nfinding was consistent with the theory that Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was hit  by a missile of some kind.  This \ntheory was further bolstered when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the United States reported \nthat there was a \"solid case\" that a SA-11 missile -- also known as the Buk surface-to-surface missile  -- was fired \nfrom eastern Ukraine and likely struck the airliner, causing it to crash and killing all those on board.  Other evidence \ninvolved voice recordings of pro-Russian rebel commanders admitting they had shot down the airliner. \n\nThe tragedy soon transposed into something of a scandal when the Russian-backed rebels  prevented emergency \nresponders from gathering the remains  of passengers, and in fact treated both the human remains and the \nbelongings of victims with grave disrespect.  As such, in the aftermath of the tragic downing of the Malaysian \n\n\n\nAirlines flight, and because the majority of the victims with Dutch nationals, Europe's stance against Russia \nhardened.  Accordingly,  the West -- including the United States and the European Union --  intensified its sanctions \nregime against Russia.  For its part, Russia has throughout denied any responsible for the tragedy.\n\nA year later in mid-July 2015,  the Dutch Safety Board, which was leading a multinational investigation into the \ntragedy,  was in the process of compiling a report on the shoot-down disaster.  While the final report was not due to \nbe released until October 2015, preliminary findings indicated the following:  1. There was \"no evidence of technical \nor human error\" ;  2. The flight data recorder showed that \"all engine parameters were normal for cruise flight\" until \nthe recording \"stopped abruptly\" at the time of the crash;  3. Evidence pointed to the fact that the Russian Buk \nsurface-to-surface missile  was fired from a village in  eastern Ukraine under pro-Russian control and struck \nMalaysian Air Flight 17, precipitating the crash.\n\nThe report also chided Malaysian Airlines for continuing to fly over a dangerous war zone despite other countries' \ndispatches and warnings, known as \"notices to airmen\" or NOTAMs.\n\nAs these preliminary findings began to circulate in the public sphere, Malaysia -- one of the countries involved in the \nmultinational inquest  -- demanded that the United Nations authorize a tribunal to further probe the crash.  This call \nwas echoed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands -- the country that bore the brunt of the tragic death \ntoll in the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 -- as he argued that  an international tribunal would be needed to \nensure justice was served.  For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed this call for the establishment \nof such a prosecutorial United Nations tribunal, casting the move as \"premature.\"  But his stance was not finding \nresonance across the world. \n\nMeanwhile, relatives  of the Flight 17  victims were wasting no time seeking legal recourse and financial reparations \nas they filed a  $900 million  lawsuit against a Russian-supported rebel leader believed to be responsible for the \nshoot-down disaster over the eastern Ukrainian warzone.  The legal writ filed in the United States alleged that a \nRussian national,  Igor Strelkov ( also known as Igor Girkin) was functioning as a rebel leader in eastern Ukraine, \nand was acting with the \"actual or apparent\" authority of Russian government when  Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was \nshot down over eastern Ukraine.  Court documents made available to Agence France Presse included the following \nassertion: \"Flight 17 flew over the airspace of the area in which the aforesaid rebel army was waging its war \nactivities and the rebel army under the command responsibility of defendant Girkin shot down the subject Boeing \n777-200 aircraft.\"\n\nFloyd Wisner, the attorney who advanced the lawsuit on behalf of the victims' families said the legal action had  \n\"nothing to do with the money.\"  Instead, he made clear that it was intended to pressure both the United Nations \nand Russia to bring those responsible to justice.  Wisner said, \"The relatives want answers, and we believe Girkin \nhas answers. This lawsuit could shed light on the families' concerns, particularly over slow-moving diplomatic \nmeasures.\"\n\nNote that as July 2015 came to a close, Russia -- a permanent and thus veto-wielding member of the United \nNations Security Council -- vetoed a draft resolution calling for a United Nations tribunal to be established  to \nprosecute suspects of Malaysian Air shoot-down disaster over eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe proposal was rewarded with 11 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council voting in its favor, \nand with Angola, Venezuela, and China abstaining from the vote.  But even that overwhelming tally was not enough \nto save the draft from surviving Russia's veto.\n\nGiven Russia's apparent complicity in the disaster, the general consensus was that the veto was a measure of self-\ninterest by Moscow.\n\n\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin made this point himself as he said, \"There can be no reason to oppose \nthis [ unless you are a perpetrator yourself.\"  For his part,  Russia's  Amabassador to the United Nations, Vitaly \nChurkin, dismissed the claim that  his country's was attempting to stymie the process of accountability.  He noted \nthat  criminal prosecutions would have been carried out in a \"closed fashion\" and blamed  the media for \"aggressive \npropaganda.\"\n\nDespite this defense, Russia's veto was decried internationally and  vociferously.  United States Amabassador to \nthe United Nations, Samantha Power, condemned Russia's veto of the draft proposal seeking, as she declared, \n\"Russia has callously disregarded the public outcry in the grieving nations.\"  Australian Foreign Minister Julie \nBishop cast the Russian veto as  \"an affront to the memory of the 298 victims of MH17 and their families and \nfriends.\"  Foreign Minister Bishop also intimated that the Russian veto was not the end of the matter. Instead, she \nsaid that her country would be joined by Malaysia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Ukraine in seeking an alternative \npathway to prosecution mechanism.\n\nBy August 2015, suspicions about the Russian veto at the United Nations Security Council and Russia's eagerness \nto evade accountability were heightened more acutely when Dutch investigators said fragments of the Russian Buk \nsurface-to-air missile system were found at the crash site.\n\nFred Westerbeke, a spokesperson for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, made clear that the fragments  were very \nclearly  not parts of the downed aircraft, and that examinations had shown that they were likely from a missile \nsystem.  He said, \"We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a \npossible system that took down MH17. If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) -- led by the Netherlands, but also including representatives of \nUkraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia -- announced that  seven missile fragments had been \"secured during a \nprevious recovery mission in eastern Ukraine.\"  The JIT added that further investigation was thus in the offing, \nnoting, \"The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more \ninformation about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of \nthese parts.\"\n\nIt was expected that the JIT would prevail upon the expertise of weapons experts and forensic specialists to refine \nits examination.\n\nThe  investigators stopped short of outright accusing Russia of being behind the shoot-down disaster, noting in \ncareful terms that they had not yet proved a \"causal connection\" between Russia and the crash of Malaysian \nAirlines Flight 17 that killed close to  298 people on board.\n\nThe discovery of  physical evidence of the  Russian missile system  essentially implicated  Russia more closely  in \nthe shoot-down disaster, which had been generally attributed to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.  But in  \ntruth, the main question going forward would be whether or not the fatal missile was fired by Russian-backed \nseparatists, or, if the Russian military had played a more direct role in the disaster.\n\nA concluding note --\n\nUkraine's \"Maidan\" uprising of 2013 and 2014, resulting in the removal of the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych  from \noffice  and the dismantling of his authority in 2014, were signs that Ukraine was actively resisting influence from \nMoscow.  They were also clear signals that Ukraine was determined to set its own course --  and quite likely in the \ndirection of Europe.  The people of Ukraine were delivering Russia a clear message that they would be the agents \nof their own self-determination.  However, Russian President Vladimir Putin was not in a mood to receive that \nmessage.\n\n\n\nThe invasion and de facto annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea by Russia, under the guise of \"protecting\" \nthe Russian ethno-linguistic population, showed that Russia felt entitled to stake a claim on Ukraine.\n\nFor the wider world, this action recalled alarming memories of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, under \nthe aegis of the Brezhnev Policy,  to subdue the independence-minded Prague Spring .  It also  evoked suggestions \nthat Putin was attempting to recraft a Cold War Russian quasi-empire in the mold of the former Soviet Union.\n\nWhile the \"Maidan\" or Independence Square in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev would be stamped in the history books \nas \"Ground Zero\" of Ukraine's 2014 unrest, the battleground had clearly move eastward with Crimea as a new \nflashpoint.  But with fighting going on elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, and with \"new Russia\" enclaves been declared \nin Donetsk and Luhansk later in 2014, it was evident that Russia would not end its Ukrainian adventure at the \nborders of Crimea.\n\nIn much the same way as the Turks annexed northern Cyprus from that country in 1976, claiming it was protecting \nthe rights of the Turkish ethnic population in Cyprus, which was home to an ethnically Greek population, Russia has \ndone the same in eastern Ukraine.  To date, Cyprus has remained divided  by the so-called \"Green Line,\" with an \ninternationally recognized Cyprus encompassing most of the island, and a Turkish enclave to the north, which does \nnot enjoy international recognition. A similar Ukraine/Crimea division could materialize as the likely outcome of this \nunfolding crisis.\n\nBut with an alternative scenario unfolding that  takes Russian ambitons beyond Crimea, possibly in pursuit of the  \ngas pipelines that traverse wider Ukrainian territory, a tidy solution was unlikely.\n\nAt stake were Russian ambitions to regain territory lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The reality was \nthat Russia was attempting to destabilize Ukraine by supporting pro-Russian cabals in eastern Ukraine, and with an \neye on  establishing southern and eastern Ukraine as part of Vladimir Putin's \"new Russia.\"\n\nIt was to be seen if the landscape in eastern Europe represented the foundation for a renewed Cold War between \nthe East and West.  Given the geopolitical and geostrategic stakes, the outcome was clearly being textured by \nbloodshed and tears. Russian President Putin was banking on the West's rationality and its reluctance to be drawn \ninto another conflict -- especially one on European soil.\n\nFrom the point of view of United States President Barack Obama, the very notion of a  Cold War being in the offing  \nwas to be dismissed. According to President Obama, Russia was no longer a superpower and was now operating \nfrom a position of weakness as it intimidated neighbors such as Ukraine.  But the tragic downing of a commercial \nairliner in eastern Ukraine in July 2014 raised the geopolitical stakes, and has since spurred the West to apply \neconomic sanctions to Russia.\n\nEconomic pressures may have played a hand in forcing Russia to the negotiating table and the forging of two \nseparate ceasefire agreements in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.  But, to date, neither Minsk ceasefire agreement \nhas managed to stem the flow of blood, and the encroachment of pro-Russian forces into eastern Ukrainian \nterritory.\n\nIn the long run, the outcome to this story was yet to be written.\n\nSpecial Entry:  Russia launches military exercises in disputed territories of Georgia\n\nIn the backdrop of Russia's encroachment into eastern Ukraine, and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, surrounding \ncountries have watched warily, wondering if its territories would be similarly affected.  In March 2015, Russia's \nDefense  Ministry confirmed that large-scale military exercises involving 2,000 Russian troops had commenced in \nthe southern part of the country, along contested borders and even in disputed regions.\n\n\n\nThe areas affected included  the federal districts of Southern and North Caucasus, as well as the recently annexed \nUkrainian region of Crimea. Military drills were also taking place on Russian military bases  Armenia,  and in the \nGeorgian separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nThe moves were being regarded as a symbolic illustration of Russian hegemony and influence in the region, \nirrespective of global outrage over Russia's backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine and the ensuing war that has \nrocked the region since 2014.\n\nIn fact, while global attention has focused on Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea, Russia has \nbeen quitely working towards subsuming the semi-autonomous Georgian territory of South Ossetia into its fold.  In \nfact, a treaty, known as the \"Treaty of Alliance and Integration\"  was drafted in December 2014 with the intent of \nintegrating the Russian speaking enclave, irrespective of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity or its legal \nclaim on South Ossetia.  At the  end of January  2015, the leader of South Ossetia, Leonid Tibilov, dispatched \nfinalized documents to Moscow. In February 2015, Russia and South Ossetia signed the \"Treaty on the State \nBorder,\" which was being viewed as a first step towards the signing of the broader \"Treaty of Alliance and \nIntegration.\"  Once that integration accord was signed, South Ossetia would be absorbed by Russia over a period \nof months.\n\nA similar process has been underway as regards the other Georgian semi-autonomous breakaway region, \nAbkhazia, which was also home to a Russian-speaking population.  The alliance and integration measures related \nto Abkhazia, however, were not regarded as comprehensive as the integration accord at stake for South Ossetia.\n\nNote that on March 18, 2015, Russian President Putin signed the aforementioned Treaty of Alliance and \nIntegration,\"  which (illegally) integrated the breakaway territory with Russia.  The government of Georgia in Tbilisi \ncast the development as a provocation with the aim of stealing Georgian territory. As noted by Georgian Foreign \nMinister Tamar Beruchashvili, \"It's a cynical and provocative step by Russia ... We consider it a move aimed at \nannexation.\" Meanwhile, leading Western countries said it was a dangerous threat to tegional stability.\n\nAs with the annexation of Crimea, the integration of Georgian territories had no chance of gaining international \nrecognition, and instead, Russia's territorial encroachment has been widely condemned. Indeed, the United States \nand the European Union condemned the new treaty with South Ossetia.  Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the \nUnited States Department of State said, \"The United States' position on South Ossetia and Abkhazia remains clear: \nthese regions are integral parts of Georgia, and we continue to support Georgia's independence, its sovereignty, \nand its territorial integrity.\" Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy head, said the treaty was  \"yet \nanother step\" intended to undermine \"ongoing efforts to strengthen security and stability in the region.\"\n\nOf course,  as noted  above, the loudest outrage as regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia has come from Georgia, \nwhich already fought a war with Russia in 2008 over these very issues of control.  Nevertheless, Russian President \nVladimir Putin was not expected to curtail his expansionist ambitions.  In fact, the Russian leader was flexing his \naggressive and hawkish muscles in the region as he ordered the Russian Northern Fleet  to be on a state of full \ncombat readiness in the Arctic.  As well, Russia commenced major military exercises across northern Russia \ninvolving more than 45,000 troops, in what was a clear show of military strength intended to intimidate its neighbors.\n\nSpecial Entry: Death of opposition leader and Putin critic Nemtsov\n\nOn Feb. 27, 2015, Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader and well-known critic of President Vladimir Putin, \nwas shot to death in central Moscow in close proximity to the highly-fortified Russian Kremlin.  Nemtsov served as \nthe  governor of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and as a vice premier in the  waning years of the presidency of Boris \nYeltsin in the late 1990s.  As Putin gained prominence in the post-Yeltsin period, Nemtsov evolved into a sharp anti-\ngovernment critic.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the killing of his political nemesis, and in a telegram to \nNemtsov's mother, promised that the killer(s) would be brought to justice.  However, Western powers were not \nabout to easily accept Putin's gestures and instead called for an open investigation into the killing of Nemtsov.\n\nAdding an ominous dimension to the mystery surrounding his death was Nemtsov's own anxieties about being the \nsubject of a political assassination.  In a recent interview, Nemtsov mused about his fears that Russian President \nPutin might have him eliminated over his objections to the Russian military's activies in eastern Ukraine.  In fact, \nNemtsov was murdered just hours after he gave an  interview in which he urged Russians in Moscow to participate \nin an opposition rally to protest Putin's \"mad, aggressive, and deadly policy of war against Ukraine.\"\n\nOf note has been the fact that Russian authorities have suggested that Nemtsov's murder was aimed at \ndestabilizing the  country, with some pro-Putin Russian politicians saying that the killing of Nemtsov  was a \n\"provocation\" against the state.  Left outside the \"official\" discussion in Russia, however, has been the glaring \nreality that Nemtsov himself speculated about being killed for his views in opposition to the Russian government.\n\nOn March 1, 2015, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets in Moscow to rally in protest of Nemtsov's \ndeath.\n\nOn March 8, 2015, two individuals were charged in connection with the murder of Nemtsov.  Russian authorities \nsaid that  Zaur Dadayev admitted  his involvement in the shooting death of Nemtsov close to the Kremlin in Moscow \na week earlier.  Dadayev and the other alleged assailant,  Anzor Gubashev, -- both of whom were of Chechen \norigin -- were said to have been the organizers of a plot to kill Nemtsov. Three other suspects were in police \ncustody while a sixth individual reportedly committed suicide during an altercation with authorities in the Chechen \ncapital Grozny.\n\nRussian authorities were advancing the theory that the suspects were opposed to Nemtsov's defense of satirical \ncartoons, of the type published by the French entity Charlie Hebdo, which portrayed the Islamic prophet \nMohammed in an unflattering light.  Stated differently, Russian authorities were suggesting that the assailants were \nmotivated by their adherence to political Islam.\n\nSome of Nemtsov's supporters, including the well-known opposition leader, Alexei Navalny,  have rejected this \nnarrative.  They have suggested that the men in custody were actually hired to assassinate the opposition leader, \nwith the Islamist extremist explanation refocusing attention away from Putin and the Kremlin.\n\nSpecial Note on Russian Economy\n\nIn  April 2015, it was apparent that Western sanctions against Russia were having an effect as the Russian \neconomy contracted by two percent in the first three months of the year. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev  \nmade it clear that Western sanctions, along with the low price of oil, were the causes of the first contraction in the \nRussian economy since 2009.  He also intimated that more economic pain might be in the future, but insisted that \nRussians could cope with the hardship. He also  reminded Russians that the sacrifice was necessary, given the \nimperative of regaining control over Crimea.  Indeed, the Ukrainian territory of Crimea resided at the heart of the \nmatter with the Russian support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and the illegal annexation of the \nUkrainian territory of Crimea being thevery reason the West imposed sanctions on Russia in the first place.\n\nEconomic pressure on Russia had been building for several months.  Indeed, in December 2014, Russia was faced \nwith economic calamity due to the decreasing price of oil.  As a result, the  Bank of Russia raised its key interest \nrate to 17 percent from 10.5 percent.  The interest rate hike was being interpreted as a desperate move by Russia \nto bolster its currency, the Ruble,  and to ultimately help revitalize its ailing economy.\n\nWestern sanctions, led by the United States and the European Union, against Russia for its aggression in eastern \nUkraine and  its seizure of Crimea, have taken a destructive toll on the Russian economy.  Of note was  a new  \n\n\n\nround of Western sanctions in September 2014, which included restrictions on key Russian companies from \nfinancial markets, as well as limits on the imports of some technologies.\n\nOne tangible consequence was the  collapsing Russian currency. Indeed, the the value of the Ruble sank about 50 \npercent since the start of the year.  That falling currency value promised to escalate inflation in Russia, trigger \nconsumer panic and a possible run on the banks, thus causing further damage to the economy.\n\nThe assertive move by the Bank of Russia was intended to guard against these deleterious consequences. Most \nspecifically, there were hopes that a rise in interest rates would coax investors to keep their funds in Russian \nbanks.  But even with these moves, it was difficult to tell if they would be enough to rescue Russia. A higher interest \nrate would stymie growth, and almost guarantee that Russia would be heading into a recession -- as reflected in the \nRussian government's own decision to downgrade it forecast for the next year.\n\nMeanwhile, the fact of the matter was that the Russian energy economy was reliant on the average price of a barrel \nof oil, which  has dropped below $56 from a  high mid-year  of $107.  With oil and gas occupying as much as  two \nthirds of Russian exports,  and with  Russian  public expenditure being largely supported by energy-related \nrevenues, Moscow could expect a significant -- and unsustainable -- deficit on its trade and financial engagement \nwith the global market place.  With this path ahead for Russia, it was not surprising that investors were not \nenthused about keeping their funds in Russian banks, and the result was a precipitous slide in the value of the \nRuble.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin's rivals took the opportunity to place blame on the Russian president for the economic \nwoes facing the country.  Former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov -- a one-time Putin stalwart who was now an \nopposition chief -- made the following charge in an interview with Reuters News: \"Russia is going into decline. 2015 \nis a year in which Putin must make a principle decision.\"  That decision, according to Kasyanov, would be in the \npolitical realm as he called for Putin to either resign or hold early elections.  He said that Putin he should have \"just \na quiet departure through presidential elections.\"  He continued, \"I don't believe he will win presidential elections if \nthey are free and fair.\"\n\nIn truth, however, Putin's popularity was actually bolstered by his decision to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and \nannex Crimea.  Thus, despite Kasyanov's claims, early elections might serve simply to ratify Putin's mandate. Of \ncourse, the next scheduled elections were not due until 2018, and continued external pressure in the form of \nsanctions and low oil prices could significantly change the political climate in the future.\n\nFor his part, Russian President Putin has sidestepped any serious discussion of the economic ills  facing Russia, \ninstead blaming the West during an annual address at the end of 2014.  He said, \"Sometimes I think, maybe they'll \n(the West) let the bear eat berries and honey in the forest, maybe they will leave it in peace. They will not. Because \nthey will always try to put him on a chain, and as soon as they succeed in doing so they tear out his fangs and his \nclaws.\" Putin's rhetoric -- bereft of an actual economic plan of action -- indicated that he intended to rely in \nnationalist sentiment to ride out the negative economic climate.  It was to be seen if this approach would actually be \neffective.\n\nMeanwhile, United States President Barack Obama entered the equation, saying in an interview with National \nPublic Radio in December 2014  that Putin made a \"strategic mistake\" when he annexed Crimea.  Pushing back at \nhis conservative critics in the United States who have intimated that the Russian president had outplayed the West \nby  flexing his military muscle in eastern Ukraine, Obama said that the burgeoning economic calamity in Russia had \nproved those critics wrong. The United States leader said, \"You'll recall that three or four months ago, everybody in \nWashington was convinced that President Putin was a genius and he had outmaneuvered all of us and he had \nbullied and strategized his way into expanding Russian power.\" Obama  continued, \"Today, I'd sense that at least \noutside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did wasn't so smart.\"  President Obama noted that \n\n\n\nsanctions had left the  Russian economy vulnerable to the volatility of the energy market.  Comparing the Russian \nscenario to the relative stability of the United States economy, Obama said, \"The big advantage we have with \nRussia is we've got a dynamic, vital economy, and they don't. They rely on oil. We rely on oil and iPads and movies \nand you name it.\"\n\nBy April 2015, it was reported that Western sanctions against Russia were having an effect as the Russian \neconomy contracted by two percent in the first three months of the year. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev \nmade the announcement during an address to members of the Russian parliament, and made clear that Western \nsanctions, along with the lower price of oil,  constituted the reasons for the  the first contraction in the Russian \neconomy since 2009.\n\nThose Western sanctions were imposed because of Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine, including the annexation \nof Crimea.  Prime Minister Medvedv addressed this reality head on, saying, the the weightiest pressure on the \nRussian economy had come from \"the main political decision last year -- the return of Crimea to Russia.\"  He \nintimated that this was a necessary process, noting that the return of Crimea to Russia was vital, and comparing it \nto the \"reunification of Germany or the return to China of Hong Kong and Macao.\"\n\nOf course, the cost of that \"vital\" reunification was likely to increased, with the Russian Central Bank warning that \nthe economy could  shrink even further through the year to four percent, if the price of oil stayed around $50 a \nbarrel. Still, the Russian head of government also insisted that Russia would weather the economic storm. Prime \nMinister Medvedev said, \"If external pressure intensifies, and oil prices remain at an extremely low level for a long \ntime, we will have to develop in a new economic reality.  I am convinced that we will be able to live even in such a \nreality. The experience of the recent period has shown that we have learnt how to do this.\"\n\nNote: The prospects of a Russian economic calamity will likely be somewhat mitigated by the reality that it still \nretains significant currency reserves that the International Monetary Fund has said would account for about one \nyear's worth of imports.\n\nSpecial Entry: Russia questions 1991 recognition of Baltic states' independence\n\nIn mid-2015,  Russia was questioning the recognition of  the independence of the Baltic nation states of Latvia, \nLithuania, and Estonia.\n\nThe office of Russia's chief prosecutor announced plans to examine the legitimacy of the former Soviet Union's \nrecognition of the three Baltic countries in 1991, and to specifically consider whether the action was legal.  The \naction was spurred by letters by two members of parliament, who alleged that the decision to recognize the \nindependence of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia has been taken  \"by an unconstitutional body.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, the governments of the Baltic countries  reacted with outrage.  Lithuanian President Dalia \nGrybauskaite reacted by declaring: \"Our independence was gained through the blood and sacrifice of the \nLithuanian people. No one has the right to threaten it.\"  Her country's  Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius \ncharacterized the  investigation  as \"a provocation to say the least\"  and also  an \"absurd provocation.\"  In an \ninterview with Reuters News, Estonian Foreign Minister Keit Pentus-Rosimannus offered a similar assessment.  \nPentus-Rosimannus said, \"The entire issue is legally absurd. It serves as yet another example of the resurgent \nimperialistic mood that unfortunately exists in Russia.\"\n\nThat sense of concern over Russia's imperial aspirations was real,  given that country's recent actions in eastern \nUkraine, and in particular, the annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Faced with international condemnation for its \nannexation of the Ukrainian territory, Russia's  chief prosecutor  justified the move by declaring that Crimea was \nillegally transferred  from Russia to Ukraine in 1954.  Now, there were fears that Russia was using the same type of \n\n\n\njustification in regard to the Baltic countries, which were underSoviet control from 1940 until the disintegration of the \nSoviet Union in 1991.  Indeed, this suggestion by Russia that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia may have been granted \nindependent recognition illegally  was raising the alarm that Russia was now looking to return the Baltic nation \nstates to its fold, as part of Russian Vladimir Putin's recent penchant to reconstitute the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile Russia has sought to quiet these concerns,  with the Kremlin casting the investigation as simply a formality \nwith no legal consequences, there remained prevailing anxieties about these moves, even if they proved to be \nperfunctory.  The fact of the matter was that if Russia did, in fact, seek to re-absorb the three Baltic countries, there \nwould be consequences in terms of global security.  With Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia being NATO member \nstates, an attack on their sovereignty would spur a defensive response by NATO.\n\nSpecial Entry: Russia encroaches  into semi-autonomous Georgian  territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia\n\n-- Some portions of this entry replicated from entry above due to relevance --\n\nIn the backdrop of Russia's encroachment into eastern Ukraine, and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, surrounding \ncountries have watched warily, wondering if its territories would be similarly affected.  In March 2015, Russia's \nDefense  Ministry confirmed that large-scale military exercises involving 2,000 Russian troops had commenced in \nthe southern part of the country, along contested borders and even in disputed regions.\n\nThe areas affected included  the federal districts of Southern and North Caucasus, as well as the recently annexed \nUkrainian region of Crimea. Military drills were also taking place on Russian military bases  Armenia,  and in the \nGeorgian separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nThe moves were being regarded as a symbolic illustration of Russian hegemony and influence in the region, \nirrespective of global outrage over Russia's backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine and the ensuing war that has \nrocked the region since 2014.\n\nIn fact, while global attention has focused on Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea, Russia has \nbeen quitely working towards subsuming the semi-autonomous Georgian territory of South Ossetia into its fold.  In \nfact, a treaty, known as the \"Treaty of Alliance and Integration\"  was drafted in December 2014 with the intent of \nintegrating the Russian speaking enclave, irrespective of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity or its legal \nclaim on South Ossetia.  At the  end of January  2015, the leader of South Ossetia, Leonid Tibilov, dispatched \nfinalized documents to Moscow. In February 2015, Russia and South Ossetia signed the \"Treaty on the State \nBorder,\" which was being viewed as a first step towards the signing of the broader \"Treaty of Alliance and \nIntegration.\"  Once that integration accord was signed, South Ossetia would be absorbed by Russia over a period \nof months.\n\nA similar process has been underway as regards the other Georgian semi-autonomous breakaway region, \nAbkhazia, which was also home to a Russian-speaking population.  The alliance and integration measures related \nto Abkhazia, however, were not regarded as comprehensive as the integration accord at stake for South Ossetia.\n\nOn March 18, 2015, Russian President Putin signed the aforementioned Treaty of Alliance and Integration,\"  which \n(illegally) integrated the breakaway territory with Russia.  The government of Georgia in Tbilisi cast the \ndevelopment as a provocation with the aim of stealing Georgian territory. As noted by Georgian Foreign Minister \nTamar Beruchashvili, \"It's a cynical and provocative step by Russia ... We consider it a move aimed at annexation.\" \nMeanwhile, leading Western countries said it was a dangerous threat to regional stability.\n\nAs with the annexation of Crimea, the integration of Georgian territories had no chance of gaining international \nrecognition, and instead, Russia's territorial encroachment has been widely condemned. Indeed, the United States \n\n\n\nand the European Union condemned the new treaty with South Ossetia.  Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the \nUnited States Department of State said, \"The United States' position on South Ossetia and Abkhazia remains clear: \nthese regions are integral parts of Georgia, and we continue to support Georgia's independence, its sovereignty, \nand its territorial integrity.\" Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy head, said the treaty was  \"yet \nanother step\" intended to undermine \"ongoing efforts to strengthen security and stability in the region.\"\n\nOf course,  as noted  above, the loudest outrage as regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia has come from Georgia, \nwhich already fought a war with Russia in 2008 over these very issues of control.  Nevertheless, Russian President \nVladimir Putin was not expected to curtail his expansionist ambitions.  In fact, the Russian leader was flexing his \naggressive and hawkish muscles in the region as he ordered the Russian Northern Fleet  to be on a state of full \ncombat readiness in the Arctic.  As well, Russia commenced major military exercises across northern Russia \ninvolving more than 45,000 troops, in what was a clear show of military strength intended to intimidate its neighbors.\n\nBy mid-July 2015, the European Union was warning that while world attention remained on Russia's land grab in \nUkraine, Russia was doing the same in the Georgian semi-autonomous regions.\n\nOf note was the fact that  Russia had installed its own border signs inside South Ossetia, as it continued its quiet \nabsorption of the Georgian territory.\n\nAs the European Union had warned, Russia was intent on redrawing the regional map, effectively expanding its \nterritory in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, to the detriment of Georgian sovereignty.  A statement by the European \nUnion foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, aimed to remind Russia that it was acting in violation of international \nlaw and read as follows:  \"The EU reaffirms its full support for Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally \nrecognized borders.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the political landscape is Georgia was tense due to Russia's moves in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nOn July 18, 2015, thousands of demonstrators were on the streets of the Georgian capital of Tblisi to register their \noutrage over what Russia's so-called \"occupation\" of the two semi-autonomous regions.  In an interview with \nAgence France Presse, Tamara Chergoleishvili, a leading protest organizer, explained the mass action as follows: \n\"The Kremlin continues to use both hard and soft power in its efforts to subjugate Georgia.  We gathered here to \nshow that Russia's aggressive policy doesn't belong to the 21st century.\"\n\nSpecial Note on Russian engagement in Syrian Crisis\n\nSince early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an \naddition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in March 2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding \nthe resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end \ncorruption. For his part, President Assad announced he would advance a reform agenda, which would include lifting \nthe emergency laws that had been in place for decades, and increased rights to the country's disenfranchised \nKurdish population. These moves were aimed at quelling the rising climate of unrest gripping the country. But over \ntime, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hardline crackdown on dissent, tensions \nescalated between the government and the protesters.\n\nIn mid-2011, the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League respectively issued condemnations of the \nviolence in Syria. As well, the United Nations Human Rights Council called for an independent inquiry into the \nviolent crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile, global leaders were calling for President Assad to step down from power, \ngiven the brutality of the Syrian regime's crackdown on protesters.  In 2012, the bloody crackdown by the Assad \nregime on anti-government protesters was ongoing. In fact, the crackdown appeared to become more relentless in \nplaces such as Homs and Aleppo. Despite widespread condemnation from the West, a United Nations Security \n\n\n\nResolution on the situation in Syria was subject to veto by Russia and China. A subsequent vote in the United \nNations General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Syria for its brutal crackdown. A prevailing truce, brokered \nby the joint United Nations/Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, was established in the interests of preventing further \nbloodshed; however, it was revealed to be an exercise in theory rather than practice and eventually the United \nNations monitoring mission ended in failure.\n\nSyria has meanwhile been subject to sanctions by various countries and was sliding into pariah status in the \ninternational community. Assassinations, alleged  massacres, geopolitical tensions with Turkey and Israel,  and  \nsuspicions about the use of chemical weapons, have since mired the Syrian landscape.  Indeed,  with it was \nincreasingly clear that with President Bashar al-Assad using brutal tactics to quell the uprising  served only to create \nan even more tumultuous landscape, and eventually set the path for a full-blown civil war.\n\nThat civil war pitted the Assad forces, backed by Lebanon-based Hezbollah, against  a disparate cabal of anti-\ngovernment entities, ranging from the rebel Free Syrian Army to several Islamist terrorist enclaves.\n\nAt the same time, Syria  was facing a devastating humanitarian crisis.  That crisis reached new heights in August \n2013 with claims that Syrian forces launched a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus.  Although this was \nthe clear sign that United States President Barack Obama's \"red line\" had definitively been crossed, the \ninternational community remained reticent about becoming more involved in the Syrian crisis. Ultimately, an  \nensuing chemical weapons deal with Syria between the United States and Russia quieted the war drums.\n\nIn the meantime, though, a  highly anticipated  peace summit in Geneva ended without yielding any productive \nresults and the civil war in Syria raged on and on.\n\nBy mid-2014, while Syria had shown progress in its disposal of chemical toxins, in keeping with an international \nagreement intended to avoid intervention by the West, the country was dealing with an ascendant \"Islamic State.\"  \nPreviously known as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS as well as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or ISIL, \nthis group self-declared a caliphate extending from Syria to Iraq.\n\nIt was apparent that the power vacuum from the Syrian civil war provided a breeding ground for extremism that \nIslamic State could exploit and use to both challenge the Assad regime and function as a recruitment tool for \nJihadists.  Whereas the West and regional powers in the Middle East had earlier called for an end to the Assad \nregime, suddenly the geopolitical stakes were quite different as extremist terrorists were now posing the most \ndangerous threat to regional stability.\n\nThe barbaric beheadings of two American journalists by Islamic State in their stronghold in Syria changed the \ncalculus and the Obama administration in the United States -- initially reticent about re-engaging in the Middle East \n-- was now looking at a targeted anti-terrorism strategy in the Syrian-Iraqi landscape of Islamic State.  As such, a \nWestern coalition, led by the United States, was soon carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and \nIraq.  Of note was the fact that the United States-led coalition expanded to include Japan and Jordan when citizens \nof their countries that were being held by Islamic State were also brutally killed.\n\nAs of 2015, Syria was beset by two sets of intersecting challenges -- the ongoing civil war between the Assad \nregime and rebel forces on one end, and the horrific dangers posed by the notorious terror group, Islamic State, \nwhich had seized wide swaths of territory in Syria and left an appalling death toll.  It was generally understood that \nthe civil war conditions in Syria, to some extent, facilitated the emergence of Islamic State in  that country.  Syrian \nPresident Assad's priority to hold onto power, and thus the center of power in Damascus, had allowed a power \nchasm to flourish in other parts of the country, which Islamic State has been able to exploit.  The result has been a \n\n\n\nmass exodus of Syrians fleeing the country and seeking refuge in Europe.  The so-called migrant influx in  Europe \nhas raised questions as to how to legally and humanely deal with a burgeoning humanitarian refugee crisis.\n\nAt the political level, Russia signaled it would be entering the Syrian crisis militarily in September 2015 although it \nwas unclear if Moscow's goal was to  bolster and preserve Bashar al-Assad's hold on power, or, to go after Islamic \nState.  The geopolitical landscape was complicated in October 2015 with the news that the United States would be \ndeploying special operations teams to Syria.  The scene in November 2015 was grave as Russia and France \nintensified their efforts to go after Islamic State targets in Syria following devastating terror attacks by the Islamist \nterror network that killed hundreds of Russian and French citizens.\n\nRussia, France, and the United States were now respectively changing their respective calculations, cognizant that \nthe Islamist terror group was no longer simply seeking to build its Caliphate but, instead, transposing its goals to \nmore of an Islamic Jihadist orientation.  The result was a global security crisis.\n\nSee \"Foreign Relations\" for more details.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nRussia acknowledges that bomb brought down  jet carrying vacationers from Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-\nSheikh; promises retribution against Islamic State\n\nSummary\n\nThe crash of a Russian airliner  in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula resulted in the deaths of  all 224 persons on board.  The \nRussian Metrojet Flight KG9268 departed the Red Sea resort city of Sharm-el-Shekh and was bound for the \nRussian city of St. Petersburg but crashed before the tourists and flight crew could arrive at  their destination.  The \nnotorious terror group, Islamic State, claimed responsibility for the downing of the flight but\n\nEgyptian officials dismissed the claim on the basis of their belief that the terror group did not have the capability to \nbring down a jet.  The Russian government was,  likewise,  reticent to accept terrorism as  explanation. \nNevertheless, both the United States and the United Kingdom made clear that intelligence pointed to a bomb being \nplanted on the aircraft and exploding shortly after taking off from Sharm-el-Sheikh.\n\nWith an affiliate of Islamic State active in the Egyptian Sinai in recent years, and with intelligence pointing in the \ndirection of terrorism,  that group's claim of responsibility was being viewed by the countries of the West as credible.\n\nRussia joined that group's conclusions two weeks after the crash, pointing to explosive material found on crash \ndebris, while Russian President Vladimir Putin promised that those responsible would face justice. The international \ndimension of the tragedy catapulted the global security threat posed by Islamic State to new heights.\n\nIn Detail\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2015, a Russian airliner carrying 224 people crashed in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula about 20 minutes after \ntaking off from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all the persons on board.  While most of those \naboard were Russian citizens, there were also four Ukrainians and one Belarussian national among the victims.\n\nThe Russian Metrojet Flight KG9268 departed the Red Sea city and was bound for the Russian city of St. \nPetersburg but crashed before the tourists and flight crew could arrive at  their destination.\n\n\n\nIt was the deadliest crash of the French-made Airbus A321 airliner in recent times.\n\nAccording to the Egyptian authorities, the aircraft  disappeared from radar approximately 20  minutes after its \ndeparture from Sharm el-Sheikh  while flying over the central Sinai Peninsula  at an altitude of 31,000 feet.  The  \nEgyptian military aircraft later located the wreckage of the aircraft  in an area of the Sinai called  Hasna, just south \nof the Mediterranean coastal town of el-Arish.  Russian officials confirmed that the aircraft split into two in mid-air \nbut refrained from immediately drawing conclusions about the cause of the disaster.\n\nWith both of the aircraft's flight recorders, known as \"black boxes,\" recovered,  along with no shortage of forensic \nevidence, there would be a good foundation for investigators to determine what happened to Metrojet Flight \nKG9268.\n\nTo that end, Egypt would be leading the investigation, which would involve the participation of an international \ngroup of aviation experts.  The Russians were expected to  assist with the inquiry given the fact that its citizens \nmade up the vast majority of the appalling death toll.  Because the aircraft was a French-made Airbus A321, France \nwould also be involved in the investigation into what went wrong.\n\nAs well, an Irish delegation would be part of the investigation since the actual aircraft was registered  in Ireland.\n\nAlthough Egyptian officials initially indicated that there was nothing irregular about the doomed flight and suggested \neither human error or  a mechanical malfunction, Islamist terrorists in the Sinai aligned with the notorious terror \ngroup, Islamic State, claimed responsibility for  downing the flight via a  Telegram messaging application.\n\nEgyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail immediately dismissed the claim, asserting that the terror group did not have \nthe capability to  bring down an aircraft from the type of high altitude Metrojet Flight KG9268 reached at the time it \ndisappeared from radar.\n\nBut in the days after the crash, authorities in the United States and United Kingdom respectively indicated that \nintelligence pointed to the likelihood that Metrojet Flight KG9268 was brought down by a bomb.  Clearly, this \nassertion by two Western countries would vitiate the notion that an Islamic State affiliate in the Sinai used some sort \nof missile to target the aircraft. Instead, attention was  settling on a more conventional methodology for the conduct \nof terrorism -- the use of a bomb, which was likely planted on the aircraft by an airport insider, and which was very \nlikely  programmed to explode when that aircraft reached a certain altitude.\n\nUnited Kingdom  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond did not prevaricate in any way as he made the following \ndeclaration: \"We have concluded that there is a significant possibility that the crash was caused by an explosive \ndevice on board the aircraft.\"  Moreover, the government of the United Kingdom moved to suspend all flights to and \nfrom Sharm-el-Sheikh, while putting plans into place for providing transportation to bring British nationals home \nfrom Egypt, but only after new and stringent security protocols had been put into place. The office of United \nKingdom Prime Minister David Cameron explained the government's decision with the following statement: \"The \nevidence we received suggested there was a credible threat with regard to Sharm al-Sheikh airport which is why we \nhave taken the actions we have.\"  The prime minister's office stopped short of providing information about what \ntypes of security actions would be taken.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, unnamed officials in the United States revealed to various news agencies that  a bomb \" was a \nhighly possible scenario\" and that terrorism was the likely cause of the crash.  Subsequently, United States \nPresident Barack Obama himself noted that there was a possibility that the Russian airliner was brought down by a \n\n\n\nbomb that was planted on board.  To that end, President Obama said, \"We're taking that very seriously.\"  President \nObama's head of homeland security, Jey Johnson,  later noted that new  and more stringent security measures \nwould be implemented at certain airports across the world for aircraft flying into the United States.\n\nOf note was the fact that no United States-registered airlines fly in and out of the  Sharm al-Sheikh airport due to \nenduring concerns about poor security.  As such, the United States Transportation Security Administration has not  \nbeen at that airport in recent times to actually evaluate security there.\n\nPerhaps eager to protect its vital tourism industry, Egypt again dismissed the idea that islamic State terrorists within \nits own borders might be responsible for the tragedy.  Indeed, the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi went so far \nas to disparage Islamic State's claim of responsibility as mere \"propaganda.\"  But on Nov. 4, 2015, another claim of \nresponsibility had been advanced by Islamic State in the Sinai -- this time via an audio message posted on Twitter. \nIn that message, the speaker said: \"We, with God's grace, are the ones who brought it down, and we are not \nobliged to disclose the mechanism of its demise.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russia was likewise distancing itself from the Islamic State and terrorism angle.  With Russia now \nactively participating in the civil war in Syria against both anti-Assad rebels and Islamic State, it was not keen to \nadmit that it might be suffering so quickly from what is generally known as \"blowback\" from its Syrian engagement.  \nStill, the truth of the matter was that if the cause of the crash was ultimately determined to be terrorism at the hands \nof Islamic State, Russia would have to confront the reality that its heavy military footprint in Syria quite possibly was \nyielding deleterious consequences.  Of note was the fact that airplanes from various European countries depart to \nand from Sharm-el-Sheikh daily, yet of all the aircraft available, it was a Russian jetliner which may have been \nselected by Islamic State terrorists as a target.\n\nRegardless of its hesitation in accepting the terrorism explanation for the crash of Metrojet Flight KG9268, Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin ordered all flights to and from Egypt to be halted.\n\nPutin made that decision after a meeting with Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's  security service, in which \nhe recommended that Russia suspend  passenger flights to Egypt until the precise cause of the crash was \ndetermined.  Bortnikov explained the move saying, \"Until we know the real reasons for what happened, I consider it \nexpedient to stop Russian flights to Egypt. Above all, this concerns tourist routes.\"  Arrangements were also made \nto repatriate Russians stranded at the Egyptian resort town.\n\nSeveral other airlines were also taking precautions by  grounding flights scheduled to traverse that route, rerouting \naircraft flying over the Sinai, while several Western governments released travel warnings expressly stating that \ntheir citizens should not travel to the Egyptian Sinai.\n\nNote that as the first week of November 2015 came to a close, authorities in the United States and United Kingdom \nmade clear that their intelligence assets had intercepted communications, known in intelligence circles as \"chatter,\" \nfrom suspected terrorists.  This revelation only bolstered their view that Russian Metrojet Flight KG9268 was the \ntarget of terrorism.\n\nWhile this view would yet have to be proved via forensic evidence and a thorough assessment of information on the \nflight recorders, the  working theory at this time was that a bomb had been hidden in luggage and stowed in the \nhold of the aircraft.  The general belief was that the bomb was quite likely planted by an insider working at the \nSharm-el-Sheikh airport.  That insider was believed to have worked in some form or fashion with Islamic State in \nthe Sinai.\n\nIn the second week of November 2015, Russia and Egypt continued to officially resist the terrorism explanation for \nthe crash of the Russian Metrojet airliner in the Egyptian Sinai.  For Russia, there was no willingness to publicly \n\n\n\nadmit that it was suffering from blowback as a result of its military engagement in Syria.  For Egypt, there was no \ndesire to taint its tourism industry by admitting that the resort city of Sharm-el-Sheikh may have suffered from lax \nsecurity; Egypt was also not eager to confront the reality that despite its hardline measures against Islamist \nmilitants, a likely act of international terrorism  had quite possibly occurred on its soil.  As such, Russia and Egypt \ncontinued to publicly insist that it was too soon to draw conclusions about what happened on Oct. 31, 2015.\n\nIn the same period (the second week of November 2015), Islamic State -- which had already claimed responsibility \nfor bringing down the Russian jet -- was now promising further attacks on Russia.\n\nTo this end,  Islamic State was vowing via a videotaped threat to attack Russians \"very soon\" on Russian soil for \nthat country's heavy involvement in the Syrian crisis.\n\nOn Nov. 17, 2015, after two weeks of avoiding the terrorism explanation for the downing of the Metrojet flight, \nRussian authorities finally acknowledged that \"an act of terror\" in the form of a bomb brought down the plane over \nthe Egyptian Sinai.\n\nRussian authorities reportedly informed President Putin that \"traces of foreign explosives\" were identified  on the \ndebris from the aircraft. Publicly, the head of Russia's  security service, Alexander Bortnikov, said, \"We can \nunequivocally say it was a terrorist act.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the government of Egypt continued to insist that it would not arrive at premature conclusions \nand would let the the investigatory process be fully completed.  Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said, \"The \nEgyptian authorities affirm they will take into consideration the investigations that the Russian side reached ... in the \ncomprehensive investigation.\"  Egyptian  Interior Minister Magid Abdel Ghaffar went slightly further, noting that \nthere would be consequences if the investigation indicated security lapses at the Sharm el-Sheikh airport.  He said, \n\"Regarding Sharm al-Sheikh airport, when we discover that there have been security lapses action will be taken, \nbut up to now we have no information about lapses in the search and security procedures.\"  Egypt's Civil Aviation \nMinister Hosam Kamel, however, would not even concede that anything nefarious had occurred, as he said,  \"Up \nuntil this moment, there is no evidence of crime.\"\n\nNote that on Nov. 18, 2015, Islamic State released details regarding their claim of responsibility in the Russian \nMetrojet disaster.  In the terror group's Dabiq  magazine, Islamic State explained that its operatives used its liquids \nbomb manufacturing capability, hidden in a  canned Schweppes soft drink, to bring down the doomed jetliner.  That \nliquids bomb making capability has been known to global anti-terrorism experts since 2006 following an \ninvestigation by MI6 experts from the United Kingdom, which has led to regulations on carry-on liquids belonging to \naircraft passengers.\n\nIn this message from Islamic State, the terror group said,  \"The divided Crusaders of the East and West thought \nthemselves safe in their jets as they cowardly bombarded the Muslims of the Caliphate. And so revenge was \nexacted upon those who felt safe in the cockpits.\"\n\nRussia's Official Response\n\nWith Islamic State claiming responsibility for the fatal crash, Russian President Vladmir Putin promised to \"find and \npunish\" those responsible for the attack over the Sinai peninsula.  He said, \"We'll look for them everywhere, \nwherever they are hiding. We'll find them in any corner of the planet and punish them.\"  The Russian leader warned \nthat those who carried out the attack that led to the deaths of more than 200 Russians, or were in anyway complicit \nin helping them,  would face justice as he declared, \"We must do this without any statute of limitations and we must \n\n\n\nfind out all their names. Anyone who tries to help the criminals should know that the consequences for trying to \nshelter them will lie completely on their shoulders.\"\n\nPresident Putin also made it clear that his country's military engagement in Syria would not only continue, but that \nRussian air strikes \"must be intensified so that the criminals understand that retribution is inevitable.\"\n\nTo that end, Russian warplanes wasted no time before stepping up its air campaign in Syria. The Russian \ngovernment was also signaling its interest in working with France, which was also struck with a spate of terrorist \nattacks at the hands of Islamic State in the French capital of Paris.  Indeed, both countries were reported to be \ncarrying out sustained air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria.  As well, despite strained relations with the \nUnited States,  as a result of their shared interest in defeating Islamic State,  Russian and United States forces \nwere said to be more closely coordinating their respective strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nTies between  Turkey and Russia erode after Russian-Turkish  jet shoot down crisis\n\nIn the last week of November 2015, the geopolitical complexity of Syrian civil war grew more complicated when \nTurkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the basis of accusations that the Russian aircraft violated Turkish air \nspace.\n\nWhen the crew ejected from the doomed aircraft, one pilot was shot to death by extremists on the ground in Syria  \nas he parachuted to the ground.  There was another fatality as a  Russian special operations officer dispatched to \nrescue the crew was also  killed by extremists on the ground.  Only the pilot of the doomed jet survived the ordeal.\n\nAccording to Turkish authorities, the Russian aircraft was notified  multiple times of its territorial violation before it \nwas shot down.  In an attempt to bolster its account of the tragic events, Turkey released an apparent audio \nrecording of its warnings to the Russian  jet before it was shot down.\n\nOn the recording,  the following warning was stated:  \"Change your heading.\"\n\nTurkey also explained that its protocols in cases of territorial encroachment had been followed and its personnel \nattempted to  rescue the Russian pilots.\n\nFor his part, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan issues no apology for the downing of the Russian jet.  Instead, \nErdogan declared that his country was defending its own security and sovereignty.\n\nRussia disputed Turkey's claim, insisting that the jet was operating in Syrian air space as part of the fight against \nIslamic State.  Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to the tragic incident as a betrayal administered by \"the \naccomplices of terrorists,\" and  warned that Moscow's relations with Ankara would suffer as a result.  He said, \n\"Today's loss is linked to a stab in the back delivered to us by accomplices of terrorists. I cannot qualify what \nhappened today as anything else.\"\n\nHe added, \"We will of course analyze everything that happened and today's tragic events will have serious \nconsequences for Russo-Turkish relations.\"\n\nSoon thereafter, the Russian government  instituted sanctions against Turkey.  Russia also remained defiant, \nmaking clear it would continue its effort in the Syrian crisis and against Islamic State. A spokesperson from the \n\n\n\nRussian Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, noted that Russian jets  would continue to fly missions close to the Turkish border \nbecause that was simply where the Islamist extremists were  located.\n\nIt should be noted that the Russian president also blasted Turkey for being lax in its border controls, essentially \nallowing Islamic State terrorists to move across the Turkish border to and from Syria with virtual impunity, benefiting \nfrom its transportation and sales of oil revenues.  Putin said, \"We established a long time ago that large quantities \nof oil and oil products from territory captured by Islamic State have been arriving on Turkish territory. And now we \nget stabbed in our back and our planes, which are fighting terrorism, are struck. This despite the fact that we signed \nan agreement with our American partners to warn each other about air-to-air incidents and Turkey ... announced it \nwas allegedly fighting against terrorism as part of the U.S. coalition.\"\n\nWith Turkey being a NATO member, Russia's wrath could potentially affect all Western countries participating in the \nUnited States-led coalition fighting Islamic State in the region.  Hopes for greater cooperation between the West \nand Russia against the terror group were thus dimmed.  In a small positive sign, however, both Moscow and Ankara \nmade clear that they were not interested in escalating tensions and facilitating the path of war.\n\nAs well,  despite being NATO allies, France and the United States called on Turkey to do a better job of monitoring \nits borders which Islamic State terrorists were using to traverse in and out of Syria.  Of particular note was a stretch \nof the Syrian-Turkish border north of the Syrian city of Aleppo where Turkey had not closed and was being used by \nthe terror group to transport militants and supplies.\n\nOf course, the truth of the matter was that neither Turkey nor Russia has been involved in the Syrian civil war for \nthe principal purpose of fighting Islamic State in the first place.  Turkey was one of the initial voices calling for \nBashar Assad to go and has directly supported Sunni rebel groups fighting the Assad regime in Syria.  At the same \ntime, Turkey has exploited the excuse of fighting Islamic State to instead go after Kurdish extremists, which  it \ndeems to be a political threat.  On the other side of the equation, Russia has been a long-time backed of the Assad \nregime, and has often treated Syria like a client state.  Russia entered the Syrian quagmire on the basis of claims \nthat it was fighting Islamic State but it, instead, hit rebel targets in Syrian territory that were opposed to the Assad \nregime.  In many senses, Turkey and Russia were already in opposed political \"camps\" with regard to the Syrian \ncrisis before the latest contretemps over Turkey shooting down a Russian jet.\n\nIn December 2015, in the aftermath of Turkey's decision to shoot-down a Russian jet, ties between the two \ncountries eroded further.  At issue was  Turkey's claim  that a marine aboard a Russian naval ship  was \naggressively displaying a missile launcher as the Caesar Kunikov vessel sailed through the Bosphorus in  Istanbul.  \nTurkey summoned the Russian envoy for consultations as a result.  As well,  the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut \nCavusoglu cast the incident as a provocation, saying, \"The showing off of a missile by a soldier on a Russian \nwarship, or other things such as anti-aircraft weapons, is pure provocation.\"  The Russian Foreign Ministry \ndismissed Turkey's concerns, with spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, citing the 1936 Montreux Convention, which \nregulates ship movements through the Bosphorus Straits, and  declaring that  \"the protection of a ship is the legal \nright of any crew.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a Russian news crew was arrested in Turkey's Hatay province  on the  border with Syria and \nsubsequently deported.  That action was not expected to help improve already-damaged bilateral ties between the \ntwo countries.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nPublic inquiry concludes ex-spy Litvinenko likely poisoned with Russian President Putin's approval\n\n\n\nIn January 2016, a public inquiry into the death of a former  Russian clandestine agent, Alexander Litvinenko,  \nconcluded with some disturbing findings.  It should be noted that  after unveiling an alleged plot to assassinate a \nRussian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, Litvinenko sought asylum in the United Kingdom, and went onto to work for the \nBritish MI6 intelligence service.\n\nHe died in a London hospital in 2006 where it was confirmed that he succumbed to olonium-210-induced acute \nradiation syndrome.\n\nAn inquest was launched in the United Kingdom where Litvinenko was killed, and was chaired by Sir Robert  \nOwen.  It came to a conclusion with the production of the 300-page Litvinenko report.  Of significance in the so-\ncalled \"Sir Robert report\" was the assessment that  Litvinenko was poisoned to death with radioactive polonium-210 \nat the hands of Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, who were working under the aegis of Russia's Federal Security \nService, and quite likely at the behest of  Russian President Putin.\n\nIndeed, the report also \"antagonism\" between Putin and Litvinenko, which may have been part of the motivation for \nthe killing.\n\nKovtun denied the alleged role in the death of Litvinenko.  For his part, Lugovoi, who had since gone on to serve in \nthe Russian parliament and thus would enjoy immunity from prosecution, dismissed the conclusions of the report.  \nIn fact, he cast the findings as \"invention\" and \"supposition,\" and accusing Sir Robert of having \"gone mad.\"\n\nBoth men, however, would see their assets frozen by the United Kingdom government, while British officials \nindicated that the matter would also be brought up with Russian President Putin.\n\nSpecial Note\n\nPeace Progress and Obstacles in Syria\n\nAt the start of 2016, the United  Nations announced that the Syrian peace talks had commenced in the Swiss city of \nGeneva, with delegates from the opposition and representatives from the Assad regime meeting with  United \nNations Envoy Staffan de Mistura.  The two sides were not at the same table for these negotiations; instead, these \n\"proximity talks\" were ensuing in separate rooms.  It should be noted that the peace talks occurred even as Syria's \npro-Assad forces, backed by Russian air strikes, were carrying out a massive offensive operation close to Aleppo.  \nSyrian rebels pointed to the fact that this operation was going on despite the understanding that such actions \nshould cease in order to give the peace process a chance.  \n\nIn mid-February 2016, United States Secretary of State John Kerry announced that an agreement had been forged \nto seek a cessation of hostilities in Syria, and which would set the path for humanitarian aid to be transported to \nwar-torn cities.  Despite this favorable development, the fact of the matter was that Russian air power continued to \nstrike targets in Syria deemed to be enemies of the Assad regime.  As well, Syrian President Assad was \nintensifying his forces' efforts to regain control over Aleppo, which he indicated would only be the start of a national \ncampaign to retake control of the country.  Secretary of State  Kerry thus warned that the aforementioned \nagreement to end hostilities would only remain relevant if Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies made good on \ntheir commitments. \n\nBy the  last week of February 2016, the United States and Russia appeared to have reached some concurrence \nand issued a joint statement announcing that the ceasefire would commence on Feb. 27, 2016 and would apply to \nall parties in the Syrian conflict, with  terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and al-Nusra being the exceptions.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\n\n\nRussian build-up in Ukraine raises questions about military and geopolitical  ambitions\n\nIn mid-August 2016, questions were surfacing about Russia's ambitions in Ukraine.  At issue was a build-up of \nforces and military equipment in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 following Ukraine's Maidan revolution that \nended in the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych -- a stalwart of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlso at issue was the intensifying fighting in the predominantly Russian-speaking eastern region of Donbas.\n\nBy the third week of August 2016, up to 2,500 Russian military forces were carrying out \"logistical exercises\" on the \nCrimean  Peninsula.  Russian state media indicated that the drills were for training purposes and aimed at \ntransposing troops and military equipment from Russia to Crimea.  The drills would also serve as a precursor for \nmore massive war games  to be carried out in September 2016.\n\nRussia was explaining its stronger military presence in the region as a preventative move against acts of terrorism \nby Ukrainians.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian government has denied any such possibility, insisting that Russia was aiming for \naggressive action, as it said, \"The enemy is planning large-scale provocative actions.\"\n\nObservers were speculating whether Russia would use the increased tensions in the region as a justification to \ncarry out an assault there, capture the port city of Mariupol, and thus secure a route  through to Crimea.  Such a \nroute would be of strategic value to Russia, given the land access to the Black Sea.\n\nThere was also political value in spurring an altercation with Ukraine ahead of elections due to take place in \nRussia.  Experts noted that a military victory for Russia against Ukraine would bolster nationalist sentiment that \nwould simultaneously boost Putin's political cachet.\n\nYet another theory centered on the view that the threat of an offensive into Ukraine might be a strategy from \nMoscow.  That strategy would aim to place pressure on the international community, thus compelling them to lift \nsome of the economic sanctions that were imposed on Russia after the annexation of the Crimea.  Such a move \nwould certainly  advance trade relations -- something needed to repair Russia's ailing economy.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nUkraine investigating charges of corruption involving top  Trump Adviser\n\nIn mid-August 2016, the New York Times -- in a bombshell story -- reported that handwritten ledgers were found in \nthe Ukrainian capital of Kiev that linked Paul Manafort, the chairman of Republican Donald Trump's presidential \ncampaign, to more than $12 million in undisclosed cash payments.\n\nThe payments in the so-called \"black ledger\" appeared to have been dispatched during a period when Manafort \nserved as an adviser to the government of the ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The documents also \nseemed to link Manafort with the Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.  There was also a dubious connection involving \nthe purchase of Ukrainian cable television assets.\n\nAs such, Ukraine's National Anti-corruption Bureau was investigating the ledgers to see if they constituted evidence \nof  corruption within the former Yanukovych regime. Of note was the fact that Yanukovych was considered a \nstalwart of the Russian Kremlin.\n\n\n\nBy the third week of August 2016, a Ukrainian member of parliament, Serhiy Leshchenko, indicated that payments \nto Manafort were made by the Party of Regions -- the political party of Yanukovych. According to Leshchenko, the \npayments to Manafort were geared towards financing technological equipment, research services, and election \npolling.\n\nDuring a news conference, Leshchenko, a member of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's parliamentary bloc, \nsaid, \"Manafort didn't work for free in Ukraine, he served the Party of Regions for over 10 years and it is clear that \nhis work was paid.\" He elaborated, \"The money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the \ntransactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents.\"\n\nFor his part, Manafort denied the allegations about him. He declared, \"I have never received a single off-the-books \ncash payment as falsely reported by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of \nUkraine or Russia.\" But Leshchenko reacted to this assertion by stating. \"If Mr Manafort denies any allegations, I \nthink he has to be interrogated into this case and prove his position that he was not involved.\"\n\nAround the same period -- the third week of August 2016 -- the Associated Press (AP) said it has obtained emails \nindicating that Manafort's company, which had lobbied for Yanukovych, likely did not meet legal requirements. At \nissue was the lack of disclosure by Manafort in regard to its efforts to advocate and lobby public opinion on behalf of \nYanukovych. According to the AP, United States law would require Manafort's firm to register and disclose in detail \nits role as a foreign agent to the Justice Department.\n\nNote:  In the background of these developments were accusations that Russia had interfered with the 2016 \nelections in the United States.  Please see section below for details. \n\nPrimer on parliamentary elections in Russia\n\nA parliamentary election in Russia was scheduled to take place on Sept. 18, 2016. Although the Russian Federal \nAssembly, known as the Federalnoye Sobraniye, was a bicameral entity composed of the  Sovyet Federatsiyi \n(Federation Council) and the Gosudarstvennaya Duma (State Duma), in fact, only the 450 seats in the State Duma \nwere up for election. Typically, members of the State Duma are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.\n\nIt should be noted that the United Russia Party of President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin \nhave dominated Russian politics and hoped to continue their ascendancy in 2016.\n\nThe last elections were held in December 2011.  Clearly, United Russia hoped to continue its reign on supremacy \nand won the most votes in 2011 -- albeit just shy of 50 percent of the vote share, but still managing to control 238 of \nthe 450 seats at stake. The closeness of that contest produced rare dissent in Russia with a rare show of street \nprotests. Anti-government demonstrators were claiming that the elections were flawed and subject to both vote \nrigging and ballot box stuffing.\n\nNevertheless, in 2016, with a burst of nationalist sentiment -- much of it emanating from the conflict in Ukraine and \nthe annexation of Crimea -- the political landscape in Russia was quite different.  Indeed, the ruling powers were \nriding high with  greater popular support, even if that expressed support was produced from some degree of an \nincreasingly autocratic and propaganda-ridden political climate.  Of note was the role of the state media in \nreinforcing President Putin's Russian leadership as a counterpoint to Western influence, along with a genuine \nnationalist zeal for Putin's vision of reconstituting the Soviet empire in some form or fashion.\n\nNot surprisingly, once the ballots were counted in 2016, Putin's ruling United Russia party had secured about 75 \npercent of the parliamentary seats and 343 seats of the total of 450 in the Duma, according to the Central Election \nCommission said. This result was a significant consolidation of power at the legislative power for the ruling party. \n\n\n\nThis result also translated into the augmentation of Putin's power and influence over the entire Russian political \nscene.\n\nThe opposition reacted by declaring that the vote had been neither free nor fair -- a view backed up by international \nmonitors.  Meanwhile, Reuters News reported that its reporters on the ground in Russia witnessed ballot-stuffing, \ninflated turnout figures, and repeated voting by people at various polling stations.\n\nClaims from the opposition and warnings from the international community that the vote may not have been free or \nfair would have little bearing on the internal political landscape where Putin was entrenching his autocratic \nleadership.\n\nRussian ambassador to Turkey assassinated in Ankara; Russia and Turkey form fragile Syrian ceasefire \n\nIn December 2016,  the Russian ambassador to  Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was assassinated in the Turkish capital city \nof Ankara.  The assailant was identified as a Turkish policeman, Mevlut Mert Altintas, who was reportedly protesting \nRussia's involvement in the Syrian regime's bombardment of the flashpoint city, Aleppo.  \n\nThe gruesome scene of the assassination was recorded on video and showed Karolov being shot to death by \nAltinas, who screamed \"don't forget about Aleppo, don't forget about Syria.\" He was shot to death by Turkish police \nshortly thereafter.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin \nthat the act was one of \"provocation\" intended to damage ties between their two countries.\n\nIn his own address at home  in Russia, Putin appeared to echo that sentiment, starting that the killing of Karlov was \naimed at disrupting bilateral ties and the peace process in Syria.\n\nIt should be noted that in the week after the horrific assassination of Karlov, Russia and Turkey agreed to a \nceasefire plan for Syria.\n\nThe plan was announced on Dec. 29, 2016 and involved a truce between the Syrian government and rebel \nopposition, with Russia and Turkey acting as the guarantors.  Significantly, the United States was not a party to the \nagreement.\n\nSpecial Report: U.S. officials accuse Russia of trying to interfere in and influence presidential election\n\n- Russia accused of hacking of election databases and DNC in order to influence U.S. election\n\n- U.S. intelligence investigating ties between Trump advisers and Russian Kremlin\n\n- U.S. officials promises proportional response to Russian hacking activity\n\n- Intelligence indicates inference from Russian government in the political affairs of the United States\n\n-  U.S. President Barack Obama sanctions Russia for interfering in 2016 presidential election\n\n- U.S. intelligence notifies Obama and Trump of allegations that Russia holds compromising information about \nTrump\n\nRussia accused of hacking of election databases and DNC in order to influence U.S. election --\n\nIn late August 2016, it was reported that two state election databases had been penetrated and United States \nofficials indicated that  Russian hackers were responsible.\n\n\n\nWhile the two states were not formally named, media outlets indicated that Illinois and Arizona were the targeted \nstates.  In the Illinois case,  the voter registration system was breached as hackers stole personal information on \napproximately 200,000 voters.  In the Arizona case, the voter registration system as subject to malicious software. \n These cybercrimes were the latest in a stream of many attributed to Russia.\n\nBy October 2016,  United States officials were saying that Russia had hacked into the Florida state electoral \nsystem.\n\nGoing back to July 2016, the United States government said that cyber attacks on the Democratic National \nCommittee were likely carried out by the Russian government.\n\nWhile Russia has denied any such activity,  United States officials made clear that Russia appeared to be trying to \ninfluence the United states 2016 presidential election.\n\nNote that in an interview with Bloomberg News, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied his country's involvement \nin the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.  He said, \"I don't know anything about it...and on a state level \nRussia has never done this.\"  Putin added, \"Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?\"\n\nU.S. intelligence investigating ties between Trump adviser and Russian Kremlin --\n\nAt the close of September 2016, United States media reported that intelligence officials in that country were \ninvestigating whether an American businessman had spurious ties to the Russian Krelim.  Carter Page, a former \ninvestment banker and an adviser to Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, was believed to have \nengaged in communications with high ranking Russian government officials.  These communications involved \ndiscussions of the lifting of economic sanctions against Russia under a Trump presidency but also extended to \nsuspected efforts by Russia to influence the United States presidential election. On the record, Page was known to \nhave made no shortage of pro-Russian statements that undermined the Obama administration's policy regarding \nRussia,  particularly with regard to the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.\n\nOf concern for United States legislators who were briefed on the matter was the possibility of a Trump insider \nworking with Russia to undermine United States foreign policy.  To this end, two ranking Democrats in Congress, \nSenator  Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff released a joint statement  asserting that their briefings \ndid, indeed, indicate an effort by Russian influence to play a role in the United States election. Their joint statement \nread, \"Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making \na serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election.\" They added, \"At the least, this effort is intended to \nsow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.\"\n\nU.S. officials accuse Russia of seeking to interfered with U.S. election; promises proportional response --\n\nAt the start of October 2016, United States intelligence officials issued an unprecedented announcement, asserting \nthat Russia was seeking \"to interfere with the U.S. election process\" by hacking political organizations and key \nindividuals. As discussed in Section 1 of this report, United States officials had already indicated that Russia was \nlikely behind the hacking of state election databases and the Democratic National Committee.  Now, they were \ngoing further to make it clear by \"naming and shaming\" Russia for its role in violating the privacy of internal \ncommunications systems and seeking to influence the United States election.\n\nThe issue had political implications with the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying during \nthe second presidential debate, \"We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an \nadversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.\"  Her rival, Republican \nnominee, Donald Trump, had a different view and instead appeared to defend Russia, as he said. \"She doesn't \nknow if it's the Russians doing the hacking.  Maybe there is no hacking.\" It was possible that Trump genuinely did \nnot believe that Russia was behind the interference into the United States system due to his allegiance to Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin.  However, as a presidential contender, Trump received classified intelligence briefings, \nwhich undoubtedly included evidence of the Russian hacking scheme.\n\n\n\nHis continued advocacy on behalf of Russia has thus raised questions about the Republican nominee's \ncommitment to United States national security interests.\n\nThere remained some debate as to whether the Putin government in Russia was merely seeking to undermine the \npublic's trust in the United States system with its hacking activity, or, if it was outright seeking to facilitate a Trump \npresidency.  There was some suggestion of the latter motivation in three arenas.  Stated differently, there were \nsigns that Putin and Russia favored a Trump presidency and were willing to nudge things in that direction.\n\nFirst, leaked emails and speech excerpts clearly aimed at damaging Clinton, such as that of her campaign \nchairman John Podesta,  have been linked to Russia through the WikiLeaks website.  The timing of the leaks \nseemed geared towards hurting Democrats, and particularly the Democratic nominee, with no equivalent leaks \nrelated to the Republican nominee.  This, in and of itself, suggested that Wikileaks was hardly an entity \nchampioning modern transparency but one with a particularized political agenda.  Second, an ultra-nationalist \nstalwart of Putin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, made clear in an interview with  Reuters news that Trump was the only \nperson able to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington. By contrast, he suggested a Clinton presidency \ncould spark World War III. Zhirinovsky's stance could well be interpreted as a proxy opinion from the Putin regime \nitself that it favors a Trump presidency.  Third,  Trump himself in the second presidential debate expressed a foreign \npolicy on Syria, for example, that was in lockstep with that of Putin, while eschewing that of his own running mate, \nMike Pence.\n\nIntelligence indicates inference from Russian government in the political affairs of the United States --\n\nIn December 2016, United States intelligence officials  concluded that with \"a high level of confidence\" that Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin was personally involved in a clandestine Russian operation to interfere in the United States \npresidential election.\n\nAs reported by NBC News, intelligence findings indicated that  Putin was personally involved in deciding how \nhacked material on  Democrats was leaked and exploited to harm the prospects of Democratic presidential \ncontender, Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to United States intelligence, Putin's motivation was sparked by a  \"vendetta\" against Hillary Clinton. That \nrevenge impulse was due to her criticism of parliamentary elections in Russia that resulted in a close result for the \nRussian president's party years earlier.  But that vendetta was soon transformed into a wider effort to create \ndivisions with United States allies, undermine American influence and authority on the global scene, while \nfomenting dissension at home in the United States by creating the impression of a corrupt political system in the \nUnited States.  All of these trajectories would have the collective effect of strengthening Russia's hand \ninternationally.\n\nAccording to CIA reports, the concrete findings were that the  Russian government wanted to damage Clinton's \ncandidacy while helping to elect Donald Trump.  Knowing that  it would only be possible for Russia's highest \nranking  officials to have authorized these activities, it was clear that Putin was directing the operation.\n\nIn interviews with media, Michael McFaul,  ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014,  noted that these findings \nwere consistent with understanding of the Russian leader.  He said, \"It is most certainly consistent with the Putin \nthat I have watched and used to work with when I was an ambassador and in the government.\"  He added of Putin, \n\"He has had a vendetta against Hillary Clinton, that has been known for a long time because of what she said \nabout his elections back in the parliamentary elections of 2011. He wants to discredit American democracy and \nmake us weaker in terms of leading the liberal democratic order. And most certainly he likes President-elect \n Trump.\"\n\nIn late December 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  co-authored a report with the Department of \nHomeland Security in which it blamed  Russian intelligence services for interfering in the 2016 United States \npresidential election. Included in the report was evidence in the form of\n\nsamples of malicious computer code  used in a  hacking scheme dating back to 2015.\n\n\n\nThere was also a linkage between Russian intelligence and the hacking of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 a \nmove that was believed to have influenced the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile Russia has throughout denied the hacking allegations, it was apparent that the United States government \nhad a decisive view on the problematic role played by Moscow.  Indeed, the issue has come to embody the nadir in \nU.S.-Russian relations in decades.\n\nU.S. President Obama sanctions Russia for interfering in 2016 presidential election --\n\nOn the same day that the aforementioned FBI report was released, United States President Barack Obama \nannounced several retaliatory measures against Russia for its interference activities and warned of more to come. \n Of note was the sanctioning of Russian intelligence and military services, and the expulsion of 35 Russian \nintelligence operatives.\n\nAs well,  in response to the harassment against American diplomats in Moscow, the U.S. closed two Russian \nintelligence gathering compounds in New York and Maryland.\n\nIn a statement, President Obama said, \"These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have \nissued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests \nin violation of established international norms of behavior.\"  He added, \"These actions are not the sum total of our \nresponse to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our \nchoosing, some of which will not be publicized.\"  The United States leader also said that his administration would \nsoon deliver a report to the Congress detailing the Russian interference effort in the 2016 election.\n\nOf significance has been President-elect Donald Trump's reticence to accept the findings of Russian interference \nfrom U.S. intelligence agencies.  Also of note has been Trump's curious effusive praise  for Russian President \nVladimir Putin \u2014 especially at a time when the sitting U.S. President Barack Obama was in the process of \nsanctioning Russia.  Via the social media outlet, Twitter, Trump lauded the Russia president's decision to delay his \nown retaliatory actions, saying, \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\"\n\nFor his part, Putin responded to the news by saying, \"We will not expel anyone\" and indicating he would wait for the \nincoming Trump administration to react as he said, \"Further steps towards the restoration of Russian-American \nrelations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of President D. Trump will carry out.\"\n\nBy the start of 2017, a declassified report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence concludes that Russia \nundertook an effort sought to help elect Trump by  undermining the credibility of Clinton.\n\nKey points of that report were as follows:\n\n\"Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's \nlongstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a \nsignificant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.\"\n\n\"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential \nelection. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, \nand harm her electability and potential presidency.\"\n\n\"We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\"\n\nOf those three findings above, the writers noted \"We have high confidence in these judgments.\"\n\nThe report also declared the following:\n\n\n\n\"We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances \nwhen possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\"\n\nOf those findings above, the writers noted \"All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high \nconfidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.\"\n\nFurther findings of the report were as follows:\n\n\"When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign \nbegan to focus more on undermining her future presidency.\"\n\n\"Further information has come to light since Election Day that, when combined with Russian behavior since early \nNovember 2016, increases our confidence in our assessments of Russian motivations and goals.\"\n\nIn terms of strategy, the writers of the report made the following observation:\n\n\"Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations \u2014 \nsuch as cyber activity \u2014 with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party \nintermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls'.\"\n\nRead the full report here: https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\n\nFor his part, Trump has dismissed such suggestions, at one point suggesting a technologically savvy teenager may \nhave been responsible for cybersecurity violations, or even China, which was blamed for previous hacking \noperations.  But throughout, Trump has been reluctant to place the blame on Russia, and instead referred to the \nentire line of inquiry as \"a political witch hunt.'\n\nFollowing a briefing from United States intelligence, Trump continued to downplay the role of Russian actors in his \nelection, declaring instead:  \"There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that \nthere was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\"\n\nMeanwhile, outgoing President Barack Obama admitted in an interview with ABC News that he \"underestimated\" \nthe impact of the  apparent Russian campaign of misinformation and computer hacking, as well as its effects on a \ndemocracy.  President Obama said, \"I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, \nit is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open \nsystems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating.\"\n\nPresident Obama also warned against the close ties with Russia promised by Trump, as he said,  \"One of the \nthings that I am concerned about is the degree to which we've seen a lot of commentary lately where there were, \nthere are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seemed to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin \nthan fellow Americans because those fellow Americans were Democrats. That cannot be.  We have to remind \nourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin's not on our team. If we get to a point where people in this \ncountry feel more affinity with a leader who is an adversary and view the United States and our way of life as a \nthreat to him, then we're gonna have bigger problems than just cyber hacking.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence notifies Obama and Trump of allegations that Russia holds compromising information about Trump \n--\n\nThe issue of Russian interference into the United States political system took a dark and twisted turn on Jan. 10, \n2016, when  CNN reported that classified documents presented to  both President Obama and  Trump included \nallegations that Russian operatives had compromising  personal and financial information about the president-elect.\n\nThe report also included an explosive suggestion of an exchange of information during the campaign between \nTrump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.\n\n\nThese allegations outlined in the intelligence report  given to Obama and Trump were derived partially \u2014 but not \ncompletely \u2014 from memos of a former credible British intelligence operative.  However, there were indications that \nthere were other sources of the \"kompromat\"  leak.\n\nIt was unknown if the salacious details of the \"kompromat\"  leak constituted the reference point for then-Senate \nDemocratic Leader Harry Reid, who dispatched a letter to Director James Comes of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation in October 2016 that read as follows: \"It has become clear that you possess explosive information \nabout close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -- a \nforeign interest openly hostile to the United States.\"  Reid urged Comey to release this information, which the FBI \ndirector clearly opted not to do.\n\nFor his part,  Trump dismissed the claims that Russia had compromising information about him.  Via the social \nmedia outlet, Twitter, he declared,  \"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.\"\n\nBut Trump would have a difficult time maintaining the claim that the allegations outlined by CNN were fake once the \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, acknowledged it on the record on Jan. 11, 2017.\n\nThe outgoing DNI head released a statement that read:  \"This evening, I had the opportunity to speak with \nPresident-elect Donald Trump to discuss recent media reports about our briefing last Friday. I expressed my \nprofound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely \ncorrosive and damaging to our national security.\"  In so doing, Clapper was essentially confirming that the \n\"kompromat\"  information did exist and had circulated through the government, the intelligence agencies, and the \nmedia.\n\nTrump picks fight with CIA chief eliciting criticism from Brennan --\n\nMeanwhile Trump was embroiled in a public fight with the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  Director \nJohn Brennan.  The conflict was sparked when Trump accused Brennan of leaking the \"kompromat\" information, \ndetailing tawdry sexual activities in Moscow, to the public.  Brennan not only dismissed those charges but also \nwarned Trump that he would have to be responsible about national security and not just tweet about it.  Brennan \nadditionally warned that Trump's impulsive tendencies could be a detriment to national security.\n\nTrump retaliated by accusing Brennan of being behind the leaked report of Trump's alleged sexual activities \nregistered by Russia.  Via Twitter, Trump asked, \"Was this the leaker of Fake News?\"\n\nBut Brennan had his own advice for Trump, who was again displaying a penchant for public fights on social media. \n Brennan said in an interview with Fox News of the incoming president,\n\n\"Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests and so, therefore, when he speaks or when \nhe reacts, just make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound.\" \n Brennan also expressed doubt that Trump understood the threat to national security posed by Russia, as he said, \n\"I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions and actions.\"\n\nIn the background of these developments was a bipartisan push by the United States Senate to impose \ncomprehensive sanctions on Russia in response to its alleged attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. \n As well, a Senate intelligence committee inquiry was in the offing about the Russian interference angle \u2014 a \nmeasure likely to take on greater importance given the revelations that Trump adviser, Flynn, had at least five \nconversations with a Russian envoy.\n\nForeign Policy Note: Trump says NATO is obsolete; Russia welcomes that assessment\n\nThe incoming Trump administration in the United States telegraphed compatible geopolitical interests with Russia, \nespecially with regard to the security alliance NATO.  For some time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has \nsignaled distaste for NATO's influence in Europe \u2014 particularly in eastern European countries once under the \ncontrol of the United Soviet Socialist Republic.  There was , thus, no secret that Putin wished to see diminished \n\n\n\nNATO power in the region.  Trump's repeated disparagement of NATO, including his declaration in 2016 and again \nin January 2017 that the security body was \"obsolete\" indicated a  merging of interests between the two former \nCold War rivals.\n\nIn an interview with the media in January 2017, Trump said, \"I took such heat, when I said NATO was obsolete. It's \nobsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying \nTrump is right.\"  He also suggested that smaller NATO countries were not paying enough for protection from United \nStates.\n\nHe said, \"A lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to \nthe United States.\"  Left unsaid by Trump was the fact that many of those small NATO countries sent forces to \nAfghanistan to fight al Qaida after the United States was attacked in 2001.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia welcomed Trump's characterization of NATO as \"obsolete.\"  Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry \nPeskov, reacted by saying,  \"NATO is indeed a vestige [of the past] and we agree with that.\"  Peskov added, \n \"Considering that [NATO] is focused on confrontation and its entire structure is devoted to the ideals of \nconfrontation, then, of course, this can hardly be called a modern structure meeting the ideas of stability, \nsustainable development, and security.\"\n\nThe merging of United States and Russian interests was also brought into high relief when Trump suggested that \nhe might end some economic sanctions against Russia in exchange for a nuclear arms reduction deal.\n\nWhile this notion was being interpreted as a sign of trump's claimed \"deal making\" acumen, the Russian Kremlin \nquickly dismissed the notion of such an agreement.  At first, the Kremlin said that it was premature to respond to \nTrump's offer of such a deal, but later Russian lawmakers indicated that there would be no security concessions \nmade in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nMetro attack in St. Petersburg metro kills 11; suspect believed to be from Central Asia\n\nOn April 3, 2017, an explosion on an underground metro train in the Russian city of St. Petersburg left 11 people \ndead and more than 40 others injured.  The blast, which occurred close to the  stop at the Tekhnologichesky Institut \nstation, was linked with an explosive device  discovered at another station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya.\n\nThe attack was attributed to a suspect in his early 20s, quite likely from Central Asia and with radical Islamic beliefs. \nRussian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said via the social media outlet, Facebook, that the explosion was a \n\"terrorist attack.\"  Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that the cause of the attack would be  investigated. One \npossible angle was an Islamic State-inspired terror group acting to avenge Russian airstrikes in Syria.  A second \npossible angle was that the attack was carried out by militant  Chechen separatists, which have long been active in \nRussia with regard to terrorism.\n\nPrime Minister May retaliates after nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spies in UK\n\nMarch 2018 was marked by international spy intrigue worthy of a motion picture movie.  At issue were the alleged \nassassination attempt by Russia on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy living in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and \nhis daughter, Yulia Skripal.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May publicly accused Russia of being behind the attempted assassination, casting it \nas \"an unlawful use of force\" by the Russian state against the United Kingdom, and warning of consequences to \nfollow if Russia did not answer for its actions by a specified deadline on March 13, 2018.  She declared: \"We will not \ntolerate such brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.\"\n\n\n\nFor its part, Russia dismissed the charges and indicated that it would not be adhering to any such deadline to \nfurnish an explanation.  Moreover, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov  asserted that Moscow was \"not to \nblame\" and asked for information about the nerve agent believed to have caused the poisoning of Skripal and his \ndaughter. \n\nIt should be noted that the particular nerve agent used against Skripal and his daughter was linked with a \nconstellation of chemical weapons identified as Novichok, which was developed by the former Soviet Union in the \n1970s.  It should also be noted that the Skirpal case was not the first time poisoning of former Russian agents on \nBritish soil had ensued.  In 2006, the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned using \nradioactive tea. A British inquiry into the case found that Litvinenko's death was very likely orchestrated by the \nRussian state.\n\nDays after Prime Minister May's deadline elapsed, the British head of government announced the expulsion of 23 \nRussian diplomats from the United Kingdom.  There would also be a cessation of high level bilateral meetings with \nthe Russians, as well as a boycott of the World Cup to be held in Russia later in 2018.  \n\nExplaining her decision before parliament, May said, \"It is not in our national interest to break off all dialogue \nbetween the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. But in the aftermath of this appalling act against our \ncountry, this relationship cannot be the same.\"\n\nThe move was the initial gesture of reprisal by the government of the United Kingdom to the poisoning spy fiasco, \nwhich was quickly being understood as a quasi-act of state-sponsored terrorism. \n\nBut Russia remained undeterred, with the Foreign Ministry issuing a statement that read: \"The British government \nhas opted for confrontation with Russia. To be sure, our response will not be long in coming.\"\n\nNote that Skripal and his daughter remained hospitalized and in critical condition at the time of writing.  Also note \nthat as Prime Minister May was speaking about the Skirpal case,  UK authorities were opening a new  investigation \n-- this time into the mysterious death of Nikolai Glushkov, an associate of the deceased oligarch Boris Berezovsky, \nwho was regarded as quite a rival of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n\nPrimer on presidential election in Russia\n\n(March 18, 2018)\n\nA presidential election was set to be held in Russia on March 18, 2018.  The president in Russia is elected by \npopular vote for a six-year term (eligible for a second term); there is no vice president; if the president dies in office, \ncannot exercise his powers because of ill health, is impeached, or resigns, the premier serves as acting president \nuntil a new presidential election is held, which must be within three months. The premier is appointed by the \npresident with the approval of the Duma.\n\nPresidential elections were last held in March 2012 and won by Vladimir Putin.  It should be noted that Putin served \nas president for two terms from 2000  to 2008.  At the time, presidential terms were four year stints; they have since \nbeen changed to six year terms. In 2008, Putin was succeeded as president by Dmitry Medvedev, but remained in \ngovernment as prime minister.  Medvedev held the office of president from 2008 to 2012 when Putin returned to the \nfore as president following elections and Medvedev, in something of a role reversal, returned to the post of prime \nminister.\n\nNow, in 2018, Putin would be seeking re-election for a second consecutive term in office and a fourth term overall.\n\nA first round of voting would take place on March 18, 2018.  If no one candidate secured an absolute majority of the \nvotes, then a second round would ensue three weeks later, on April 8,  2018.\n\n\n\nPolling data and conventional wisdom indicated that Putin was on track for re-election victory.  His main rivals would \nbe Pavel Grudinin of the Communist Party and Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the Liberal Democratic Party, neither of \nwhich was expected to perform strongly at the polls.\n\nPerhaps the only Russian n politician with the cachet to really challenge Putin was  Alexei Navalny, but he was \nprohibited from  is barred from contesting the presidential election due to a corruption conviction that many view as \npolitically motivated.\n\nOn election day, following the end of voting, the Russian election came to a conclusion with no mystery about who \nwould emerge victorious.\n\nState-controlled exit polls indicated that Putin was on track to capture 76.6 percent of the vote share.  That number \nwas slightly higher than the 70 percent support shown in pre-election polling.\n\nThe landslide level of support for Putin was viewed by some as evidence of his successful bid to leverage \nnationalist sentiment.  Even his move to annex the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, which has been condemned as \nillegal by the international community, was lauded at home as an act of patriotism.  Meanwhile, others have pointed \nto the fact that there was really no fierce competition in the presidential race and many voters saw no point in \nchoosing an alternative.\n\nThe truth, however, was that the political climate was not particularly hospitable to rivals of Putin.  Indeed, the \nmedia itself was under tight Kremlin control.  To that end, critics have noted that Russian media is dominated by \npro-Putinist sentiment, which bolsters Russian support for him and offer rivals little exposure.\n\nRegardless of these structural limits to challenging Putinism in Russia, the outcome of the presidential election in \n2018 was that Vladimir Putin had extended his  grip on power in Russia for another six years.  In a victory speech, \nPutin declared, \"We are a great big team together and I am a member of your team.\"\n\nSpecial Note:\n\nUnited States intelligence agencies concluded in late 2016 that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential \nelection in Republican Donald Trump's favor by damaging the prospects of the Democratic nominee for president, \nHillary Clinton.
