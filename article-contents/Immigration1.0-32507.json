{"title": "Immigration Wars: How to Waste Money and Treat People Cruelly", "body": "\nWe have written a lot on our editorial page about immigration policy - or rather the lack of a coherent, \ncomprehensive immigration policy. Sometimes big national issues can boil down to one person's story.\n\nLawrence Downes, who covers immigration issues for the editorial page, pointed out an article today by Nina \nBernstein about a Mexican immigrant in Brooklyn, a waiter named Angel, whose kidneys are failing. Dialysis keeps \nhim alive. His brother is willing to donate a kidney, but Angel can't get a transplant because he is here illegally.\n\nHospitals won't agree to the transplant because they are not sure they'll get reimbursed. So they want to be paid up \nfront, with money Angel doesn't have. He can't buy private insurance because of his pre-existing condition. And he \ncan't go home to Mexico without risking both his livelihood and his family. His children are American citizens.\n\nInstead Angel gets outpatient dialysis, which costs taxpayers $75,000 a year because it is emergency treatment \nunder Medicaid in New York. A transplant would cost $100,000, end the dialysis and double Angel's life \nexpectancy.\n\nMs. Bernstein talked with Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican Congressman from California who is one of the most \nunreasonable anti-immigrant voices in the House, which is really saying something.\n\nHe had a simple formula for illegal immigrants: \"If they're dead, I don't have an objection to their organs being used. \nIf they're alive, they shouldn't be here no matter what.\"\n\nAnd that highlights one of the many reasons we have no immigration policy: Plain old cold-hearted xenophobia.\n\n\u2022 Opinion Report: Donald Berwick Speaks Out\n\n\u2022 Yes, Racial Profiling Is Illegal\n\n\u2022 Opinion Report: Public Sector Cuts\n\n\u2022 The Immigrant Fitness Test\n\n\u2022 Opinion Report: Alabama's Immigration Law\n"}
