The Continental Meeting of the Indigenous \nPeople is expected to end Saturday with the approval of a common strategy for defending native rights, obtaining \ncompensation for lost lands and commemorating some \"500 years of resistance'' against European domination.The \nmeeting drew Indian delegates _ some dressed in traditional, colorful garb _ from 22 North and South American \ncountries to a tourist area in the town of La Merced, 25 kilometres southeast of the capital Quito. In their opening \nceremony, the Indian leaders declared when Hunan _ an Indian word for an eagle from the north _ joins with Urin _ \nor a condor from the south, a new spirit will emerge and unite the two hemispheres. Cristobal Tapuy, the president \nof the National Confederation of Ecuadoran Indians, denounced police persecution of Indians and the arrest of a \nColombian Indian leader for carrying coca leaves. Coca leaves have been chewed for centuries by Indians in Latin \nAmerica as part of their religious ceremonies and to dull the ache of hunger. Reflecting on the almost 500 years \nsince Spain commissioned Italian explorer Cristopher Colombus to sail westward from Europe in 1492, the Indians \nexpressed dissatisfaction with their situation following the European invasion. Some also criticized U.S. imperialist \npolicies and said there is a need to forge their own independence and self-determination. Also on the agenda for \ndiscussion were education, religion, communication, as well as the role of women in the Indian social structures.\n"}
