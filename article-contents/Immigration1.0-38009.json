Amy Volk that would \nallow asylum seekers to qualify for general assistance benefits for up to 24 months. The bill now heads to the \nDemocratic-controlled House.\n\nRepublican Gov. Paul LePage started a fierce debate over the issue last year when he directed cities and towns to \nstop providing general assistance to certain immigrants, including asylum seekers and those who came to the U.S. \nillegally. A judge recently ruled that LePage's administration doesn't have to reimburse towns for aid provided to \nthose groups.\n"}
