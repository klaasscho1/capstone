{"title": "National Briefing Washington: Off The Citizenship Path", "body": "\nWhite House officials have issued a discussion document on immigration that calls for legislation that would grant \nlegal status to illegal immigrants and guest workers, but would not put them on a path to citizenship. It would allow \nillegal immigrants to remain in the country indefinitely, under certain conditions, and would require guest workers to \nleave the country after six years. The document, drafted after several meetings with Republican senators, was \ndesigned to garner broad Republican support for key immigration principals. Democratic and Republican senators \nare negotiating in hope of coming to a consensus on an immigration bill.   RACHEL L. SWARNS\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
