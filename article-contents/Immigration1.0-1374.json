{"title": "POSSESSION EQUALS DEPORTATION", "body": "\nResident aliens who possess any amount of illegal drugs must be deported and cannot prove the \"good moral \ncharacter\" that might allow them to return, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals rejected an appeal by a Nigerian citizen who arrived on a student visa and faced deportation because of a \nFebruary 1990 conviction for cocaine possession.\nLarry Bazuaye, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has a child who is also a citizen, was convicted of having a \nsmall amount of the drug while he was a student in Los Angeles, said his lawyer, Judith Wood. She said Bazuaye \nwas sentenced to probation, no longer uses drugs and has no subsequent criminal record. The ruling frees the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to follow through on its deportation proceedings against Bazuaye. And \nonce deported, he will never be allowed to re-enter.\n"}
