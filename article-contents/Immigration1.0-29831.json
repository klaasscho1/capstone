{"title": "Et cetera; Smart insights on the news of the day", "body": "\nJeffrey Goldberg and Marc Ambinder, The Atlantic: \"The United States must, for its own security, keep watch over \nPakistan's nuclear program -- and that's more easily done if we remain engaged with the Pakistani government.  \nPakistan, for its part, can afford to lose neither America's direct financial support, nor the help America provides \nwith international lending agencies. Nor can Pakistan's military afford to lose its access to American weapons \nsystems, and to the trainers attached to them.  For all these reasons, Pakistan and America remain locked in a \nhostile embrace.\"\n\nBill Reiter, Fox Sports: \"At the root of the myriad pieces of good news stemming from NBA owners and players \nreaching tentative agreement to start the season on Christmas Day is this simple fact: Those entangled in the long \nlockout realized the NBA is not, in fact, the NFL. Thus, instead of the universal 'Hallelujah!' that greeted football's \nreturn after its own lockout this summer was Saturday's mixture of relief, and the sense it's about darn time.  The \nNBA, a league bursting with possibility, figured out it's not the NFL -- that is has no universal hold on the sports \nscene; that it's not the big dog; that, like any up-and-coming talent, being smart about the future is as important as \nhaving one.\" \n"}
