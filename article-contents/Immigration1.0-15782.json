{"title": "HELP'S IN LINE FOR IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nImmigrants will tell you that dealing with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) - one of three \nformer Immigration and Naturalization Service components that joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \non March 1, 2003 - is even more unpleasant than a visit to the dentist.\n\nIf you walk by its New York offices Monday to Friday, you will see long lines of people waiting to speak to \nimmigration officers about their cases. Rain or shine, freezing weather or unbearable heat, most of them get there \nbefore dawn. And many will be turned away at the end of the day.\n\nYet in these rough times of flash deportations, immigration backlogs, the Patriot Act and undisguised hostility \ntoward immigrants, there is finally a new USCIS program that does something good for them.\n\nIts name is InfoPass, and it is a new system that allows people to set up immigrant appointments online. It holds \nthe almost unbelievable promise of making the seemingly eternal lines disappear - and making life easier for \nimmigrants. It was implemented last year in Florida and in the Los Angeles area on March 17. The results have \nbeen encouraging.\n\n\"This is another important stride in our commitment to bring USCIS customer service into the 21st century,\" an \nobviously proud USCIS Director Eduardo Aguirre said. \"InfoPass debuted last year in Miami, where we faced \nchallenges similar to those in Los Angeles. In a matter of weeks, we saw a dramatic decrease in the lines and wait \ntimes for our clients, and we're optimistic we'll have similar results here.\"\n\nFor immigrants in the New York area, InfoPass would definitely be an improvement.\n\n\"It is a quality-of-life issue for immigrants, and it is important,\" said Allan Wernick, a New York immigration lawyer \nand Daily News columnist. \"And it shows that there is someone in government thinking about what can be done to \nmake things work.\"\n\nNew York is the quintessential immigrant city. However, immigration services here hold the dubious distinction of \nbeing among the country's worst. And even though Aguirre told a group of business people in Miami last month that \nNew York was among the cities where he wants to implement InfoPass, he did not say when. We say the sooner \nthe better.\n\nFor one thing, the new system is pretty easy to use. Customers log on to the InfoPass Web site at uscis.gov. After \ntyping in their zip code, they are directed to the appropriate USCIS office. The Web site then displays a range of \ndates and times for appointments. Once the customer selects an appointment time, the system generates an \nelectronic appointment notice. The customer must print out that notice and bring it with them to their appointment.\n\n\nTo address the legitimate concern that many immigrants do not have access to the Internet, the USCIS has an \nanswer. Those without Internet access can make appointments using touch-screen InfoPass kiosks at any \nparticipating USCIS office. Most public libraries and many community-based organizations, they add, also offer \npublic Internet access.\n\n\"It is a good program,\" Wernick said.\n\nBut InfoPass does not go to the heart of one of the most troubling problems at the USCIS: the long backlog of \napplications for citizenship and permanent residency.\n\nThat backlog has a devastating impact on the lives of immigrants, who are condemned to years of senseless \nseparation from their loved ones, and makes it impossible for them to earn a living by working their fingers to the \nbone - which is what they came to this country for.\n\n\"And [the backlog] deprives immigrants of very fundamental rights, such as voting and fully participating in \nAmerican democracy,\" Wernick said.\n\nObviously, much more than InfoPass is needed. Still, the new system is a positive step that, for a change, does \ngood things for immigrants. Let's hope it comes to New York ASAP.Aruiz@edit.nydailynews.com\n"}
