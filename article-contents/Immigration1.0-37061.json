{"title": "19 ALIENS ARRESTED HERE SENT TO TEXAS", "body": "\nNineteen illegal aliens from Costa Rica and Ecuador were flown Wednesday from St. Louis to Texas for a hearing \nthat an immigration official said probably would lead to their deportation.  Twenty-two people - including one \nwoman, a teen-age boy and a teen-age girl - in two vans were arrested Monday.\nChester Moyer, officer in charge of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in St. Louis, said an investigation \nhad determined that one of the men taken into custody was a U.S. citizen. Another has permanent resident status, \nand a third has temporary resident status, he said. They were released.  Both groups of aliens arrested Monday \ntold immigration officials that they had entered the United States from Mexico. Where and how they crossed the \nborder was unclear. The aliens in one group told officials their journey had begun in Costa Rica; others said \nEcuador.  They told authorities they were traveling to New York and New Jersey, where they planned to find friends \nand relatives and to seek jobs doing janitorial work, Moyer said. Each had paid about $1,000 to ''smugglers'' to \nenter the United States illegally, he said.  The first van, carrying 11 people, was discovered by police about 4 a.m. \nMonday in Sunset Hills, at a service station on Lindbergh Boulevard near Interstate 44. The Highwa y Patrol \nstopped the second van about 8:30 a.m. on I-44, possibly because the van fit a profile of vehicles used by \nsmugglers of illegal drugs and aliens, Moyer said.\n"}
