{"title": "An Advance for American Free Speech", "body": "\nAmid the anti-Communist hysteria of the McCarthy era, Congress passed the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, \ndesigned to exclude foreign visitors whose politics its proponents didn't like. It was an ill-advised law - passed over \nPresident Truman's veto - back in 1952.\nNow, as Communism relaxes its grip on Eastern Europe and perhaps the Soviet Union, it is even more \ninappropriate.\n\nCongress recently moved to dilute the law; by going along, President Bush could emphasize America's \ncommitment to free speech.\n\nThe McCarran-Walter Act lists 33 grounds for excluding foreign visitors. Among them is a broad provision allowing \nthe Government to keep out any alien who might ''engage in activities which would be prejudicial to the public \ninterest, or endanger the welfare, safety or security of the United States.'' The law prevented visits by, among \nothers, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian Nobel laureate.\n\nSince 1988, Congress has imposed a temporary ban on visa denials because of political beliefs. And now, thanks \nto the persistence of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Congress has passed legislation that makes the ban \npermanent. It prohibits the exclusion or deportation of foreign visitors ''because of any past, current or expected \nbeliefs, statements or associations'' that the Constitution protects for American citizens. The Government could still \nbar known or suspected terrorists.\n\nA broader look at McCarran-Walter awaits further Congressional action. Some other grounds for exclusion, like \n''sexual deviation,'' merit re-examination. But the current bill is an important first step. Thirty-eight years ago \nPresident Truman acted sensibly by defying Congress. Mr. Bush now merely has to follow its good example.\n"}
