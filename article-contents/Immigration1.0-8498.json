{"title": "Elian Ruling Prompts Screams, Tears", "body": "\nProtesters outside Elian Gonzalez's former home yelled and cried today but remained peaceful after a court issued \na ruling that could lead to the boy's return to Cuba.\n\nSome in the crowd of about 100 fell to the ground sobbing after the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision \nwas announced in Atlanta. One woman vomited. Another fainted and had to be treated by paramedics.\n\n''The constitution is dead,'' said Roxana Rodriguez, a secretary. ''There is no justice. Democracy and freedom have \nbeen thrown to the trash.''\n\nBut many in the Little Havana crowd called for calm, noting that the decision could be appealed to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n\n''It is not over yet God is with us,'' said Sandra Linar, a 40-year-old homemaker. She held a sign adorned with a \nphoto of Elian and his mother, who died while trying to bring him to the United States, as she consoled other \ndemonstrators.\n\nA small number promised violence if the 6-year-old boy is sent back to the communist nation.\n\n''To hell with being peaceful we have been peaceful long enough,'' said Daniel Jimenez, a 23-year-old unemployed \ndishwasher. But by early afternoon, the crowd had dwindled to only about half what it was at the time of the ruling.\n\nThat was in contrast to April 22, then thousands in Miami's large Cuban-American community took to the streets, \nsome of them burning debris, in the hours after the raid that took the boy away from his Miami relatives. More than \n350 people were arrested.\n\nThe family moved to another home after the raid.\n\nAttorneys for the relatives said today that they have not decided whether they will request a rehearing. Attorney \nKendall Coffey called the decision ''very painful,'' but he said the 11th Circuit judges ''have been very fair.''\n\nMarisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin who acted as his mother during his Miami stay, said that she still has hope \nthat he won't be returned to Cuba, and also hopes to be able to see him.\n\n''I hope the laws of this country favor him and give him the opportunity to seek asylum,'' she said.\n\nElian was rescued by two fishermen off the Florida coast in November. He was found clinging to an inner tube after \nhis mother and 10 others drowned when their boat sank on the way to the United States from Cuba.\n\n\nDonato Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who found Elian and who was photographed holding Elian as he was \nseized by an armed federal agent in April, said today that he was not surprised by the ruling.\n\n''I knew there was no turning back after that raid,'' Dalrymple said. ''I'm sorry he didn't get a true day in court. I'm \nheartbroken. There was no due process.''\n\nDalrymple is suing federal authorities over the raid, and his attorneys filed a motion today seeking to keep the boy \nand his father in the United States until they gave depositions in that suit.\n\n''It's so due process can be taken care of,'' Dalrymple said. ''They're supposed to stay here until the process is over \nwith.''\n\nThe issue of the boy's fate has sparked dozens of rallies in Cuba, many of them led by Castro.\n\nThe aftermath also included a City Hall shake-up in which the police chief resigned and Mayor Joe Carollo fired the \ncity manager.\n\nSister Jeanne O'Laughlin, a nun who was host of a meeting between Elian and his Cuban grandmothers in January \nand then said she thought he should stay in the United States, said that she feels sad for the boy's family.\n\n''It is my sincere hope that this child will continue to experience love from all sides of the family, and that, in time, \nrelationships will be healed,'' she said in a statement.\n\n Protesters outside Elian Gonzalez's former home yelled and cried today but remained peaceful after a court \nissued a ruling that could lead to the boy's return to Cuba.\n\nSome in the crowd of about 100 fell to the ground sobbing after the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision \nwas announced in Atlanta.

He was barred by the appeals court from leaving the country pending a ruling, though his father \nsaid he was willing to wait for the court decision.\n\nThousands in Miami's large Cuban American community reacted angrily to the raid, taking to the streets and \nburning debris More than 350 people were arrested.\n\nElian was rescued off the Florida coast in November.

She also hopes \nthe courts will order Elian's father to allow her and her family to visit the boy.\n\nToday's 33-page unanimous ruling affirms a lower court decision that the INS acted properly in rejecting the \nasylum application, filed on behalf of Elian by his Miami relatives.\n\nThe judges ruled that because no federal law directly applied to the case, the INS was required to come up with a \npolicy dealing with ''the extraordinary circumstances of asylum applications filed on behalf of a 6-year-old child.''\n\nThe judges said it is up to the INS not the courts to determine the best policy.\n\n''The INS did not abuse its discretion or act arbitrarily in applying the policy and rejecting plaintiff's purported asylum \napplication,'' said the ruling, written by Judge J.L. Edmondson.\n\n''The court neither approves nor disapproves the INS' decision to reject the asylum application filed on plaintiffs' \nbehalf, but the INS decision did not contradict (federal law).''\n\nMinutes after the ruling, lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives sought help from Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. \nKennedy, who handles emergency matters from the 11th Circuit for the nation's highest court.\n\nThe request urged Kennedy's help ''to assure that Elian will remain in the United States'' until the full Supreme \nCourt can consider a formal appeal.\n\nhttp://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/\n\n\n''No child, whatever may be his immigration status, deserves fewer judicial rights than hardened criminals.

President \nClinton called it ''a case about the importance of family and the bond between a father and son.''\n\nAfter the decision was announced, anti-Castro protesters in Miami screamed and cried outside the Little Havana \nhome where Elian lived for months with his relatives.\n\n''It is not over yet God is with us,'' said Sandra Linar, a 40-year-old homemaker.

In addition to Elian's mother, 10 other people died after the boat capsized.\n\nElian's Miami relatives cared for him until he was seized April 22 in a government raid and reunited in Washington \nwith his father, who was allowed to leave Cuba while pursuing his attempt to regain custody.\n\nThe boy was crying during the raid and has not seen his Miami relatives since.
