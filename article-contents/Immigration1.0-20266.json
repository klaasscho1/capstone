{"title": "Guest workers or guest soldiers?", "body": "\nTo the editor: Why is President George W. Bush hell-bent to have a Republican Congress enact his version of \namnesty for illegal aliens. Is there some sinister purpose guised beneath the banal pall of \"guest worker program?\"\n\n Ruses to support the proposal are many. One which has been trumpeted repeatedly, like other of the \nadministration's propaganda, is that the guest worker program will legalize those who are doing the work that \nAmerican workers refuse to do. Emphasized too is that America is a nation of immigrants, so why not legalize \n\"undocumented workers?\" It's Christians fulfilling a Christian obligation to help others. But is there an elephant in \nthe \"amnesty discussion room\" in Congress? Is there something obvious, but so controversial that our politicians \nwon't even mention it? Are the media and the American public yet to see Bush's complete amnesty program? \nDespite all attempts to conceal the facts of the matter, Bush's Iraq fiasco is devastating our military and has created \nrecruiting difficulties which have resulted in lower recruiting standards. The American military forces are in dire need \nof a draft, but even the suggestion of a draft at this time would be political suicide. So politicians pretend they don't \nsee the amnesty elephant; the not yet disclosed provision of Bush's amnesty program that will provide a fast track \nto citizenship for illegal immigrants who successfully complete a lengthy military obligation. King George needs \n\"boots on the ground,\" but he can't authorize a draft. So where will he get the troops needed to sustain the military \nand continue his warring ways? Mexico, I'll bet.
