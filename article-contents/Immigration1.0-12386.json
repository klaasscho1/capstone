{"title": "LOCAL INS PAPERS ON HIGH-TECH HOLD", "body": "\nThousands of applications at the Immigration and Naturalization Service office in New York were held up this week \nafter a post-Sept. 11 rule requiring new security checks went into effect.\n\nThe reason: Few INS employees had been trained, and only one computer terminal was compatible with the new \ntechnology at the local office, one of the busiest in the nation, a federal official acknowledged.\n\nIt was unknown yesterday how long an immigrant would have to wait to complete a naturalization process, obtain a \ngreen card or get travel and work authorization documents.\n\n\"This is causing huge nightmares,\" said Marcia Needleman, president of the local chapter of the American \nImmigration Lawyers Association. \"How can they implement a change without the proper resources?\"\n\nImmigrants who showed up for long-awaited appointments were turned away with a form letter signed by New York \nDistrict Director Edward McElroy, explaining the district was unable to complete any applications and petitions \nbecause of procedures \"imposed\" from national headquarters.\n\n\"I'm disappointed,\" said one man, a 42-year-old Korean immigrant from Queens who went to 26 Federal Plaza on \nThursday to get his temporary green card stamped onto his passport.\n\nNext week, a team from Washington is scheduled to arrive in the city to train local employees and set up more \ncomputer terminals to run names on the Interagency Border Inspection System, said national INS spokesman Bill \nStrassberger.\n\n\"They only had one terminal, and we're working to increase that,\" he said. \"The nation's security is our top priority.\"\n\nSecurity database\n\nThe integrated database, which is in use at airports and other border crossings, provides an array of crosschecks of \ninformation from the INS, FBI, Customs Service, Border Patrol and other federal agencies. Before Monday, district \nINS workers ran only an applicant's fingerprints for criminal history, Strassberger said.\n\nMargie McHugh, director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said immigration experts weren't sure how the new \nprocess would improve national security.\n\n\"This is just a knee-jerk reaction from Washington, and it is going to potentially make processing so much slower for \nmillions of applicants around the country without any clear gains for public security,\" she said.\n"}
