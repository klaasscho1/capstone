{"title": "Social Security Offers Amnesty to Immigrants;Those Eligible Under 1986 Law Urged to Stop Using False Numbers", "body": "\nThe Social Security Administration will offer amnesty to illegal immigrants who once used false Social Security \nnumbers or false documents to get a number but now qualify for citizenship under the 1986 immigration law, \nofficials have announced.\n\nAll an immigrant needs to do to qualify for amnesty is to stop using the false Social Security number by Jan. 3, \nagency spokesman Phil Gambino said.\n\n\"That's the first and most important part,\" Gambino said. \"After that, people can come in and correct their records \nand put their earnings on the right number.\"\n\nGambino said people may correct their records any time, as long as they stop misusing false or fraudulently \nobtained Social Security numbers. Such use is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 \nfine. If people do not correct their records, future earnings will not be credited toward higher Social Security \nbenefits.\n\nAn estimated 3.1 million immigrants have applied for citizenship under the amnesty provision of the 1986 \nImmigration Control and Reform Act. They are eligible to get Social Security numbers once they are naturalized.\n\nThe amnesty program of the Social Security Administration is a little-known provision of immigration legislation \npassed in October.\n\nAs many as 2.5 million immigrants may be falsely using Social Security cards and would be eligible for amnesty, \nGambino said.\n"}
