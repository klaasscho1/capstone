{"title": "OVERHAUL OF IMMIGRATION LAW GAINS IN SENATE", "body": "\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a bill to overhaul the nation's immigration law in a major step \ntoward resolving a long-term dispute.\n\nSenator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was the lone dissenter Thursday as the panel voted, 16 \nto 1, to send the proposal to the Senate.\n\nJust minutes before the final vote, Mr. Kennedy won a concession that would greatly increase the number of illegal \naliens now in the country who would be eligible for legal status.\nWASHINGTON, May 28 (AP) - The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a bill to overhaul the nation's \nimmigration law in a major step toward resolving a long-term dispute.\n\nThe Republican-controlled committee, by an 8-to-7 vote, approved Mr. Kennedy's proposal to give temporary legal \nstatus to illegal aliens who could prove they had been here since Jan. 1.\n\nAnother version had set the date at Jan. 1, 1980, the same as in a similar immigration bill pending before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe difference of two years could mean legal status for five million illegal immigrants, or 500,000 more aliens than \nwould otherwise be eligible, according to Reagan Administration and committee figures. It is estimated that there \nare six million illegal aliens in the United States.\n\nTemporary legal status would be the first step for an illegal alien to gain citizenship. However, some illegal aliens \nsay they are fearful of stepping forward and acknowledging their illegal status.\n\nAdministration officials said that if Congress agreed on the 1982 date, President Reagan would probably accept it. \nThe Administration had recommended Jan. 1, 1981, as the cut-off date.\n\nThe bill also proposed permanent legal residence for any immigrant here before Jan. 1, 1978.\n\n \n\nPenalties Against Employers\n\nThe measure would also impose the first civil and criminal penalties against employers who knowingly hired \nimmigrants who lacked legal status.\n\nMr. Kennedy objected to that provision. He said he was worried that employers, out of fear of being fined and \nsentenced to jail, would automatically reject job applications from people of Hispanic descent.\n\n\nMr. Kennedy had unsuccessfully proposed that such sanctions against employers be automatically canceled after \ntwo years unless the President could certify that they were not being used to discriminate against members of \nminority groups.\n\nIn recent years attempts to change the immigration law have stalled in Congress as proposals got caught between \nopposition from many sides. Hispanic groups, among others, favored eased restrictions on immigrants, while \nopponents pushed for stricter measures to guard the nation's borders.\n\nThe committee vote on Thursday suggested that Congress might be ready after years of stalemate to overhaul the \nimmigration laws.  Bipartisan praise was showered on Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, the \nsponsor of the measure, for working out a painstaking compromise. The House version, which is close to the \nSimpson bill but not exactly the same, is sponsored by Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky.\n\nBoth measures contain the proposed sanctions against employers. An employer would be required to check a job \napplicant's eligibility by asking him to show either a birth certificate or passport and a Social Security card or driver's \nlicense.\n\nThe legislation envisions that after three years the Government would develop a means of checking legal status, \nthrough an identification card or through a computerized data bank.\n"}
