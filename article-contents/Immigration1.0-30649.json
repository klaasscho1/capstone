{"title": "Florida: Repatriations to Haiti Resume", "body": "\nImmigration authorities have repatriated 26 Haitians convicted of crimes and one man acquitted of a plot to destroy \nthe Sears Tower in Chicago, the first deportations since the Obama administration halted them after the 2010 \nearthquake in Haiti. Immigrant advocates say political unrest and cholera in Haiti make it inhumane to deport \npeople there. But the United States announced last month that it would resume deporting those convicted of violent \ncrimes who had served their time. Marleine Bastien, executive director of Haitian Women of Miami, called the \ndeportations ''inhumane and very insensitive.'' The man acquitted in the Sears Tower case, Lyglenson Lemorin, \nwas among a group sent back to Haiti on Thursday, his lawyer said. Officials say he remained a security threat.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
