{"title": "ILLEGAL IMMINGRANTS PAYING THEIR DUES", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n The Dec. 3 letter by Roger Conner of the Federation for American Immigration Reform is dead wrong.\n\nCurtailing illegal immigration will not ''keep future budget deficits from growing.''\nRather, it will augment budget deficits and accelerate the depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund since these \nworkers contribute so much to the gross national product and take so little out of the economy.\n\nAccording to a 1979 Labor Department study, undocumented workers spend 60 percent of their wages in the U.S., \nand 75 percent of them pay Social Security and income taxes, even though only 0.5 percent receive welfare and \none percent receive food stamps. Ten percent - and every day more - join America's labor unions, helping to keep \nthem alive.\n\nIf Mr. Conner's assumption that 21 percent take jobs from Americans were true, then why did the Government's \n''Operation Jobs'' fail to deliver more than a handful of jobs to American applicants for vacancies created by the \narrest of 5,635 workers in May 1982 (87 percent of whom were Mexican and most of whom were back at work \nwithin days)?\n\nEliminating illegal immigration will not achieve ''the protection of American workers.'' In fact, implementation of \nlegislation such as the Simpson-Mazzoli bill will mean admitting more Mexican workers than ever before - but under \nregulated conditions that will help preserve slumping American businesses and stimulate the growth of new ones \nwith low-wage, non-organized labor to the detriment of\n\nall\n\n \n\n workers, especially the Spanish-speaking and dark- skinned.\n\n \n\nJAMES D.
