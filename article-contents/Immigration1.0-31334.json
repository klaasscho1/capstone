{"title": "Rewarding scofflaws with tuition", "body": "\nThe March 14 editorial \"Let all Maryland students dream\" failed to note that undocumented immigrants cannot \nlawfully work in Maryland or anywhere else in the United States. So to use millions in tax dollars to provide these \nindividuals tuition benefits not available to lawful U.S. residents (including legal immigrants) who live outside \nMaryland is a waste of limited resources.\n\nIf the rule of law means anything, states will not use tax money to provide aid and comfort to those who reside here \nin knowing violation of the law. And if the goal of Maryland legislators is to help individuals violate federal and state \nlaws regarding illegal immigration, there are cheaper ways to do it.\n\nTom Fitton, Washington\n\nThe writer is president of Judicial Watch.\n"}
