Dan Lungren's announcement contradicted \na legal opinion issued this month by the state Department of Education, which said teachers could face charges \nfor failing to report.\nLungren said at a news conference that his office is preparing guidelines for local law enforcement agencies, \ndistrict attorneys and others who would have new responsibilities under the measure. Enforcement of many of the \ninitiative's provisions would begin immediately, he said. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Unified School District \npromised parents they won't be reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The district fears some \nparents are keeping their children home because of Proposition 187. \"The Los Angeles public schools do not report \n-- we repeat, we do not report -- the identity of any students to the INS or to any other government agency. Federal \nlaw prohibits this,\" read a letter that will be sent to all parents this week.\n\nNotes\n\nCAMPAIGN NEWS IN BRIEF\n"}
