{"title": "INS targets dangerous border crossings", "body": "\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service on Thursday unveiled an array of new measures and high-tech devices \nto heighten security and safety along some of the most porous and dangerous stretches of the U.S.-Mexican \nborder.\n\nThe changes focus on California's Imperial Valley, which has become an increasingly popular but perilous crossing \npoint since a crackdown on illegal immigration closer to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nKey elements of the federal government's new strategy include deployment of hovercraft and horseback units to \npatrol the All American Canal, stepped up helicopter surveillance, extended testing of non-lethal pepper ball \nlaunchers, and installation of six \"rescue beacons\" in the desert outside Yuma, Ariz.\n\nThe beacons are 30-foot-tall towers designed to emit a distress signal and are capped with strobe lights that can be \nspotted five miles away.\n\nA metal plate posted at the base advises migrants in English and Spanish: \"If you need help, push red button. U.S. \nBorder Patrol will arrive in 1 hour. Do not leave this location.\"\n\nMany of the measures will target the Imperial Valley, a region crisscrossed by irrigation waterways including the \nswift-moving All American Canal, where 17 people have drowned since Oct. 1.\n\nThe systems were announced by INS Commissioner James Ziglar during a tour of U.S. Border Patrol operations in \nTucson and Yuma in Arizona, and Calexico and San Ysidro in California.\n\n\"These latest steps represent a major breakthrough in the ongoing effort to make the southern border safer for the \npeople of both nations,\" Ziglar said.\n\nZiglar also announced an unprecedented agreement between the United States and Mexico to establish an \n\"intelligence cell\" in the El Centro area with a mission of helping identify, arrest and prosecute migrant smugglers \non both sides of the border.\n"}
