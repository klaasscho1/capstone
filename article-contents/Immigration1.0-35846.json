{"title": "IMMIGRANTS SPARED THE ISLAND TEST", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n The renovation and restoration of Ellis Island has been mentioned in papers recently, notably in articles and letters \nin The Times. Ellis Island did indeed play a considerable role in the immigration that helped to build our country, but \nI wonder how many of those who want to restore it are aware of the part that class played in Ellis Island \ninterrogation.\n\nOnly steerage passengers went through Ellis Island. While cabins on the liners were occupied mostly by Americans \nand wealthy European tourists, this was not invariably the case. I have an example in my own family.\n\nMy maternal grandfather came to the United States as an immigrant at the turn of the century. He traveled \nsteerage, like most other immigrants, and was interrogated on Ellis Island. He was questioned closely about his \nprospects and qualifications. He was not allowed to have a job, but had to have good qualifications for one.\n\nMy grandmother and the children, who came over several months later, had enough money to obtain second- class \ncabins. They were politely interviewed in the ship's salon and waved ashore without ever seeing Ellis Island.\n\n \n\nARTHUR J. MORGAN New York, June 8, 1984\n"}
