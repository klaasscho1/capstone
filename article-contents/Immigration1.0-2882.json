{"title": "Seize Control of Immigration Policy Now;Asian Conservatives", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nI cannot agree more with Samuel G. Freedman's view in \"Democrats by Default\" (Op-Ed, Oct. 8) that attacks on \nimmigrants hurt the Republicans. Mr. Freedman says Hispanic-American immigrants have exerted a strong socially \nconservative force in America because of their Roman Catholic and evangelical Protestant backgrounds. As an \nimmigrant from China, I wish to add that Asian-Americans also share many conservative values, largely rooted in \nConfucian ideology, which places great importance on the family. The teaching \"the father disciplines, the mother \nnurtures\" designates parental responsibilities.\n\nConfucianism also teaches that public security and order are the basis for a peaceful existence. Traditional Chinese \nlegal codes dictated that those who kill, die. The death penalty is the ultimate deterrent for violent crime.\n\n \n\nVIVIAN YANG\n\nJersey City, Oct. 9, 1996\n"}
