{"title": "DESPERATE FOR ADVICE ON HIS NONCITIZEN WIFE", "body": "\nLIKE MANY callers yesterday to Citizenship Now, the immigration helpline sponsored by the City University of New \nYork and the Daily News, William B. was desperate.\n\nTwo years ago, the American citizen married the love of his life: a Mexican woman who is undocumented.\n\nHe thought that as an American, he would be able to sponsor his wife for a green card. But a law that once allowed \nU.S. citizens to adjust their spouse's status through marriage was done away with in 2001.\n\nNow the mother of William's newborn baby has two options - return to Mexico and face a 10-year ban from the U.S. \nor stay on illegally - said Allan Wernick, a News columnist who directs CUNY's Citizenship and Immigration Project.\n\nWilliam's call to the free helpline - staffed by immigration lawyers, paralegals and counselors - illustrates another \ndaunting problem that many U.S. citizens and their immigrant spouses face.\n\nWhen Congress did away with a law granting residency to a limited number of undocumented immigrants living in \nthe U.S. (provided they paid a $1,000 penalty fee), it left a huge gap for many families seeking legal status, said \nOlivia Cassin, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society.\n\nThe only hope for William's wife is to return to Mexico and request a special waiver on the 10-year bar, Cassin said. \nBut the process is risky and could drag on, she said.\n\nWilliam had scheduled a consultation with a private lawyer for $150 to figure out his options. Now, he said, he's not \ncertain if he needs the consultation.\n\n\"I don't know if my problem will be solved, but this [Citizenship Now] is really a great service,\" said William, who did \nnot wish his full name to be used. lcasimir@nydailynews.com\n"}
