{"title": "Technology Briefing Internet: F.T.C. Inquiry On Fake Driving Permits", "body": "\n     The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that it was seeking to shut six Internet operations that sold \nfraudulent international driving permits, many to immigrants who were looking for legitimate identification \ndocuments. The commission filed complaints in federal courts in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York \nand Washington, D.C. Officials said the operations used unsolicited e-mail messages and Web sites to promote the \npermits. \n\nAn international driving permit translates a government-issued driver's license into different languages; it is not a \nsubstitute for an American license, or any other identification document issued in the United States. J. Howard \nBeales, director of consumer protection at the commission, said the fraudulent permits misled people with limited \nEnglish proficiency. He said the permits were sold on the Internet for as much as $375, while the AAA and the \nAmerican Automobile Touring Alliance charge $10.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
