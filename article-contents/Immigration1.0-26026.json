{"title": "Immigrants are becoming citizens faster than past decades", "body": "\nOrlino and Jonah Ordona of San Jose were concerned about rising immigration fees. Pre-med student Shilpa \nMuddagowni of Cupertino has her eye on a medical residency. Kenneth Leung of Berkeley wants to vote for John \nMcCain in the Feb. 5 primary.\n\nFrom hard-headed pragmatism to the civic idealism of voting, the immigrants who stood in line outside federal \nimmigration offices in San Jose Friday morning had a range of reasons why they were there to become U.S. \ncitizens.\n\n\"My kids are going to be growing up in this land. I don't want to be an observer,\" said Jia-Huey Yuan, 38, of Santa \nClara, moments after she took the oath of citizenship. \"I want to participate and really make an impact, to the \nsociety and to the nation.\"\n\nAccording to a new and unprecedented analysis from the Department of Homeland Security, newer immigrants \nare moving more quickly into citizenship than those who became permanent residents in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nAmong Asian immigrants who got their green cards in the early 1990s, between 53 and 59 percent went on to \nbecome citizens within 10 years, up from about 44 percent among Asians who got green cards in the early 1980s.\n\nAnd while only about 20 percent of Mexican immigrants receiving green cards in the 1990s became citizens \nwithin a decade, Mexican immigrants \"exhibited the greatest relative increase in [naturalization] rates between the \nearliest and latest cohorts,\" said the report, released this week by Homeland Security's Office of Immigration \nStatistics.\n\nBased on federal data between 1973 and 2005, this new, authoritative analysis is based on actual administrative \nrecords instead of polls or other statistical samples.\n\nBecause the study compared the path to citizenship of legal immigrants in different decades, it presents a fresh \nand intriguing view of how legal immigration is evolving.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other signs the movement of immigrants into citizenship appears to be accelerating. In the \nwake of the immigration protests of 2006 and the citizenship drives that followed, the number of citizenship \napplications submitted to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services nearly doubled in the 2007 fiscal year over the \nprevious year, to almost 1.4 million.\n\nThe new study provides \"a much more accurate estimate of citizenship acquisition among immigrants eligible to \napply than almost all prior studies,\" said Irene Bloemraad, a sociologist at the University of California Berkeley and \nthe author of \"Becoming a Citizen - Incorporating Immigrants and Refugees in the United States and Canada.\"\n\n\nAnd in light of the coming elections, \"immigrants might become a greater force in politics in the future,\" Bloemraad \nsaid, \"if the trends continue and citizenship gets translated into voting.\"\n\nStill, Bloemraad and others cautioned, citizenship does not necessarily equal cultural assimilation.\n\n\"High rates of naturalization aren't necessarily a sign that everything is hunky dory,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive \ndirector of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank that wants tighter controls on \nimmigration. \"There are plenty of people who are not assimilated in a deeper sense, not socially or emotionally \nassimilated, but they still become citizens. They don't identify with America as their country and Americans as their \npeople. They have a passport of convenience.\"\n\nKrikorian and other experts agreed that 1996 welfare reform changes that limited social benefits to citizens, \nexcluding legal residents, were a factor in people seeking citizenship in greater numbers. They disagree about the \ninterpretation of that effect.\n\nKrikorian said some people have become citizens since the mid-1990s to claim welfare, food stamps and other \ngovernment benefits. He said CIS research showed that \"the groups with the highest rates of welfare use also had \nthe highest rates of naturalization.\"\n\nOthers argue that relatively few take the oath of citizenship just for a government benefit check.\n\n\"People who get up and move long distances, pay a lot of money to go to a new place, who often risk life and limb \nto get to a country, are generally incredibly motivated people,\" said Tomas Jimenez, a sociologist at the University \nof California, San Diego, and a fellow at the New America Foundation. \"They are not generally the kind of people \nwho are motivated to go to another country to sit on welfare. That's not to say it never happens, but you're getting \nessentially a lot of Type A personalities.\"\n\nBut from welfare and immigration reform acts of the mid-1990s, to travel restrictions and distrust of foreigners after \nthe Sept. 11 attacks, to rising immigration fees and a perception of increasing hostility to immigrants, immigrant \nrights groups agree the distinction between Legal Permanent Resident and citizen has widened.\n\n\"Within the last 10 years, it's become more worthwhile to become a citizen,\" said Jeffrey Passel of the Pew \nHispanic Center, whose research also suggests a surge in citizenship among newer immigrants. \"There are a \nnumber of things that are not available to legal immigrants that used to be, and there are some protections \navailable to citizens that didn't used to be so necessary.\"\n\nFrom eligibility for government jobs to immigration fees, there were plenty of practical reasons immigrants waiting \noutside the US Citizenship and Immigration Services offices on Monterey Road Friday morning gave for their \ndecision to seek citizenship.\n\nYuan, a scientist turned stay-at-home mom, said she had also thought about the many government jobs require \ncitizenship. Like many other soon-to-be-citizens, Yuan said this year's presidential election is a definite factor.\n\nHugo Calderon of San Jose, a native of Mexico who became a citizen Friday, eight years after getting his green \ncard, hasn't chosen who he'll support for president. He just knows he's going to vote.\n\nLigia Henriquez of Santa Clara, a native of Nicaragua who got her green card five years ago, wanted to make sure \nshe became a citizen in time to vote for president. She declined to say who will get her first vote.\n\n\"The right to vote is very important for me,\" said Henriquez. \"How can I explain? You can decide who is better for \nthe country.\"\n\nContact Mike Swift at mswift@mercurynews.com or (408) 271-3648.\n"}
