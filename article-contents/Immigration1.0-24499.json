{"title": "No Benefits for Illegal Immigrants", "body": "\nRuth Marcus's Aug. 8 op-ed column \"Attack Ads You'll Be Seeing\" not only left out important facts, it missed the \npoint. The American people expect Congress to offer solutions to combat illegal immigration, but Democrats are \nmaking the problem worse.\n\nLast week the House Democratic leadership thumbed its collective nose at the will of the American people by \nstealing a vote on a GOP proposal prohibiting taxpayer dollars from going to illegal immigrants. The column \nimplied that our proposal is redundant, but Republicans know that current law is insufficient.\n\nA June 2006 Social Security Administration report revealed that the government is one of the largest employers of \npeople not authorized to work in this country. A June 2003 Agriculture Department report revealed that illegal \nimmigrants were receiving federal housing assistance. Clearly current law is not sufficient.\n\nDemocrats also rolled back GOP reforms requiring states to verify citizenship for those applying for State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program or Medicaid benefits. A 2005 Department of Health and Human Services report found \nthat 46 states allowed self-declaration of citizenship for Medicaid.\n\nAmericans are compassionate people, but they strongly agree with Republicans that illegal immigrants should not \nbe receiving federal benefits.\n\nJOHN BOEHNER\n\nU.S. Representative (R-Ohio)\n\nROY BLUNT\n\nU.S. Representative (R-Mo.)\n\nWashington\n\nThe writers are House Republican leader and House Republican whip, respectively.\n"}
