{"title": "The Day the Immigrants Spoke Up", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n  Re ''Immigrants Take to Street in Show of Strength'' (front page, May 2):\n\nThe demonstrations on Monday were a breathtaking victory not just for immigrants, but for all Latinos. \n\n  The hundreds of thousands of pro-immigration demonstrators indisputably heralded the ethnic group as a political \npowerhouse in America. \n\n  The Latino display of nerve and determination excited the country, causing mixed amounts of cheer and chiding, \ndepending on the viewer's beliefs.\n\n  No one can predict with certainty the consequences of the protests. The one sure-fire conclusion is that Latinos \nwill no longer live in the shadows and sidelines of American society. \n\n  For too long, we have recused ourselves from the national discourse on race relations and equal opportunity. \nLatino leaders and culture used to be peculiar to barrios. Now we have stepped into the spotlight and are not only \nshouting ''Si, se puede!'' (''Yes, I can!'') but more important, ''We are America.'' \n\nWayne Trujillo\n\nLakewood, Colo., May 2, 2006\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nDrawing (Drawing by Rob Shepperson)\n"}
