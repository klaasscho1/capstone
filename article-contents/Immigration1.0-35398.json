Passel, who are demographers for the Census Bureau, \nnoted the bureau's count of illegal aliens must be considered the minimum number residing in the United States.\n\nOfficially, the bureau counted 2,047,000 illegal aliens in 1980.  The researchers also estimated that there were \n5,965,000 aliens legally in the country on census day, April 1, 1980.\n\nFrom there, Mr. Warren and Mr. Passell extrapolated, based on the Census Bureau's experience in miscounting \nother segments of the population. For example, having counted two million illegal aliens means that, if there are \nreally six million illegal aliens in the United States, the bureau must have missed more than 60 percent of them.\n"}
