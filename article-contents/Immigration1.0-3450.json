{"title": "Urban Immigration", "body": "\nThe Post's two-part series on the revival of New York City [front page, May 25 and 26] demonstrates the risk in \nusing a policy of mass immigration to camouflage the ills of urban America.\n\nImmigrants may renew neighborhoods abandoned by \"white flight.\"\nThe unanswered question remains, \"What impelled so many to flee the city in the first place?\" Depending on an \nendless stream of immigrants, many of them illegal, to replace those who have left is hardly enlightened urban \npolicy. As the series documents, many immigrants have no decent place to live, and they are willing to work in \nconditions that are little improvement over the sweatshops of the early 20th century. Is this what we mean by urban \nrevitalization?\n\nThe most disturbing evidence, however, concerns the future. Overcrowding and the language and cultural problems \ncaused by a rapid influx of immigrants have worsened the already-marginal academic performance of New York's \nschools. How, without adequate education, can the children of this generation of immigrants become the heads of \nsolid middle-class households in the future?\n\nNo one questions that immigration brings many benefits to our society. But does our current policy of mass \nimmigration (1.2 million immigrants per year, legal and illegal) augur well for the future of New York or other urban \ncenters?\n\nLAMAR SMITH\n\nU.S. Representative (R-Tex.)\n\nChairman\n\nSubcommittee on Immigration and Claims\n\nWashington\n"}
