{"title": "TEXAS TOWN PASSES ORDINANCE TO CONDUCT ALL CITY MEETINGS IN SPANISH;IT ALSO PROHIBITS CITY WORKERS FROM TURNING IN ILLEGAL ALIENS", "body": "\n \n\nHabla espanol?\n\nIf not, you might walk into an El Cenizo city meeting and wonder what side of the Rio Grande you're on.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the town's commissioners passed an ordinance declaring that all city meetings and functions \nwould be held in Spanish. Ordinances and resolutions still will be written in English, but the city will translate them \ninto Spanish upon request. The commissioners also passed a measure forbidding city employees to turn in \nillegal immigrants.\n\nEl Cenizo is believed to be the only U.S. city with an all-Spanish policy. English translations of meetings are \navailable but must be requested 48 hours in advance.\n\n\"It's not because we don't speak English,\" said City Commissioner Flora Barton. \"It's because we're doing it for \nthose that speak only Spanish, and we want everybody to be comfortable and to understand and to be aware of \nwhat's going on here in El Cenizo.\"\n\nEl Cenizo is a largely blue-collar town of 7,800 about 10 miles outside Laredo. Its main streets are paved, but dirt \nroads also run through the city. Well-kept, modest houses exist side by side with ramshackle homes and buildings. \nFor years, the city had no garbage or ambulance service.\n\nBarton estimates that more than 90 percent of El Cenizo's residents speak Spanish, though many are bilingual. A \nfew people, particularly younger ones, speak only English.\n\nFor several years, meetings have been bilingual, since residents routinely asked commissioners to explain things \nin Spanish, she said. But some Spanish-speakers wouldn't attend city meetings because of the language barrier \nand were surprised by the commissioners' decision.\n\nThe most recent City Council meeting, on Aug. 12, was conducted in Spanish after passage of the measure. \nEnglish First, a Virginia-based org anization working to make English the official language of the country and to \nundo bilingual education, opposed the city's actions.\n\n\"El Cenizo is the canary in the mine,\" English First's executive director, Jim Boulet Jr., said Thursday.\n\n\n\"I think this is a wake-up call to this country, where in a land where 328 different languages are spoken, that we \neither are going to speak in one language in this nation of immigrants or we are going to be speaking in many.\"\n\nIn addition to the language measure, El Cenizo passed a Safe Haven Ordinance, forbidding city employees and \nofficials to ask residents whether they are legal immigrants or citizens or to help an agency like the Border Patrol \nand the Immigration and Naturalization Service find illegal immigrants. City employees who violate the ordinance \ncan be fired.\n\nBarton said the city still would cooperate with the Border Patrol on other matters, such as stopping drug smuggling.\n\nShe said the ordinance was not aimed at making El Cenizo a haven for illegal immigrants. She said residents \nsimply resented constantly having to prove their status to the Border Patrol.\n\nA federal Immigration agency spokesman, Tomas Zuniga, warned: \"If there comes a time when we come into \nconflict with the city ordinances, we would pursue the matter at that time. I don't foresee it going that far, but the \nextreme level would be where we take action through legal means.\"\n\nJessika Silva, director of the El Cenizo Community Center, said the Spanish-language ordinance reflected a \nreality for many people in El Cenizo: \"They have to work hard all day so they don't have time to learn English.\"\n\nBut Virginia Salazar, an El Cenizo resident who teaches nutrition at a community clinic, believes the ordinance is \nwrong-headed.\n\n\"We want our children to get educated,\" she said. \"We want them to have better jobs, to progress. It looks like we're \ngoing backward instead of progressing.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Photo - City Commissioner Flora Barton explains that El Cenizo, Texas, \nwants \"everybody to be comfortable\" when they attend council meetings.
