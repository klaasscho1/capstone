{"title": "Name That Decade (and Try to Smile)", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n Re ''Queasy Feeling About a Decade With No Name,'' by Clyde Haberman (NYC column, Jan. 4):\n\n Has a nameless dread replaced America's famous optimism? For all the talk about two Americas, to an immigrant \n(from Ireland) like me, red and blue America seems enchanted by a shared vision of impending doom. \n\n  For the reds, the catastrophes will be the product of divine providence; different religions offer differing story lines, \nall of them inevitable, none of them pleasant. \n\n For the blues, the catastrophes will be the product of the policies, foreign and domestic, of the reds, whose ascent \nto power carries the aura of predestination. \n\n In times like these, optimism feels insane!\n\n Optimism has never been ''cool'' -- there is something silly, naive, goofy, irrational in the persistence of optimism. \nHope threatens: disillusion is inevitable. Instead of ''Give me your tired,'' should the inscription on the Statue of \nLiberty now read ''Abandon hope all ye who enter here''? \n\n Calm down, America; the sound you hear is the laughter of your immigrants, whose relentless optimism has kept \nyou going for centuries now. Mindful of the danger of self-fulfilling prophecies, perhaps we might recall that we have \nnothing to fear but fear itself. \n\n This decade will be named in retrospect. How it will be named is in our hands, today. \n\nAngela M.
