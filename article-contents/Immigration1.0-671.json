{"title": "Clinton supports immigration limits", "body": "\nPresident Clinton backed a proposal Wednesday to sharply curtail legal immigration, saying the work of the \nnational Commission on Immigration Reform is \"a road map for Congress to consider.\"\n\nAfter a briefing by commission Chairwoman Barbara Jordan, Clinton said in a statement the recommendations \nfrom the panel are consistent with his \"pro-family, pro-work, pro-naturalization\" views.\n\nClinton also told Jordan he approves of the recommendation that closest family members - spouses and minor \nchildren - ought to have priority for admittance, and that American workers ought not be adversely affected by \nimmigration, said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.\n\nThe commission is recommending Congress reduce overall legal immigration by one-third - to 550,000 people per \nyear - by eliminating some categories of immigrants and limiting others.\n\nAdmissions of spouses and minor children of citizens and legal permanent residents would increase, but the door \nwould be shut to siblings of citizens and adult children of citizens and permanent residents.\n\nJordan dismissed an oft-voiced criticism of the plan, saying the commission does not seek to alter the ethnic and \nracial diversity of the immigrant stream. The civil rights leader and ex-congresswoman said the bipartisan panel \nbelieves \"religious and ethnic diversity are compatible with national civic unity.\"\n\n\"To answer some of the critics who are calling for a drastic reduction in admissions: Cultural and religious diversity \nresulting from immigration does not pose a threat to the national interest,\" Jordan said.\n\nNotes\n\nTHE NATION\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO, color, AP; PHOTO, b/w, Wilfredo Lee, AP\n"}
