{"title": "An Emotional Issue for the Top General", "body": "\nGen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified on Monday before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee at a field hearing here on immigrants in the military. \n\n  General Pace paused several times and his voice became emotional as he spoke about his father, an Italian \nimmigrant, who he said often worked three jobs to help his children. He said immigrants had earned 200 awards or \nmedals in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, called the session to counter hearings in which House \nRepublicans challenged a Senate immigration bill as weak on security.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto: Senators John W.
