{"title": "U.S. POPULATION; 300 million's a crowd", "body": "\nThe U.S. population clock will click over to its 300 millionth person at 7:46 a.m. Tuesday, according to the Census \nBureau. It could be a newborn in Atlanta or Detroit, or it could be an immigrant flying in from Venezuela or an illegal \nimmigrant walking in from Mexico. Wherever that person comes from, having 600 million feet tramping about the \ncountry has consequences. Here's a statistical snapshot of the impact we're having.\n\nOn the clock\n\n7 seconds: Time elapsed for every American birth\n\n13 seconds: Time elapsed for every American death\n\n31 seconds: Time elapsed for every international migrant (net)\n\n11 seconds: Time elapsed for the net gain of one person\n\nWhere Americans live\n\n* More than half (51%) the people in America live in just 10 states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, \nNew York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\n* More than half the people in America live within 50 miles of a coast.\n\nSuburbs: 50 percent\n\nCities: 30 percent\n\nRural areas: 20 percent\n\nSource: Center for Environment and Population, 2006 \n\nEnergy\n\n5 percent: U.S. share of world population\n\n25 percent: U.S. consumption of world's oil\n\n\nTop 5 oil consumers (barrels per day), 2002\n\n1.

In 85 percent of these cases, \nthe threat results from habitat loss or alteration.\n\nEndangered by humans\n\nAlaska sea otter\n\nThrived from Alaska to Baja California. Hunted nearly to extinction, otters are thought to number about 6,000.\n\n\n\nLouisiana black bear\n\nMore than 80 percent of this animal's habitat has been lost to development. Illegal kills are also a serious problem.\n\nFlorida panther\n\nOnce roamed the entire Southeast; now, habitat is limited to south Florida; fewer than 100 remain.\n\nShenandoah salamander\n\nVirginia amphibian survives only in Shenandoah National Park.\n\nLoggerhead sea turtle\n\nHuman encroachment on beach nesting sites and commercial fishing threaten these animals.\n\nRight whale\n\nHunted to near extinction, this is the most endanger-ed of all whale species. Only about 600 are believed to remain.\n\nHow Americans roll\n\nThe nation's population hit 200 million in 1967.
