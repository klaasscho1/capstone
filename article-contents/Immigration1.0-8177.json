{"title": "INS shouldn't ignore law to boost census numbers", "body": "\nCENSUS 2000 forms began arriving Monday, the same day the Immigration and Naturalization Service released a \nmemo warning its agents in the field that illegal immigrants are off-limits through August.\n\nTo avoid scaring immigrants away from Census 2000, \"INS enforcement operations that may result in large \nnumbers of arrests, other than standard patrols of the border and public transportation facilities, should not be \nplanned in residential areas during Census 2000 enumeration,\" said the memo.\nJOURNALAgency officials say this includes some work-site enforcement operations that INS routinely conducts to \ndiscourage the hiring of undocumented immigrants.\n\nWithout a doubt, the census needs to be conducted unhindered. Public service announcements and publications \nare everywhere, in numerous languages, urging residents both legal and illegal to stand up and be counted, \nreminding all of the purpose of the census and reassuring them of the confidentiality of responses.\n\nEven if the INS wants to help the Census Bureau achieve its goals, though, is it ever appropriate for a government \nagency to publicize that it will stand by and allow laws to be broken?\n\nSince the agency rarely conducts raids nowadays, and hardly ever in residential areas, this wasn't necessary. \nWe've already criticized the agency for announcing last year that it would scale back workplace raids and instead \ntarget smuggling operations and criminal immigrants. Until immigration law is changed, it is the obligation of the INS \nto enforce the laws at all times and under all circumstances.\n"}
