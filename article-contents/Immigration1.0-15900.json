{"title": "Drivers' Licenses and Terrorism", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n   In ''No Number, No Ride'' (Sept. 12), you report: ''Since January, the Motor Vehicles Department has sent out \nroughly 500,000 letters threatening to suspend the licenses of drivers whose Social Security numbers do not match \nfederal records.'' \n\n  This is the reality of the so-called war on terrorism. In order to create a sense of security, busboys and day \nworkers lose the right to a driver's license and the means to get to their jobs and provide for their families.\n\n  Forget that they pay taxes. Forget that they do the jobs in Westchester that no one else wants to do, and forget \nthat they and their families may have been in this country many years before 9/11. Because instead of an \nintelligence community that can't live up to its description, and pseudo-allies that can't or won't cooperate with the \nanti-terror agenda, the Bush administration has to make a show of somebody. Preferably, somebody who isn't likely \nto visit a polling place in the near future.\n\n   Influential support for the alien community will not be easy to find. Many of the homeowners of Westchester \nCounty look upon the immigrant population as an inexhaustible commodity.\n\n   To the extent that neither Democrats nor Republicans have a solution to the problem of terror or a willingness to \nadmit it, they are the same.\n\nKarl Ackermann\n\nMount Kisco\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
