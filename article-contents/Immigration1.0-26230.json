{"title": "Immigration case nets 1-year term", "body": "\nOne of three brothers charged with bringing in illegal immigrants to staff their roofing business was sentenced \nWednesday to a year in federal prison.\n\nJeronimo Gutierrez was sentenced Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Richard Webber. Jenaro and Juan Gutierrez, \nwho face similar punishment, are scheduled to be sentenced next week.\n\nAll three brothers have pleaded guilty to immigration-related charges that include harboring, transporting or \nemploying illegal aliens.\n\nThe men paid smugglers to bring in six to 24 Mexican workers who were recruited by their mother to work for their \ncompany, Golden Roofing LLC, court documents show.\n\nTwo of the workers told investigators of being brought across the Rio Grande in inflatable boats, driven to Austin, \nTexas, then picked up by the Gutierrez family. Smugglers were paid $4,000 per worker, and the workers then had \nto work off that debt, prosecutors have said.\n\nA fourth brother, Armando, named in court documents, has not been charged. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ware \nwould not comment about that aspect of the case.\n\nJeronimo Gutierrez's attorney, Raymond Bolourtchi, said that his client did not have any supervisory role and never \ntransported any of the workers from the border area. He also said interviews with witnesses did not substantiate \nprosecutors' allegations that the workers had been beaten or kept against their will.\n\nArmando and Jeronimo Gutierrez hail from Berkeley, and Jenaro and Juan lived in Edmundson in St. Louis County, \ndocuments say.\n"}
