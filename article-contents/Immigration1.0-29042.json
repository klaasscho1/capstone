{"title": "WORKMAN MISQUOTES IMMIGRATION REPORT", "body": "\n\"In Florida alone, more than $3.5 billion a year is spent on health care and criminal justice for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nRitch Workman on Sunday, June 6th, 2010 in a 'Florida Today' opinion page article published\n\n* * *\n\nTHE RULING: FALSE\n\nAs Florida lawmakers prepare to introduce their own version of Arizona's strict immigration law, Republican state \nRep. Ritch Workman has been championing the cause by painting the state's illegal immigrant population as the \nscourge of fiscal conservatism, business owners and taxpayers.\n\n\"All businesses and taxpayers face the unfair burden of providing federally mandated services to illegal immigrants, \nand putting the brakes on this noncitizen entitlement program will save Arizona a considerable amount of money,\" \nwrote Workman in a Florida Today opinion page article on June 6, 2010. \"In Florida alone, more than $3.5 billion a \nyear is spent on health care and criminal justice for illegal immigrants. Given this, I think it is time for Florida to \nfollow Arizona\u00d5s lead.\"\n\n$3.5 billion and change is a lot of money in a state that had to close a $6 billion budget gap in 2010, so PolitiFact \nFlorida decided to take this claim on a ride through the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nWorkman's district office directed us to the Florida House Majority Office, which distributes talking points to its \nRepublican members. Staff director Todd Reid told us Workman was slightly off. He gave us a $3.8 billion figure \nculled from a February 2009 report, \"The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Floridians,\" published by the Federation \nfor American Immigration Reform.\n\nThe report, which looks at projected government spending on education, health and incarceration, is one of many \nfiscal analyses distributed by FAIR, an anti-illegal-immigration group based in Washington, D.C.\n\nTo determine Florida's illegal immigration tab, FAIR's special projects director Jack Martin singled out the average \ncost of government services according to, in many instances, other private studies, and then multiplied those \nfigures by the group's estimated immigration population.\n\nTo be sure, pinpointing the size of a demographic that doesn't want to be tracked is not an exact science, but it is \nworth noting that FAIR's conclusions are based on inexact estimates. For example, FAIR ranked Florida's illegal \nimmigration population fourth in the nation, with an estimated 950,000 immigrants in 2008. In contrast, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security ranks Florida third in the nation, with 720,000 illegal immigrants in 2009.\n\nSome of FAIR's other conclusions raise questions.\n\n\nTo start, FAIR's education costs are based on the assumption that nearly every student enrolled in English learning \nclasses is the child of illegal immigrants, since, \"the children of immigrants legally admitted for permanent residence \nare likely to already speak English because the parents lived in the United States as nonimmigrants, prepared for \nyears to immigrate to the United States, or arrived from countries where English is taught in the schools,\" \naccording to the report. That explanation of the students is not a fact, which casts doubts on FAIR's final education \ntally.\n\nHere's another example. FAIR bases its health care costs on a 2002 Florida Hospital Association survey that found \nunreimbursed emergency medical care for illegal immigrants toppled $40 million. But the survey includes responses \nfrom private hospitals that are not funded by the state.\n\nHow about one more? FAIR produces the state's incarceration costs for illegal immigrants based on the state \nDepartment of Corrections' \"illegal alien\" count of inmates. However, no such count exists. Instead, the state keeps \ntabs on all inmates who are not U.S. citizens, whether they're in the country legally or illegally. While many of those \ninmates are eventually released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further immigration \nprocessing, including possible deportation, the state does not track whether its inmates are legal U.S. residents.\n\n\"I would take FAIR's numbers with a big shaker of salt,\" said Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy \nStudies at the Cato Institute, a liberal Washington, D.C., policy group. \"The organization exists to portray \nimmigrants in a bad light.\"\n\nStill, even if FAIR's math passed muster, the report's findings would not validate Workman's claim.\n\nFAIR concludes the bulk of state expenses related to illegal immigrants, or $3.4 billion, is spent on educating the \nchildren of illegal immigrants, including children who were born here and thus are U.S. citizens.\n\nOnly $380 million was spent on uncompensated medical care and incarceration, a far cry from Workman's $3.5 \nbillion-claim, a seemingly impossible figure, acknowledged FAIR.\n\n\"The magnitude of the fiscal cost estimate would require the inclusion of the educational costs,\" said Martin, who \nwrote the FAIR report.\n\nJust to be sure, we checked with state health and criminal justice officials.\n\nThe state budget cites six criminal justice branches: the Department of Corrections, the Justice Administration, the \nDepartment of Juvenile Justice, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of Legal \nAffairs/Attorney General and the Parole Commission. Representatives for each of those departments said they do \nnot track how many illegal immigrants receive services each year. Consequently, any related costs were unknown, \nthey said. The state's health agencies also said they don't count illegal immigrants.\n\nNor do state courts.\n\n\"The Office of the State Courts Administrator tells me that they are not required to keep such data, so they do not,\" \nsaid spokesman Craig Waters.\n\nOr state auditors.\n\n\"We haven't been told to do that,\" said Kathy McGuire, deputy director of the Florida Legislature's Office of Program \nPolicy Analysis and Government Accountability, when asked for state fiscal projections related to illegal \nimmigration. \"I think it is an emerging issue. It hasn't been a concern in past sessions.\"\n\nTime for some math of our own. It seems Workman grossly misquoted numbers pushed by an anti-illegal-\nimmigration group to bolster his argument against illegal immigration. But, the group's conclusions are suspect \nbecause they are based on assumptions and estimates, not facts, which multiple state agencies confirmed. None of \nthis adds up.\n\n\n\nWe rate Workman's claim False.\n\n* * *\n\nAbout this statement:\n\nPublished: Wednesday, June 30th, 2010 at 6:12 p.m.\n\nSubjects: Immigration\n\nSources:\n\nFlorida Today, \"Time for Florida to follow Arizona's lead,\" June 6, 2010.\n\nFederation for American Immigration Reform, \"The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Floridians,\" February 2009.\n\nE-mail interview, Todd Reid, staff director for the Florida House Majority Office, June 30, 2010.\n\nTelephone interview, Jo Ellyn Rackleff, Florida Department of Corrections spokeswoman, June 30, 2010.\n\nE-mail interview, Susan Smith, Florida Department of Health spokeswoman, June 30, 2010.\n\nE-mail interview, Jack Martin, special projects director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, June \n30, 2010.\n\nTelephone interview, Emily Diaz, Rep.
