{"title": "Don't Come to America Looking for a Handout", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"Immigrants' Burden\" (Op-Ed, Oct. 2): George Soros may have had his broken leg set for free in England after \nWorld War II, but had he been treated in the United States -- where he eventually made his millions -- he would \nhave had to borrow money from a friend or perhaps a local Hungarian-American group to pay the bill, or work it off.\n\nThe point that seems to elude him and other liberals is that we cannot have it both ways in this country. We cannot \nbe an entrepreneurial, dynamic nation of risk-takers and at the same time expect our government to pick up the \npieces every time we stumble or fail. There was a time when immigrants came to this country with expectations of \nfreedom and opportunity, and that was all. Now too many come with the promise of a government handout.\n\nNo one denies that immigrants occasionally need a helping hand, but let it come first from friends, family and \nreligious and civic organizations and then, only as a last resort, from the government.\n\nThe first thing an immigrant should read after arriving on these shores is the help-wanted section of the newspaper, \nnot an application for food stamps.\n\n \n\nWILSON GRABILL\n\nPrinceton, N.J., Oct. 2, 1996\n"}
