{"title": "The GOP's immigration incoherence", "body": "\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S incoherence on illegal immigration was on vivid display last week in Tampa, where \ndelegates gathered to draft their party's official platform.\n\nThe platform amounts to a declaration of war on the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. It \nembraces laws like those in Arizona and            Alabama that are intended to make life so miserable for \nundocumented workers that they will \"self-deport,\" in Mitt Romney's memorable phrase, and it slams the Obama \nadministration for trying to block those measures. The Republican Party would punish cities that look the other way \non immigration enforcement and universities that grant in-state tuition rates to undocumented students, in both \ncases by withholding federal funds.\n\nIn addition, the party of free enterprise and small government would force every employer in the country - in many \ncases against its will - to electronically verify the immigration status of job applicants. At a time when illegal border-\ncrossing from Mexico is at a 40-year low, the GOP would complete the 2,000-mile border fence, at a cost of \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOn the other hand, the GOP platform tips its hat to reality by recognizing that the nation needs low-skilled labor and \nthat there is no adequate legal mechanism to supply it. It therefore calls for a guest-worker program.\n\nBut how does it make sense to embrace such a program while pressing to deport 11 million immigrants, most of \nwhom have been in this country for more than a decade and in many cases are integral parts of American \ncommunities and parents of American citizens? The whole thing amounts to both an acknowledgment that the job \nmarket demands low-wage immigrant workers and a rejection of those who came to this country precisely in \nresponse to that demand.\n\nTo grasp the full absurdity of the GOP's position, suppose for a moment that the party actually carried out its threat \nto drive out 11 million illegal immigrants, including 7 million in the job force. Imagine the scope, cost and \nadministrative complexity of the guest-worker program that would then be required to replace them. It's hard to \nconceive of a more wide-ranging expansion of government.\n\n\nThe GOP's contradictions on immigration have been evident for a number of years. In 2000, the party platform \ncalled for expanding the migrant-farm-workers program. In 2004, bowing to President George W. Bush's support for \nlegalizing millions of undocumented immigrants, the party backed a program that would allow migrants to \"come out \nof the shadows and to participate legally in America's economy\" - if only temporarily. Then in 2008, hard-liners \nslammed the door shut again, pushing through an enforcement-only platform.\n\nPerhaps this year's GOP platform should count as a step forward, for recognizing the market demand for low-skilled \nlabor. But by refusing to devise any alternative to deportation for the undocumented immigrants already here, the \nparty remains in thrall to extremists.\n"}
