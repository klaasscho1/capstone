{"title": "Deportations tear some families apart; Woman's fight shows hard route to legal status", "body": "\nFew words are needed when Liliana Ramos  talks by phone with her youngest daughter, age 11, back in Oregon.\n\n\"Mostly we cry,\" she says. \"All the time we cry and say, 'I love you, I miss you.'\"\n\nAfter living for 21 years in the U.S., Ramos, 39,  was deported to Mexico in September, separated from the two \ndaughters and son she has raised as a single mother since her ex-husband left them seven years ago.\n\nShe had lacked legal immigration status since crossing the border into the U.S. as a teenager with her parents, so \nthe threat of arrest and deportation was always there. Even so, Lily, as she is known to friends, had hoped her \nclean record and two decades of work, paying taxes, going to church and providing for her U.S.-born children would \nallow her a path to legal status or at least avoid deportation.\n\nLike hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, her hopes rose with the Obama administration. In July \n2010, President Obama said mass deportation of all illegal immigrants would be \"intolerable\" to most Americans \nbecause so many have established deep family roots, often with children who are citizens. He said they should be \ngiven a route to legal status: \"Our laws should respect families following the rules instead of splitting them apart.\"\n\nIn June 2011, the administration announced a policy of focusing immigration enforcement  on violent criminals and \nthreats to national security rather than families with children, deep ties to their communities and no criminal \nrecords.\n\nSix months after Obama's 2010 speech, federal agents showed up at the Bend, Ore., resort where Ramos worked \nas a housekeeper, handcuffed her and took her to immigration jail. She realized nothing had changed for her.\n\nA few months after her arrest, when Obama formally announced the policy change seemingly tailored to people like \nher, it made no difference.\n\n\"The immigration people told me, 'No, it's not true, it's only politics,'\" she says, tears flowing from her brown eyes \nas she chats in a small caf in the neighborhood where she stays, far from the center of this border town.\n\nThe policy shift\n\nRamos' example points to a growing complaint from immigrant rights activists over treatment of illegal migrants who \nhave lived law-abiding lives for years and have families here with U.S. citizenship.\n\nIt is an issue that former House speaker Newt Gingrich  made a flash point in the campaign for the Republican \npresidential nomination last month. Gingrich said  he favors pathways to legal status for such long-standing \n\n\nresidents. In words that resonate  for Ramos and her children, he said in a debate:  \"I don't see how the party that \nsays it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families which have been \nhere a quarter-century. I'm prepared to take the heat for saying, 'Let's be humane in enforcing the law.'\"\n\nGingrich's remarks touched off a barrage of criticism from others in the Republican Party, which has  taken a hard \nline toward the estimated 11 million  people in this country without legal immigration status.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants say Obama's promise of humane discretion in immigration cases hasn't slowed the \ndeportation of illegal migrants who have not been convicted of crimes. The American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation, in a Nov. 10 report,  said its examination of 252  cases  pointed to an \"overwhelming conclusion\" that \nmost Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field offices haven't changed their practices since the directive.\n\nThe directive outlined June 17 by ICE Director John Morton  set priorities and advised \"prosecutorial discretion\" in \nenforcement decisions. It said \"particular care should be given when dealing with  juveniles, and the immediate \nfamily members of U.S. citizens.\"\n\nThe Homeland Security Department announced last month  that it would begin training immigration officers and \nattorneys in how to apply the priorities, will review new cases under the guidelines and start a pilot program in \nDenver and Baltimore to identify pending low-priority cases to be dropped.\n\nDeportations, mostly to Mexico, reached a record 396,906  in the fiscal  year that ended Sept. 30.  About 1 million \npeople have been deported since Obama took office, federal records show, continuing an aggressive rise in \ndeportations through the past decade.\n\nObama, in a speech at the border town of El Paso in May, acknowledged the  pace of deportations is a concern \nfor many -- particularly Latinos, a voter bloc that supported his election in 2008 and that he is courting for re-election \nin 2012. He said: \"We are focusing our limited resources on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not \nfamilies, not folks who are just looking to scrape together an income.\"\n\n'We see the lack of action'\n\nFrancisco Lopez, executive director of Causa Oregon, a group that advocates for immigrants, says Ramos' case is \nall too familiar.\n\n\"She is a victim of a lack of implementation\" of enforcement priorities, Lopez says. \"We are very frustrated. We see \nthe lack of action and relief process for cases like Liliana's, mothers with children born here. They need some type \nof relief in order not to be separated from their children.''\n\nICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen says the agency was constrained by privacy laws from discussing Ramos' \ncase in detail. However, Christensen suggested that legal proceedings that began  years ago -- triggered by \nRamos' lawful-if-ill-advised request for legal resident status -- put Ramos in a priority category.\n\n\"ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of criminal aliens, recent \nborder crossers and egregious immigration law violators, including immigration fugitives and those who have been \npreviously removed from the United States,\" Christensen says.\n\nCritics of the administration's immigration policy say it is providing back-door amnesty by allowing low-priority cases \nto be set aside, and that the act of being in United States without legal papers should be enough to warrant \ndeportation.\n\n\"The administration  is saying unless you commit this other crime, we're creating administrative amnesty for you,'' \nsays Ira Mehlman, of Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a  group  that seeks a crackdown on \nillegal immigration and limits on legal immigration.\n\nBarbara Ghio,  a Salem, Ore., immigration lawyer who represented Ramos after her arrest, says Ramos' troubles \ncould be traced to an  application for political asylum filed by Ramos and her husband in 2003. Not only was it \n\n\n\nrejected, as nearly all such applications from Mexican nationals are, she says, it brought Ramos to the attention of \nthe agency, which then began deportation proceedings against her.\n\n\"It was basically knocking on the door of immigration\" authorities, Ghio says.\n\nAfter an appeal was rejected, a deportation order was issued in 2005. Ramos says she was not informed of that \norder. She says her ex-husband, who since has returned to Mexico, filed the papers without her consent. That \nasylum application, Ghio says, was based on erroneous street gossip in immigrant communities that suggested \nasylum was a path to legal status. She says any immigration lawyer would have strongly advised against it.\n\n\"The only thing that made her a priority was she was labeled a fugitive, and the only reason she is a fugitive is \nbecause she filed this (asylum request) without an attorney,\" Ghio says.\n\nRamos was released  after her arrest in January and won a few more months to line up care for her  daughters, \nKarleen, 11, a sixth-grader, and Ashley, 16, a high school junior. A son, Brian, 19, is looking for work and hopes to \nenter community college. Two relatives  care for the younger children .\n\nIn September, Ramos bid a teary farewell and drove  across the U.S.-Mexican border at San Ysidro, Calif., to a \ncountry where she had little connection or family. She has been sleeping in a room lent by the friend of a friend and \nlives off her small savings. She has been unable to find a job or get the necessary Mexican documents, including a \nbirth certificate, that she needs to work.\n\nRamos says her children have discussed joining her in Mexico but she is against it. Her kids are U.S. citizens and \ndon't know enough Spanish  to transfer to Mexican schools without repeating several grades, she says. Without a \njob, she has no way to support them.\n\n\"The whole way we live now is different,\" says Brian Tapia, her son. \"My sisters are going through depression.  My \nlittle sister is crying a lot. We're all really sad.  It's really hard, being without her.\"\n\nAside from the human cost, such deportations can cost U.S. taxpayers, Ghio says. Ramos is no longer paying \nU.S. taxes, and without a parent, her minor children could require state assistance in the future.\n\n\"The only parent they had, who was working and making some money, not a lot but some, can't support them now,\" \nshe says.\n\nMehlman, of the FAIR group, says deported parents such as Ramos should take their children with them, even if \nthe children are U.S. citizens. \"If you are removing the parents from the country, and families are being broken up, \nit means the parents made that decision to break up families,'' he says. \"They can take kids with them. They \nshould take their kids with them.''\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who supports immigrants fighting deportation, says deporting mothers such as \nRamos, if they take their children, amounts to \"de facto deportation of U.S. citizens.''\n\nICE says 55% of those deported in fiscal 2011 \"were convicted of felonies or misdemeanors,\" and 90% were in a \npriority category. But Ghio says ICE lumps serious, violent offenders with minor offenses and traffic cases.\n\nGhio says she sees heartbreaking cases regularly. She has one client now, a high school senior brought to this \ncountry when he was 9 months old, who faces deportation to Mexico after receiving a citation for possessing a \nsmall amount of marijuana. He doesn't even speak Spanish, she says. \"Most people are being deported for very, \nvery small crimes, regardless of what people are saying on TV.\"\n\nIn Tijuana, a sprawling city that abuts San Diego and is scarred by drug-cartel violence, it's easy to find other recent \ndeportees. Many  pay 15 pesos a night, or a little more than $1, to sleep on a hard bunk or floor of a flophouse in a \ndecaying neighborhood a block from the border. They arrive by the hundreds every day, some in hopes of regaining \nentry, others trying to get back to homes elsewhere in the country.\n\n\n\n\"It's hard living here,\" says Richard Escobar, 45, formerly of Montebello, Calif., who says he was deported in \nMarch after failing to renew his legal resident papers. He says he arrived in the United States with his parents at \nage 8. \"I don't know if it's being punished by God or not, but it's tough.\"\n\nRamos, driving her SUV and dressed nicely, looks like a middle-class American of Hispanic descent, so much so \nthat  other deportees  can scarcely believe she shares their predicament.\n\nShe attends  church almost every night. She talks at least once a day to her family in Oregon. She is hoping a \nmiracle will allow her to return to the United States and her family, though Ghio says her legal chances are slim, \nand that barring a waiver or change in the law, or marriage to a U.S. citizen, she is subject to a 10-year waiting \nperiod before she can apply for re-entry.\n\n\"My daughter says, 'What happened to us? Why did this happen to us?'\" Ramos says. \"I miss my kids.\" \n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nGRAPHIC, Color, Julie Snider, USA TODAY (Pie chart)\n"}
