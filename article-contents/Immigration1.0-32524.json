Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds; Proposed Rule Federal Register / Vol. 83 , No. 196 / Wednesday, October 10, 2018 / Proposed Rules \n[[Page 51114]] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY \n8 CFR Parts 103, 212, 213, 214, 245 and 248 [CIS No. 2499-10; DHS Docket No. USCIS-2010-0012] RIN 1615-\nAA22 Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds AGENCY: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, DHS. \nACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to prescribe how it determines whether an alien is \ninadmissible to the United States under section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) because he \nor she is likely at any time to become a public charge. \n\nAliens who seek adjustment of status or a visa, or who are applicants for admission, must establish that they are \nnot likely at any time to become a public charge, unless Congress has expressly exempted them from this ground \nof inadmissibility or has otherwise permitted them to seek a waiver of inadmissibility. Moreover, DHS proposes to \nrequire all aliens seeking an extension of stay or change of status to demonstrate that they have not received, are \nnot currently receiving, nor are likely to receive, public benefits as defined in the proposed rule. DHS proposes to \ndefine ``public charge'' as the term is used in sections 212(a)(4) of the Act. DHS also proposes to define the types \nof public benefits that are considered in public charge inadmissibility determinations. DHS would consider an alien's \nreceipt of public benefits when such receipt is above the applicable threshold(s) proposed by DHS, either in terms \nof dollar value or duration of receipt. DHS proposes to clarify that it will make public charge inadmissibility \ndeterminations based on consideration of the factors set forth in section 212(a)(4) and in the totality of an alien's \ncircumstances. DHS also proposes to clarify when an alien seeking adjustment of status, who is inadmissible \nunder section 212(a)(4) of the Act, may be granted adjustment of status in the discretion of DHS upon the giving of \na public charge bond. DHS is also proposing revisions to existing USCIS information collections and new \ninformation collection instruments to accompany the proposed regulatory changes. With the publication of this \nproposed rule, DHS withdraws the proposed regulation on public charge that the former Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) published on May 26, 1999. DATES: Written comments and related material to this \nproposed rule, including the proposed information collections, must be received to the online docket via \nwww.regulations.gov, or to the mail address listed in the ADDRESSES section below, on or before December 10, \n2018.

DHS proposes to amend its \nregulations to interpret the minimum statutory factors for determining whether an alien is inadmissible because he \nor she is likely to become a public charge. This proposed rule would provide a standard for determining whether an \nalien who seeks admission into the United States as a nonimmigrant or as an immigrant, or seeks adjustment of \nstatus, is likely at any time to become a public charge under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). DHS \nalso provides a more comprehensive framework under which USCIS will consider public charge inadmissibility. \nDHS proposes that certain paper-based applications to USCIS would require additional evidence related to public \ncharge considerations. Due to operational limitations, this additional evidence would not generally be required at \nports of entry. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\2\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1601(1), (2)(A). ----------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------      DHS also proposes amending the nonimmigrant extension of \nstay and change of status regulations by exercising its authority to set additional conditions on granting such \nbenefits. Finally, DHS proposes to revise its regulations governing the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity (Secretary) to accept a public charge bond under section 213 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183, for those seeking \nadjustment of status.  A. Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action      DHS proposes to include the following major \nchanges:      Amending 8 CFR 103.6, Surety bonds. The amendments to this section set forth DHS's discretion to \napprove public charge bonds, cancellation, bond schedules, and breach of bond, and move principles governing \npublic charge bonds to 8 CFR 213.1, as proposed to be revised in this NPRM.      Amending 8 CFR 103.7, adding \nfees for new Form I-945, Public Charge Bond, and Form I-356, Request for Cancellation of Public Charge Bond.      \nAdding 8 CFR 212.20, Applicability of public charge inadmissibility. This section identifies the categories of aliens \nthat are subject to the public charge inadmissibility determination.      Adding 212.21, Definitions. This section \nestablishes key regulatory definitions, including public charge, public benefit, likely at any time to become a public \ncharge, and household.      Adding 212.22, Public charge determination. This section clarifies that evaluating the \nlikelihood of becoming a public charge is a prospective determination based on the totality of the circumstances. \nThis section provides details on how the statute's mandatory factors would be considered when making a public \ncharge inadmissibility determination.      Adding 212.23, Exemptions and waivers for the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility. This section provides a list of statutory and regulatory exemptions from and waivers of inadmissibility \nbased on public charge.      Adding 212.24 Valuation of monetizable benefits. This section provides the \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\nmethodology for calculating the annual aggregate amount of the portion attributable to the alien for the monetizable \nbenefits and considered in the public charge inadmissibility determination.      Amending 8 CFR 213.1, Adjustment \nof status of aliens on submission of a public charge bond. The updates to this section change the title of this section \nand add specifics to the public charge bond provision for aliens who are seeking adjustment of status, including the \ndiscretionary availability and the minimum amount for a public charge bond.      Amending 8 CFR 214.1, \nRequirements for admission, extension, and maintenance of status. These amendments provide that, with limited  \n[[Page 51117]]  exceptions, an application for extension of nonimmigrant stay will be denied unless the applicant \ndemonstrates that he or she has not received since obtaining the nonimmigrant status he or she seeks to extend, is \nnot receiving, and is not likely to receive, public benefits as described in 8 CFR 212.21(b). Where section 212(a)(4) \nof the Act does not apply to the nonimmigrant category that the alien seeks to extend, this provision does not apply.      \nAmending 8 CFR 245.4 Documentary requirements. These amendments require applicants for adjustment of status \nto file the new USCIS Form I-944, Declaration of Self-Sufficiency, to facilitate USCIS' public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination.      Amending 8 CFR 248.1, Change of nonimmigrant classification eligibility. This section provides \nthat with limited exceptions, an application to change nonimmigrant status will be denied unless the applicant \ndemonstrates that he or she has not received since obtaining the nonimmigrant status from which the alien seeks \nto change, is not currently receiving, nor is likely to receive public benefits in the future, as described in proposed 8 \nCFR 212.21(b). Where section 212(a)(4) of the Act does not apply to the nonimmigrant category to which the alien \nrequests a change of status this provision does not apply.  B. Costs and Benefits      This proposed rule would \nimpose new costs on the population applying to adjust status using Application to Register Permanent Residence or \nAdjust Status (Form I-485) that are subject to the public charge grounds on inadmissibility. DHS would now require \nany adjustment applicants subject to the public charge inadmissibility ground to submit Form I-944 with their Form I-\n485 to demonstrate they are not likely to become a public charge.     The proposed rule would also impose \nadditional costs for seeking extension of stay or change of status by filing Form I-129 (Petition for a Nonimmigrant \nWorker); Form I-129CW (Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker); or Form I-539 (Application to \nExtend/Change Nonimmigrant Status) as applicable. The associated time burden estimate for completing these \nforms would increase because these applicants would be required to demonstrate that they have not received, are \nnot currently receiving, nor are likely in the future to receive, public benefits as described in proposed 8 CFR \n212.21(b). These applicants may also incur additional costs if DHS determines that they are required to submit \nForm I-944 in support of their applications for extension of stay or change of status. Moreover, the proposed rule \nwould impose new costs associated with the proposed public charge bond process, including new costs for \ncompleting and filing Form I-945 (Public Charge Bond), and Form I-356 (Request for Cancellation of Public Charge \nBond).     DHS estimates that the additional total cost of the proposed rule would range from approximately \n$45,313,422 to $129,596,845 annually for the population applying to adjust status who also would be required to \nfile Form I-944, the population applying for extension of stay or change of status that would experience opportunity \ncosts in time associated with the increased time burden estimates for completing Form I-485, Form I-129, FormI-\n129CW, and FormI-539, and the population requesting or cancelling a public charge bond using Form I-945 and \nForm I-356, respectively.     Over the first 10 years of implementation, DHS estimates the total quantified new direct \ncosts of the proposed rule would range from about $453,134,220 to $1,295,968,450 (undiscounted). DHS estimates \nthat the 10-year discounted total direct costs of this proposed rule would range from about $386,532,679 to \n$1,105,487,375 at a 3 percent discount rate and about $318,262,513 to $910,234,008 at a 7 percent discount rate.     \nThe proposed rule would impose new costs on the population seeking extension of stay or change of status using \nForm I-129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-539. For any of these forms, USCIS officers would then be able to exercise \ndiscretion in determining whether it would be necessary to issue a request for evidence (RFE) requesting the \napplicant to submit Form I-944. DHS conducted a sensitivity analysis estimating the potential cost of filing Form I-\n129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-539 for a range of 10 to 100 percent of filers receiving an RFE requesting they \nsubmit Form I-944. The costs to Form I-129 beneficiaries who may receive an RFE to file Form I-944 range from \n$6,086,318 to $60,863,181 annually and the costs to Form I-129CW beneficiaries who may receive such an RFE \nfrom $114,132 to $1,141,315 annually. The costs to Form I-539 applicants who may receive an RFE to file Form I-\n944 range from $3,164,375 to $31,643,752 annually.     Simultaneously, DHS is proposing to eliminate the use and \nconsideration of the Request for Exemption for Intending Immigrant's Affidavit of Support (Form I-864W), currently \napplicable to certain classes of aliens. In lieu of Form I-864W, the alien would indicate eligibility for the exemption of \nthe affidavit of support requirement on Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.     \nThe proposed rule would potentially impose new costs on individuals or companies (obligors) if an alien has been \n\n\n\nfound to be inadmissible on public charge grounds, but has been given the opportunity to submit a public charge \nbond, for which USCIS intends to use the new Form I- 945. DHS estimates the total cost to file Form I-945 would be \nat minimum about $34,234 annually.\\3\\ The proposed rule would also impose new costs on aliens or obligors who \nwould submit a Form I-356; DHS estimates the total cost to file Form I-356 would be approximately $825 \nannually.\\4\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\3\\ Calculation: $35.66 (cost per obligor to \nfile Form I-945) * 960 (estimated annual population who would file Form I-945) = $34,233.60 = $34,234 (rounded) \nannual total cost to file Form I-945.     \\4\\ Calculation: $33.00 (cost per obligor to file Form I-356) * 25 (estimated \nannual population who would file Form I-356) = $825.00 annual total cost to file Form I-356. -------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------      Moreover, the proposed rule would also result in a reduction in transfer \npayments from the federal government to individuals who may choose to disenroll from or forego enrollment in a \npublic benefits program. Individuals may make such a choice due to concern about the consequences to that \nperson receiving public benefits and being found to be likely to become a public charge for purposes outlined under \nsection 212(a)(4) of the Act, even if such individuals are otherwise eligible to receive benefits. For the proposed \nrule, DHS estimates that the total reduction in transfer payments from the federal and state governments would be \napproximately $2.27 billion annually due to disenrollment or foregone enrollment in public benefits programs by \naliens who may be receiving public benefits. DHS estimates that the 10- year discounted transfer payments of this \nproposed rule would be approximately $19.3 billion at a 3 percent discount rate and about $15.9 billion at a 7 \npercent discount rate. Because state  [[Page 51118]]  participation in these programs may vary depending on the \ntype of benefit provided, DHS was only able to estimate the impact of state transfers. For example, the federal \ngovernment funds all SNAP food expenses, but only 50 percent of allowable administrative costs for regular \noperating expenses.\\5\\ Similarly, Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) in some HHS programs like \nMedicaid can vary from between 50 percent to an enhanced rate of 100 percent in some cases.\\6\\ However, \nassuming that the state share of federal financial participation (FFP) is 50 percent, the 10-year discounted amount \nof state transfer payments of this proposed policy would be approximately $9.65 billion at a 3 percent discount rate \nand about $7.95 billion at a 7 percent discount rate. DHS recognizes that reductions in federal and state transfers \nunder federal benefit programs may have downstream and upstream impacts on state and local economies, large \nand small businesses, and individuals. For example, the rule might result in reduced revenues for healthcare \nproviders participating in Medicaid, pharmacies that provide prescriptions to participants in the Medicare Part D Low \nIncome Subsidy (LIS) program, companies that manufacture medical supplies or pharmaceuticals, grocery retailers \nparticipating in SNAP, agricultural producers who grow foods that are eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits, or \nlandlords participating in federally funded housing programs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---      \\5\\ Per section 16(a) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008.

BILLING CODE 4410-10-P  [[Page 51119]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.000   [[Page 51120]]   \n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.001   [[Page 51121]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.002   \n[[Page 51122]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.003  BILLING CODE 4410-10-C  III. Purpose of the \nProposed Rule  A. Self-Sufficiency      DHS seeks to better ensure that applicants for admission to the United \nStates and applicants for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident who are subject to the public charge \nground of inadmissibility are self-sufficient, i.e., do not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather \nrely on their own capabilities and the resources of their family, sponsor, and private organizations.\\9\\ Under section \n212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), an alien is inadmissible if, at the time of an application for a visa, \nadmission, or adjustment of status, he or she is likely at any time to become a public charge. The statute requires \nDHS to consider the following minimum factors that reflect the likelihood that an alien will become a public charge: \nThe alien's age; health; family status; assets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills. DHS may \nalso consider any affidavit of support submitted by the alien's sponsor and any other factor relevant to the likelihood \nof the alien becoming a public charge. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\9\\ See 8 U.S.C. \n1601(2). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      As noted in precedent administrative \ndecisions, determining the likelihood of an alien becoming a public charge involves ``consideration of all the factors \nbearing on the alien's ability or potential ability to be self-supporting.'' \\10\\ These decisions, in general, conclude \nthat an alien who is incapable of earning a livelihood, who does not have sufficient funds in the United States for \nsupport, and who has no person in the United States willing and able to assure the alien will not need public support \ngenerally is inadmissible as likely to become a public charge.\\11\\ Furthermore, the following congressional policy \nstatements relating to self-sufficiency, immigration, and public benefits inform DHS's proposed administration of  \n[[Page 51123]]  section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). ------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------      \\10\\ Matter of Vindman, 16 I&N Dec. 131, 132 (Reg'l Comm'r 1977).     \\11\\ See, e.g., Matter of Vindman, \n16 I&N Dec. 131 (Reg'l Comm'r 1977); Matter of Harutunian, 14 I&N Dec. 583 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974). --------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------      (1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States \nimmigration law since this country's earliest immigration statutes.     (2) It continues to be the immigration policy \nof the United States that--     (A) Aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their \nneeds, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private \norganizations; and     (B) The availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United \nStates.\\12\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\12\\ Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105, codified in part at.8 U.S.C. 1601. -------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------      Within this administrative and legislative context, DHS's view \nof self-sufficiency is that aliens subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility must rely on their own \ncapabilities and secure financial support, including from family members and sponsors, rather than seek and \nreceive public benefits to meet their needs. Aliens subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility include: \nImmediate relatives of U.S. citizens, fianc[eacute](e)s, family- preference immigrants, most employment-based \nimmigrants, diversity visa immigrants, and certain nonimmigrants. Most employment-based immigrants are coming \nto work for their petitioning employers; DHS believes that by virtue of their employment, such immigrants should \nhave adequate income and resources to support themselves without resorting to seeking public benefits. Similarly, \nDHS believes that, consistent with section 212(a)(4), nonimmigrants should have sufficient financial means or \nemployment, if authorized to work, to support themselves for the duration of their authorized admission and \ntemporary stay. In addition, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, fianc[eacute](e)s, most family- preference \nimmigrants, and some employment-based immigrants require a sponsor and a legally binding affidavit of support \nunder section 213A of the Act showing that the sponsor agrees to provide support to maintain the alien at an annual \nincome that is not less than 125 percent of the FPG.\\13\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\n\n\n\\13\\ See INA section 213A(a), 8 U.S.C. 1183a(a). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nDHS's view of self-sufficiency also informs other aspects of this proposal. DHS proposes that aliens who seek to \nchange their nonimmigrant status or extend their nonimmigrant stay generally should also be required to continue \nto be self-sufficient and not remain in the United States to avail themselves of any public benefits for which they are \neligible, even though the public charge inadmissibility determination does not directly apply to them. Such aliens \nshould have adequate financial resources to maintain the status they seek to extend or to which they seek to \nchange for the duration of their temporary stay, and must be able to support themselves.  B. Public Charge \nInadmissibility Determinations      DHS seeks to interpret the term ``public charge'' for purposes of making public \ncharge inadmissibility determinations. As noted above, Congress codified the minimum mandatory factors that must \nbe considered as part of the public charge inadmissibility determination under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4): Age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education, and skills.\\14\\ In addition to \nthese minimum factors, the statute states that any affidavit of support under section 213A of the Act may also be \nconsidered.\\15\\ In fact, since an affidavit of support is required for family-sponsored immigrant applicants and \ncertain employment-sponsored immigrant applicants, these aliens are inadmissible as likely to become a public \ncharge if they do not submit such a sufficient affidavit of support.\\16\\ --------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------      \\14\\ See INA section 212(a)(4)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii).     \\15\\ See INA section \n212(a)(4)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B)(iii).     \\16\\ See INA section 212(a)(4)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C). --------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------      Although INS \\17\\ issued a proposed rule and Interim Field \nGuidance in 1999, neither the proposed rule nor Interim Field Guidance sufficiently described the mandatory factors \nor explained how to weigh these factors in the public charge inadmissibility determination.\\18\\ The 1999 Interim \nField Guidance allows consideration of the receipt of cash public benefits when determining whether an applicant \nmeets the definition of ``public charge,'' but excluded consideration of non-cash public benefits. In addition, the \n1999 Interim Field Guidance placed its emphasis on primary dependence on cash public benefits. This proposed \nrule would improve upon the 1999 Interim Field Guidance by removing the artificial distinction between cash and \nnon-cash benefits, and aligning public charge policy with the self-sufficiency principles set forth in the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).\\19\\ The proposed rule would provide \nclarification and guidance on the mandatory factors, including how these factors would be evaluated in relation to \nthe new proposed definition of public charge and in making a public charge inadmissibility determination.\\20\\ ---------\n------------------------------------------------------------------      \\17\\ On March 1, 2003, INS functions were transferred from \nthe Department of Justice to DHS. See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, sections 402(3), 441, \n116 Stat. 2135, 2178, 2192.     \\18\\ See Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28676 \n(May 26, 1999); Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689 (May \n26, 1999). Due to a printing error, the Federal Register version of the field guidance appears to be dated ``March \n26, 1999'' even though the guidance was actually signed May 20, 1999, became effective May 21, 1999 and was \npublished in the Federal Register on May 26, 1999, along with the NPRM.     \\19\\ Public Law 104-193, 110 Stat. \n2105.     \\20\\ Moreover, this proposed policy change is consistent with the March 6, 2017 Presidential Memorandum \ndirecting DHS to issue new rules, regulations, and/or guidance to enforce laws relating to such grounds of \ninadmissibility and subsequent compliance.

Background      Three principal issues \\21\\ have framed the development \nof public charge inadmissibility: (1) The factors involved in determining whether or not an alien is likely to become a \npublic charge, (2) the relationship between public charge and receipt of public benefits, and (3) the consideration of \na sponsor's affidavit of support within public charge inadmissibility determinations. --------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------      \\21\\ See, e.g., Report of the Committee of the Judiciary Pursuant to S. Res. 137, S. Rep. \nNo. 81-1515, at 346-50 (1950). Prior to passage of the INA of 1952, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a \nreport assessing issues within the immigration system, including public charge. The committee recommended \nretention of public charge exclusion in the statute but highlighted two main problems related to its implementation: \n(1) How to determine who is likely to become a public charge and (2) how to find a better way of meeting the \npurpose for which affidavits of support were executed on the alien's behalf. The committee noted that there was no \ndefinition of the term ``likely to become a public charge'' and that the meaning of the term had been left to the \n\n\ninterpretation of administrative officials and the courts. Factors such as financial status, business ownership, health, \nand employability were considerations, as were decisions rendered by the courts and in public charge \ndeterminations made by consular and immigration officers. The committee advised against defining public charge \nin the INA. Instead, it recommended that the determination of whether an alien falls into the public charge category \nshould rest within the discretion of consular and immigration officials because the elements constituting public \ncharge are varied. It also recommended the use of a bond or suitable undertaking over the practice of using \naffidavits of support.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page 51124]]  A. Legal Authority      \nDHS's authority for making public charge inadmissibility determinations and related decisions is found in several \nstatutory provisions. Section 102 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135), 6 U.S.C. \n112, and section 103 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA, or the Act), 8 U.S.C. 1103, charge the Secretary \nwith the administration and enforcement of the immigration and naturalization laws of the United States. In addition \nto establishing the Secretary's general authority for the administration and enforcement of immigration laws, \nsection 103 of the Act enumerates various related authorities including the Secretary's authority to establish \nregulations and prescribe such forms of bond as are necessary for carrying out her authority. Section 212 of the \nAct, 8 U.S.C. 1182, establishes classes of aliens that are ineligible for visas, admission, or adjustment of status and \nparagraph (a)(4) of that section establishes the public charge ground of inadmissibility, including the minimum \nfactors the Secretary must consider in making a determination that an alien is likely to become a public charge. \nSection 212(a)(4) of the Act also establishes the affidavit of support requirement as applicable to certain family-\nbased and employment-based immigrants, and exempts certain aliens from both the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility and the affidavit of support requirement. Section 213 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183, provides the \nSecretary with discretion to admit into United States an alien who is determined to be inadmissible as a public \ncharge under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, but is otherwise admissible, upon the giving of a proper and suitable \nbond. That section authorizes the Secretary to establish the amount and conditions of such bond. Section 213A of \nthe Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, sets out requirements for the sponsor's affidavit of support, including reimbursement of \ngovernment expenses where the sponsored alien received means-tested public benefits. Section 214 of the Act, 8 \nU.S.C. 1184, addresses requirements for the admission of nonimmigrants, including authorizing the Secretary to \nprescribe the conditions of such admission through regulations and when necessary establish a bond to ensure that \nthose admitted as nonimmigrants or who change their nonimmigrant status under section 248 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n1258, depart if they violate their nonimmigrant status or after such status expires. Section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n1255, generally establishes eligibility criteria for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. Section 248 of \nthe Act, 8 U.S.C. 1258, authorizes the Secretary to prescribe conditions under which an alien may change his or \nher status from one nonimmigrant classification to another. The Secretary proposes the changes in this rule under \nthese authorities.  B. Immigration to the United States      The INA governs whether an alien may obtain a visa, be \nadmitted to or remain in the United States, or obtain an extension of stay, change of status, or adjustment of \nstatus.\\22\\ The INA establishes separate processes for aliens seeking a visa, admission, change of status, and \nadjustment of status. For example, where an immigrant visa petition is required, USCIS will adjudicate the petition. \nIf USCIS approves the petition, the alien may apply for a visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and \nthereafter seek admission in the appropriate immigrant classification. If the alien is present in the United States, he \nor she may be eligible to apply to USCIS for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident. In the \nnonimmigrant context, the nonimmigrant typically applies directly to the U.S. consulate or embassy abroad for a \nvisa to enter for a limited purpose, such as to visit for business or tourism.\\23\\ Applicants for admission are \ninspected at or, when encountered, between the port of entry. The inspection is conducted by immigration officers \nin a timeframe and setting distinct from the visa adjudication process. If a nonimmigrant alien is present in the \nUnited States, he or she may be eligible to apply to USCIS for an extension of nonimmigrant stay or change of \nnonimmigrant status. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\22\\ See, e.g., INA section \n212(a), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) (listing grounds of inadmissibility).     \\23\\ Certain nonimmigrant classifications are subject \nto petition requirements and require that a petition be filed and approved by USCIS prior to application for a visa. \nSee, e.g., INA section 214(c), 8 U.S.C. 1184(c). In addition, certain aliens are not subject to a visa requirement in \norder to seek admission as a nonimmigrant. See, e.g., INA section 217, 8 U.S.C. 1187. -------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------      DHS has the discretion to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility as designated by \nCongress. Where an alien is seeking an immigration benefit that is subject to a ground of inadmissibility, DHS \ncannot approve the immigration benefit being sought if a waiver of that ground is unavailable under the INA, the \nalien does not meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for the waiver, or the alien does not warrant the \n\n\n\nwaiver in any authorized exercise of discretion.  C. Extension of Stay and Change of Status      Pursuant to section \n214(a)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1184(a)(1), DHS permits certain nonimmigrants to remain in the United States \nbeyond their current period of authorized stay to continue engaging in activities permitted under their current \nnonimmigrant status. The extension of stay regulations require a nonimmigrant applying for an extension of stay to \ndemonstrate that he or she is admissible to the United States.\\24\\ For some extension of stay applications, the \napplicant's financial status is an element of the eligibility determination.\\25\\ DHS has the authority to set conditions \nin determining whether to grant the extension of stay request.\\26\\ The decision to grant an extension of stay \napplication, with certain limited exceptions, is discretionary.\\27\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------      \\24\\ See 8 CFR 214.1(a)(3)(i).     \\25\\ See, e.g., 8 CFR 214.2(f)(1)(i)(B).     \\26\\ See INA section 214(a)(1), 8 \nU.S.C. 1184(a)(1); 8 CFR 214.1(a)(3)(i).     \\27\\ See 8 CFR 214.1(c)(5). ----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------      Under section 248 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1258, DHS may permit an alien to change his or her status \nfrom one nonimmigrant status to another nonimmigrant status, with certain exceptions, as long as the nonimmigrant \nis continuing to maintain his or her current nonimmigrant status and is not inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) \nof the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).\\28\\ An applicant's financial status is currently part of the determination for \nchanges to certain nonimmigrant classifications.\\29\\ Like extensions of stay, change of status adjudications are \ndiscretionary determinations, and DHS has the authority to set conditions that apply for a nonimmigrant to change \nhis or her status.\\30\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\28\\ See INA section 248(a), 8 \nU.S.C. 1258(a); 8 CFR 248.1(a).     \\29\\ See, e.g., Adjudicator's Field Manual Ch. 30.3(c)(2)(C) (applicants to \nchange status to a nonimmigrant student must demonstrate that they have the financial resources to pay for \ncoursework and living expenses in the United States) [hereinafter AFM].     \\30\\ See INA section 248(a), 8 U.S.C. \n1258(a); 8 CFR 248.1(a). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  D. Public Charge Inadmissibility      \nSection 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), provides that an alien applicant for a visa, admission, or \nadjustment of status is inadmissible if he or she is likely at any time to become a public charge. The public charge \nground of inadmissibility, therefore, applies to any alien applying for a visa to come to the United States temporarily \nor permanently, for admission, or for  [[Page 51125]]  adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent \nresident.\\31\\ Section 212(a)(4) of the Act, does not, however, directly apply to applications for extension of stay or \nchange of status because extension of stay and change of status applications are not applications for a visa, \nadmission, or adjustment of status. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\31\\ See INA \nsection 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The INA does \nnot define public charge. It does, however, specify that when determining if an alien is likely at any time to become \na public charge, consular officers and immigration officers must, at a minimum, consider the alien's age; health; \nfamily status; assets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills.\\32\\ --------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------      \\32\\ See INA section 212(a)(4)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). ----------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------      Some immigrant and nonimmigrant categories are exempt from the public \ncharge inadmissibility ground. DHS proposes to list these categories in the regulation. DHS also proposes to list in \nthe regulation the applicants that the law permits to apply for a waiver of the public charge inadmissibility \nground.\\33\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\33\\ See proposed 8 CFR 212.23. -----------\n----------------------------------------------------------------      Additionally, section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), \npermits the consular officer or the immigration officer to consider any affidavit of support submitted under section \n213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, on the applicant's behalf when determining whether the applicant may become a \npublic charge.\\34\\ In fact, with very limited exceptions, aliens seeking family-based immigrant visas and adjustment \nof status, and a limited number of employment-based immigrant visas or adjustment of status, must have a \nsufficient affidavit of support or will be found inadmissible as likely to become a public charge.\\35\\ -----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------      \\34\\ See INA section 212(a)(4)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii). When \nrequired, the applicant must submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864).     \\35\\ See \nINA section 212(a)(4)(C), (D), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C), (D). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nIn general, an alien whom DHS has determined to be inadmissible based on the public charge ground may, if \notherwise admissible, be admitted at the discretion of the Secretary upon giving a suitable and proper bond or \nundertaking approved by the Secretary.\\36\\ The purpose of issuing a public charge bond is to ensure that the alien \nwill not become a public charge in the future.\\37\\ Since the introduction of enforceable affidavits of support in \nsection 213A of the Act, the use of public charge bonds has decreased and USCIS does not currently have a public \ncharge bond process.\\38\\ This rule would outline a process under which USCIS could, in its discretion, offer public \ncharge bonds to applicants for adjustment of status who are inadmissible only on public charge grounds. --------------\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------      \\36\\ See INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183.     \\37\\ See Matter of \nViado, 19 I&N Dec. 252 (BIA 1985).     \\38\\ See AFM Ch. 61.1(b). ------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------  1. Public Laws and Case Law     Since at least 1882, the United States has denied admission to aliens on \npublic charge grounds.\\39\\ The INA of 1952 excluded aliens who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of \napplication for a visa, or in the opinion of the Government at the time of application for admission, are likely at any \ntime to become public charges.\\40\\ The Government has long interpreted the words ``in the opinion of'' as evincing \nthe subjective nature of the determination.\\41\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\39\\ See \nImmigration Act of 1882, ch. 376, sections 1-2, 22 Stat. 214, 214. Section 11 of the Act also provided that an alien \nwho became a public charge within 1 year of arrival in the United States from causes that existed prior to his or her \nlanding, was deemed to be in violation of law, and was to be returned at the expense of the person or persons, \nvessel, transportation, company or corporation who brought the alien into the United States.     \\40\\ See INA of \n1952, ch. 477, section 212(a)(15), 66 Stat. 163, 183.     \\41\\ See Matter of Harutunian, 14 I&N Dec. 583, 588 (Reg'l \nCmm'r 1974) (``[T]he determination of whether an alien falls into that category [as likely to become a public charge] \nrests within the discretion of the consular officers or the Commissioner . . . Congress inserted the words `in the \nopinion of' (the consul or the Attorney General) with the manifest intention of putting borderline adverse \ndeterminations beyond the reach of judicial review.'' (citation omitted)); Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I&N Dec. 409, \n421 (Att'y Gen. 1962) (``[U]nder the statutory language the question for visa purposes seems to depend entirely on \nthe consular officer's subjective opinion.''). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      A series of \nadministrative decisions after passage of the Act clarified that a totality of the circumstances review was the proper \nframework for making public charge determinations and that receipt of welfare would not, alone, lead to a finding of \nlikelihood of becoming a public charge. In Matter of Martinez-Lopez, the Attorney General opined that the statute \n``require[d] more than a showing of a possibility that the alien will require public support. Some specific \ncircumstance, such as mental or physical disability, advanced age, or other fact showing that the burden of \nsupporting the alien is likely to be cast on the public, must be present. A healthy person in the prime of life cannot \nordinarily be considered likely to become a public charge, especially where he has friends or relatives in the United \nStates who have indicated their ability and willingness to come to his assistance in case of emergency.'' \\42\\ In \nMatter of Perez, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) held that ``[t]he determination of whether an alien is likely \nto become a public charge . . . is a prediction based upon the totality of the alien's circumstances at the time he or \nshe applies for an immigrant visa or admission to the United States. The fact that an alien has been on welfare \ndoes not, by itself, establish that he or she is likely to become a public charge.'' \\43\\ As stated in Matter of \nHarutunian,\\44\\ public charge determinations should take into consideration factors such as an alien's age, \nincapability of earning a livelihood, a lack of sufficient funds for self-support, and a lack of persons in this country \nwilling and able to assure that the alien will not need public support. ---------------------------------------------------------------\n------------      \\42\\ 10 I&N Dec. 409, 421-23 (BIA 1962).     \\43\\ 15 I&N Dec. 136, 137 (BIA 1974).     \\44\\ See 14 I&N \nDec. 583, 589 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The totality of \ncircumstances approach to public charge inadmissibility determinations was codified in relation to one specific class \nof aliens in the 1980s. In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), providing \neligibility for lawful status to certain aliens who had resided in the United States continuously prior to January 1, \n1982.\\45\\ No changes were made to the language of the public charge exclusion ground under former section \n212(a)(15) of the Act, but IRCA contained special public charge rules for aliens seeking legalization under 245A of \nthe Act. Although IRCA provided otherwise eligible aliens an exemption or waiver for some grounds of excludability, \nthe aliens generally remained excludable on public charge grounds.\\46\\ Under IRCA, however, if an applicant \ndemonstrated a history of self-support through employment and without receiving public cash assistance, he or she \nwould not be ineligible for adjustment of status on public charge grounds.\\47\\ In addition, aliens who were ``aged, \nblind or disabled'' as defined in section 1614(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, could obtain a waiver from the public \ncharge provision.\\48\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\45\\ See IRCA of 1986, Public \nLaw 99-603, section 201, 100 Stat. 3359, 3394.     \\46\\ See INA section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii)(IV), 8 U.S.C. \n1255(d)(2)(B)(ii)(IV).     \\47\\ See INA section 245A(d)(2)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 1255(d)(2)(B)(iii).     \\48\\ See INA section \n245A(d)(2)(B)(ii); see also 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(1). DHS does not propose to apply this proposed rule to legalization \napplications filed pursuant to section 245A of the INA or otherwise amend the regulations at 8 CFR part 245a. That \nprovision is subject to legal standards and settlement agreements that impact public charge inadmissibility \ndeterminations in this specific context. See, e.g., Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc. v. Meese, vacated sub nom. Reno v. \nCatholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43 (1993); League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. INS, vacated sub nom. Reno \n\n\n\nv. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43 (1993).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page \n51126]]      INS promulgated 8 CFR 245a.3,\\49\\ which established that immigration officers would make public \ncharge determinations by examining the ``totality of the alien's circumstances at the time of his or her application for \nlegalization.'' \\50\\ According to the regulation, the existence or absence of a particular factor could never be the sole \ncriterion for determining whether a person is likely to become a public charge.\\51\\ Further, the regulation \nestablished that the determination is a ``prospective evaluation based on the alien's age, health, income, and \nvocation.'' \\52\\ A special provision in the rule stated that aliens with incomes below the poverty level are not \nexcludable if they are consistently employed and show the ability to support themselves.\\53\\ Finally, an alien's past \nreceipt of public cash assistance would be a significant factor in a context that also considers the alien's consistent \npast employment.\\54\\ In Matter of A- ,\\55\\ INS again pursued a totality of circumstances approach in public charge \ndeterminations. ``Even though the test is prospective,'' INS ``considered evidence of receipt of prior public \nassistance as a factor in making public charge determinations.'' INS also considered an alien's work history, age, \ncapacity to earn a living, health, family situation, affidavits of support, and other relevant factors in their totality.\\56\\ -\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\49\\ See Adjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 54 FR \n29442 (Jul. 12, 1989).     \\50\\ 8 CFR 245a.3(g)(4)(i).     \\51\\ 8 CFR 245a.3(g)(4)(i).     \\52\\ 8 CFR 245a.3(g)(4)(i).     \n\\53\\ 8 CFR 245a.3(g)(4)(iii).     \\54\\ See 8 CFR 245a.3(g)(4)(iii).     \\55\\ 19 I&N Dec. 867 (Comm'r 1988).     \\56\\ See \n19 I&N Dec. 867, 869 (Comm'r 1988). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The \nadministrative practices surrounding public charge inadmissibility determinations began to crystalize into legislative \nchanges in the 1990s. The Immigration Act of 1990 reorganized section 212(a) of the Act and re-designated the \npublic charge provision as section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4).\\57\\ In 1996, PRWORA \\58\\ and the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) \\59\\ altered the legislative landscape \nof public charge considerably.\\60\\ Through PRWORA, which is commonly known as the 1996 welfare reform law, \nCongress declared that aliens generally should not depend on public resources and that these resources should not \nconstitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.\\61\\ Congress also created section 213A of the Act and \nmade a sponsor's affidavit of support for an alien beneficiary legally enforceable.\\62\\ The affidavit of support \nprovides a mechanism for public benefit granting agencies to seek reimbursement in the event a sponsored alien \nreceived means-tested public benefits.\\63\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\57\\ See \nImmigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-649, section 601(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5072.     \\58\\ Public Law 104-193, \n110 Stat. 2105.     \\59\\ Public Law 104-208, div.

Public Benefits Under PRWORA     PRWORA also significantly restricted alien eligibility for many \nFederal, State, and local public benefits.\\64\\ With certain exceptions, Congress defined the term ``Federal public \nbenefit'' broadly as: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\64\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1601-1646. ------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------      (A) Any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or \ncommercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and     \n(B) Any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, \nunemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, \nhousehold, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United \nStates.\\65\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\65\\ See Public Law 104-193, section \n401(c), 110 Stat. 2105, 2262 (1996) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. 1611(c)). Congress provided that such term \nshall not apply--     (A) to any contract, professional license, or commercial license for a nonimmigrant whose visa \nfor entry is related to such employment in the United States, or to a citizen of a freely associated state, if section \n141 of the applicable compact of free association approved in Public Law 99-239 or 99-658 (or a successor \nprovision) is in effect;     (B) with respect to benefits for an alien who as a work authorized nonimmigrant or as an \nalien lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.] \nqualified for such benefits and for whom the United States under reciprocal treaty agreements is required to pay \nbenefits, as determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of State; or     (C) to the \nissuance of a professional license to, or the renewal of a professional license by, a foreign national not physically \n\n\n\npresent in the United States. 8 U.S.C. 1611(c)(2). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  (a) \nQualified Aliens     Generally, under PRWORA, ``qualified aliens'' are eligible for federal means-tested benefits after \n5 years and are not eligible for ``specified federal programs,'' and states are allowed to determine whether the \nqualified alien is eligible for ``designated federal programs.'' \\66\\ The following table provides a list of immigration \ncategories that are qualified aliens under PRWORA.\\67\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\66\\ See Public Law 104-193, tit.

On January 16, 2001, the \nDepartment of Justice published a notice of final order, ``Final Specification of Community Programs Necessary for \nProtection of Life or Safety Under Welfare Reform Legislation,'' \\134\\ which indicated that PRWORA does not \npreclude aliens from receiving police, fire, ambulance, transportation (including paratransit), sanitation, and other \nregular, widely available services programs, services, or assistance. In addition, the notice provided for a three-part \ntest in identifying excluded benefits and services for the protection of life and safety. Specified programs must \nsatisfy all three prongs of this test: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\134\\ See Final \nSpecification of Community Programs Necessary for Protection of Life or Safety Under Welfare Reform Legislation, \n66 FR 3613 (Jan. 16, 2001); see also Specification of Community Programs Necessary for Protection of Life or \nSafety Under Welfare Reform Legislation, 61 FR 45985 (Aug. 30, 1996). --------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------      1. The government-funded programs, services, or assistance specified are those that: Deliver in-\nkind (non-cash) services at the community level, including through public or private non-profit agencies or \norganizations; do not condition the provision, amount, or cost of the assistance on the individual recipient's income \nor resources; and serve purposes of the type described in the list below, for the protection of life or safety.     2. The \ncommunity-based programs, services, or assistance are limited to those that provide in-kind (non-cash) benefits \nand are open to individuals needing or desiring to participate without regard to income or resources. Programs, \nservices, or assistance delivered at the community level, even if they serve purposes of the type described, are not \nwithin this specification if they condition on the individual recipient's income or resources: (a) The provision of \nassistance; (b) the amount of assistance provided; or (c) the cost of the assistance provided on the individual \nrecipient's income or resources.     3. Included within the specified programs, services, or assistance determined to \nbe necessary for the protection of life or safety are the following types of programs:      Crisis counseling and \nintervention programs; services and assistance relating to child protection, adult protective services, violence and \nabuse prevention, victims of domestic violence or other criminal activity; or treatment of mental illness or substance \nabuse;      Short-term shelter or housing assistance for the homeless, for victims of domestic violence, or for \nrunaway, abused, or abandoned children;      Programs, services, or assistance to help individuals during periods of \nheat, cold, or other adverse weather conditions;      Soup kitchens, community food banks, senior nutrition programs \nsuch as meals on wheels, and other such community nutritional services for persons requiring special assistance;      \nMedical and public health services (including treatment and prevention of diseases and injuries) and mental health, \ndisability, or substance abuse assistance necessary to protect life or safety;      Activities designed to protect the life \n\n\nor safety of workers, children and youths, or community residents; and      Any other programs, services, or \nassistance necessary for the protection of life or safety.     In congressional debates leading up to the passage of \nIIRIRA, Senator Kennedy stated that ``[t]hese benefit all, because they relate to the public health and are in the \npublic interest. Where the public interest is not served, we should not provide the public assistance to illegal \nimmigrants.'' \\135\\ Therefore, these benefits were provided to all aliens including illegal aliens. These benefits \nwould not be part of the public charge determination under the proposed rule.\\136\\ -------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------      \\135\\ See 142 Cong.

Changes Under IIRIRA     Under IIRIRA,\\137\\ \nthe public charge inadmissibility statute changed significantly.

Rep.). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS believes that the policy goals \narticulated in PRWORA and IIRIRA should inform its administrative implementation of the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility. There is no tension between the availability of public benefits to some aliens as set forth in \nPRWORA and Congress's intent to deny visa issuance, admission, and adjustment of status to aliens who are likely \nto become a public charge. Indeed, Congress, in enacting PRWORA and IIRIRA very close in time, must have \nrecognized that it made certain public benefits available to some aliens who are also subject to the public charge \ngrounds of inadmissibility, even though receipt of such benefits could render the alien inadmissible as likely to \nbecome a public charge.  [[Page 51133]]      Under the carefully devised scheme envisioned by Congress, aliens \ngenerally would not be issued visas, admitted to the United States, or permitted to adjust status if they are likely to \nbecome public charges. This prohibition may deter aliens from making their way to the United States or remaining \nin the United States permanently for the purpose of availing themselves of public benefits.\\145\\ Congress must \nhave understood, however, that certain aliens who were unlikely to become public charges when seeking a visa, \nadmission, or adjustment of status might thereafter reasonably find themselves in need of public benefits that, if \nobtained, would render them a public charge. Consequently, in PRWORA, Congress made limited allowances for \nthat possibility. But Congress also did not correspondingly limit the applicability of the public charge statute; if an \nalien subsequent to receiving public benefits wished to adjust status in order to remain in the United States \npermanently or left the United States and later wished to return, the public charge inadmissibility consideration \n(naturally including consideration of receipt of public benefits) would again come into play. In other words, although \nan alien may obtain public benefits for which he or she is eligible, the receipt of those benefits may be considered \nfor future public charge inadmissibility determination purposes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------      \\145\\ H.R. Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 144-45 (1996). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n4. INS 1999 Interim Field Guidance     On May 26, 1999, INS issued interim Field Guidance on Deportability and \n\n\nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds.\\146\\ This guidance identified how the agency would determine if a \nperson is likely to become a public charge under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), for admission and \nadjustment of status purposes, and whether a person is deportable as a public charge under section 237(a)(5) of \nthe Act, 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5).\\147\\ INS proposed promulgating these policies as regulations in a proposed rule \nissued on May 26, 1999.\\148\\ DOS also issued a cable to its consular officers at that time implementing similar \nguidance for visa adjudications, and its Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) was similarly updated.\\149\\ USCIS has \ncontinued to follow the 1999 Interim Field Guidance in its adjudications, and DOS has continued following the public \ncharge guidance set forth in the FAM.\\150\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\146\\ See \n64 FR 28689 (May 26, 1999).     \\147\\ See 64 FR 28689 (May 26, 1999).     \\148\\ See Inadmissibility and \nDeportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28676 (May 26, 1999).     \\149\\ See 64 FR 28676, 28680 (May 26, \n1999).     \\150\\ See Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, Public Law 111-3, section \n214, 123 Stat. 8, 56; 9 FAM 302.8-2(B)(2), Determining ``Totality of Circumstances,'' (g) Public Charge Bonds, \navailable at            https://fam.state.gov/fam/09fam/09fam030208.html. -----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------      In the 1999 proposed rule, INS proposed to ``alleviate growing public confusion over the meaning of \nthe currently undefined term `public charge' in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt of Federal, State, \nor local public benefits.'' \\151\\ INS sought to reduce negative public health and nutrition consequences generated \nby the confusion and to provide aliens, their sponsors, health care and immigrant assistance organizations, and the \npublic with better guidance as to the types of public benefits that INS considered relevant to the public charge \ndeterminations.\\152\\ INS also sought to address the public's concerns about immigrants' fears of accepting public \nbenefits for which they remained eligible, specifically in regards to medical care, children's immunizations, basic \nnutrition and treatment of medical conditions that may jeopardize public health. With its guidance, INS aimed to \nstem the fears that were causing noncitizens to refuse limited public benefits, such as transportation vouchers and \nchild care assistance, so that they would be better able to obtain and retain employment and establish self-\nsufficiency.\\153\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\151\\ See 64 FR 28676, 28676 (May \n26, 1999).     \\152\\ See 64 FR 28676, 28676-77 (May 26, 1999).     \\153\\ See 64 FR 28676, 28676-77 (May 26, \n1999). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      INS defined public charge in its proposed rule \nand 1999 Interim Field Guidance to mean ``the likelihood of a foreign national becoming primarily dependent \\154\\ \non the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either: ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------      \\154\\ Former INS defined ``primarily dependent'' as ``the majority'' or ``more than 50 percent.'' -----------------\n----------------------------------------------------------       Receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance; or      \nInstitutionalization for long-term care at government expense.''     When developing the proposed rule, INS \nconsulted with Federal benefit-granting agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), \nthe Social Security Administration (SSA), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Deputy Secretary of HHS, \nwhich administers Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (CHIP), and other benefits, advised that the best evidence of whether an individual is relying primarily on \nthe government for subsistence is either the receipt of public cash benefits for income maintenance purposes or \ninstitutionalization for long-term care at government expense.\\155\\ The Deputy Commissioner for Disability and \nIncome Security Programs at SSA agreed that the receipt of SSI ``could show primary dependence on the \ngovernment for subsistence fitting the INS definition of public charge provided that all of the other factors and \nprerequisites for admission or deportation have been considered or met.'' \\156\\ And the USDA's Under Secretary \nfor Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services advised that ``neither the receipt of food stamps nor nutrition assistance \nprovided under the Special Nutrition Programs administered by [USDA] should be considered in making a public \ncharge determination.'' \\157\\ While these letters supported the approach taken in the 1999 proposed rule and \nInterim Field Guidance, the letters specifically focused on the reasonableness of a given INS interpretation; i.e. \nprimary dependence on the government for subsistence. The letters did not foreclose the agency adopting a \ndifferent definition consistent with statutory authority. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\155\\ See 64 FR 28676, 28686-87 (May 26, 1999).     \\156\\ 64 FR 28676, 28687 (May 26, 1999).     \\157\\ 64 FR \n28676, 28688 (May 26, 1999). The USDA letter did not include supportive reasoning. As noted in greater detail \nelsewhere in this preamble, DHS no longer believes that primary dependence on the government for subsistence is \nthe appropriate standard for public charge determination purposes. In light of the proposed change in the public \ncharge standard and the passage of time, DHS does not believe that the views expressed in those interagency \nconsultations remain fully relevant. DHS has nonetheless considered such views, and has addressed the relevant \nconsiderations--legal authority, predictability, administrability, and adverse impacts-- throughout this proposed rule. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The 1999 proposed rule provided that non-cash, \nsupplemental and certain limited cash, special purpose benefits should not be considered for public charge \npurposes, in light of INS' decision to define public charge by reference to primary dependence on public benefits. \nUltimately, however, INS did not publish a final rule conclusively addressing these issues.  E. Public Charge Bond      \nIf an alien is determined to be inadmissible on public charge grounds under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), he or she may be admitted in the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, if otherwise \nadmissible, upon the giving of a suitable and proper bond.\\158\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------      \\158\\ See INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183; see also 8 CFR 103.6; 8 CFR 213.1.  -----------------------------------\n----------------------------------------  [[Page 51134]]      Historically, bond provisions started with states requiring certain \namounts to assure an alien would not become a public charge.\\159\\ Bond provisions were codified in federal \nimmigration laws in 1903.\\160\\ Notwithstanding codification in 1903, the acceptance of a bond posting in \nconsideration of an alien's admission and to assure that he or she will not become a public charge apparently had \nits origin in federal administrative practice earlier than this date. Beginning in 1893, immigration inspectors served \non Boards of Special Inquiry that reviewed exclusion cases of aliens who were likely to become public charges \nbecause the aliens lacked funds or relatives or friends who could provide support.\\161\\ In these cases, the Board of \nSpecial Inquiry usually admitted the alien if someone could post bond or one of the immigrant aid societies would \naccept responsibility for the alien.\\162\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\159\\ See, e.g., \nMayor, Aldermen & Commonalty of City of N.Y. v. Miln, 36 U.S. 102 (1837) (upholding a New York statute that \nrequired vessel captains to provide certain biographical information about every passenger on the ship and further \npermitting the mayor to require the captain to provide a surety of not more than $300 for each noncitizen passenger \nto indemnify and hold harmless the government from all expenses incurred to financially support the person and the \nperson's children); see also H.D.

In 1970, Congress amended section 213 of \nthe Act to permit the posting of cash received by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and to eliminate specific \nreferences to communicable diseases of public health significance.\\164\\ At that time, Congress also added, without \nfurther explanation or consideration, the phrase that any sums or other security held to secure performance of the \nbond shall be returned ``except to the extent forfeited for violation of the terms thereof'' upon termination of the \nbond.\\165\\ Subsequently, IIRIRA amended the provision yet again when adding a parenthetical which clarified that \na bond is provided in addition to, and not in lieu of, the affidavit of support and the deeming requirements under \nsection 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183A.\\166\\ Regulations implementing the public charge bond were promulgated \nin 1964 and 1966,\\167\\ and are currently found at 8 CFR 103.6 and 8 CFR 213.1. --------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------      \\163\\ See Act of February 20, 1907, ch. 1134, section 26, 34 Stat. 898, 907.     \\164\\ See \nPublic Law 91-313, 84 Stat. 413, 413 (1970); see also 116 Cong.

Discussion of Proposed Rule      This proposed rule would establish a proper nexus between public charge \nand receipt of public benefits by defining the terms public charge and public benefit, among other terms. DHS \nproposes to interpret the minimum statutory factors involved in public charge determinations and to establish a clear \nframework under which DHS would evaluate those factors to determine whether or not an alien is likely at any time \nin the future to become a public charge. DHS also proposes to clarify the role of a sponsor's affidavit of support \nwithin public charge inadmissibility determinations.     In addition, DHS proposes that certain factual circumstances \nwould weigh heavily in favor of determining that an alien is not likely to become a public charge and other factual \n\n\ncircumstances would weigh heavily in favor of determining that an alien is likely to become a public charge.\\168\\ \nThe purpose of assigning greater weight to certain factual circumstances is to provide clarity for the public and \nimmigration officers with respect to how DHS would fulfill its statutory duty to assess public charge admissibility. \nUltimately, each determination would be made in the totality of the circumstances based on consideration of the \nrelevant factors. In addition, DHS proposes that for applications for adjustment of status, the alien would be \nrequired to submit a Form I-944. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\168\\ See proposed 8 \nCFR 212.22. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS also proposes to establish a public \ncharge bond process in the adjustment of status context, and proposes to clarify DHS's authority to set conditions \nfor nonimmigrant extension of stay and change of status applications.     Finally, this proposed rule interprets the \npublic charge inadmissibility ground under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), not the public charge \ndeportability ground under section 237(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5). Department of Justice precedent \ndecisions would continue to govern the standards regarding public charge deportability determinations.  A. \nApplicability, Exemptions, and Waivers      This rule would apply to any alien subject to section 212(a)(4) of the Act, \n8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), who is applying for admission to the United States or is applying for adjustment of status to \nthat of lawful permanent resident before DHS.\\169\\ DOS screens applicants who are subject to public charge \ninadmissibility grounds and who are seeking nonimmigrant or immigrant visas at consular posts worldwide. Nearly \nsixty percent of the 2.7 million immediate relatives, family- sponsored,\\170\\ employment-based, and diversity visa-\nbased immigrants who obtained lawful permanent resident status in the United States between fiscal years 2014 \nand 2016 consular processed immigrant visa applications overseas prior to being admitted to the United States as \nlawful permanent residents at a port-of-entry. Fifty-one percent of immediate relatives, ninety-two percent of family-\nsponsored immigrants, and ninety-eight percent of diversity visa immigrants obtained an immigrant visa at a \nconsular post overseas before securing admission as a lawful permanent resident at a port-of-entry between fiscal \nyears 2014 and 2016.\\171\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\169\\ See proposed 8 CFR \n212.20.     \\170\\ Including first, second, third and fourth preferences of family sponsored immigrants and immediate \nrelatives. See DHS, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2016, Table 6, Persons Obtaining Lawful Permanent \nResident Status by Type and Major Class of Admission: Fiscal Years 2014 to 2016, available at            \n\nin order to seek admission as a nonimmigrant. See, e.g., INA section 217, 8 U.S.C. 1187; see also 8 CFR 212.1. ---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------      Applicants for admission are inspected at, or when \nencountered between, ports of entry. They are inspected by immigration officers to assess, among other things, \nwhether they are inadmissible under section 212(a) of the Act, including section 212(a)(4). Under the proposed rule, \nthe type of nonimmigrant status and the duration of the nonimmigrant's stay in the United States would be \nconsidered in assessing whether the applicant has met his or her burden of demonstrating that he or she is likely to \nbecome a public charge. For example, in determining whether an applicant for admission as a B-2 nonimmigrant \nvisitor for pleasure who is coming to the United States for a one-week vacation is inadmissible on public charge \ngrounds, DHS would consider that this temporary visit is short in nature and that the individual likely would only \nneed financial resources to cover the expenses associated with the vacation.     Similarly, an alien who is the \nbeneficiary of an immigrant visa petition approved by USCIS may apply to a DOS consulate abroad for an \nimmigrant visa to allow him or her to seek admission to the United States as an immigrant.\\174\\ As part of the \nimmigrant visa process, DOS determines whether the applicant is eligible for the visa, which includes a \ndetermination of whether the alien has demonstrated that he or she is admissible to the United States and that no \ninadmissibility grounds in section 212(a) of the Act apply. In determining whether the applicant has demonstrated \nthat he or she is not inadmissible on the public charge ground, DOS reviews all of the mandatory factors, including \nany required affidavits of support submitted under section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a. --------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------      \\174\\ See INA sections 221 and 222, 8 U.S.C. 1201 and 1202; 8 CFR 204; 22 \nCFR part 42. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      This process would not change under the \nproposed rule, but it is likely that DOS will amend its guidance to prevent the issuance of visas to inadmissible \naliens,\\175\\ except as otherwise provided in the Act. DOS would continue to review affidavits of support and screen \naliens for public charge inadmissibility in accordance with applicable regulations and instructions prior to the alien \nundergoing inspection and applying for admission at a pre-inspection location or port-of- entry ----------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------      \\175\\ See INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). -----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------      Additionally, although lawful permanent residents generally are not \nconsidered to be applicants for admission upon their return from a trip abroad, in certain limited circumstances a \nlawful permanent resident will be considered an applicant for admission and, therefore, subject to an inadmissibility \ndetermination.\\176\\ This inadmissibility determination includes whether the alien is inadmissible as likely to become \na public charge, which will be determined upon the lawful permanent resident's return to the United States. -----------\n----------------------------------------------------------------      \\176\\ Lawful permanent residents are regarded as applicants \nfor admission in the following circumstances: (1) Lawful permanent residents who have abandoned or relinquished \nthat status; (2) lawful permanent residents who have been outside the United States for a continuous period in \nexcess of 180 days; (3) lawful permanent residents who have engaged in illegal activity after departing the United \nStates; (4) lawful permanent residents who have departed the United States while under legal process seeking \nremoval of the alien from the United States, including removal proceedings and extradition proceedings; (5) lawful \npermanent residents who have committed an offense identified in section 212(a)(2) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), \nunless granted a waiver of inadmissibility for such offense or cancellation of removal; and (6) lawful permanent \nresidents attempting to enter at a time or place other than as designated by immigration officers or who have not \nbeen admitted to the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer. See INA section \n101(a)(13)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(C). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. Extension of \nStay and Change of Status Applicants     As mentioned above, a nonimmigrant is admitted into the United States to \nstay for the limited period and purpose of the classification under which he or she was admitted and, in most \ninstances, then is expected to depart the United States and return to his or her country. However, consistent with \nthe INA and controlling regulations, DHS may, in its discretion, extend an alien's nonimmigrant status or change an \nalien's nonimmigrant status from one classification to another.\\177\\ Furthermore, DHS is authorized under the INA \nto set conditions on the extension of stay or change of status. Consistent with this authority, DHS is proposing to \nrequire an applicant for an extension of stay or change of status to attest that he or she has neither received since \nobtaining the nonimmigrant status he or she seeks to extend or to which he or she seeks to change, is not \nreceiving, nor is likely to receive at any time in the future one or more public benefits as defined in this proposed \nrule. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\177\\ See INA sections 214(a)(1) and 248(a), 8 \nU.S.C. 1184(a)(1) and 1258(a); see also 8 CFR 214.1, 248.1. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----      Although section 212(a)(4) of the Act by its terms only applies to applicants for visas, admission, and \nadjustment of status, and thus does not, by its terms, render aliens who are likely to become a public charge \n\n\n\nineligible for the extension of stay or change of status, the government's interest in a nonimmigrant alien's ability to \nmaintain self-sufficiency for the duration of the temporary stay does not end with his or her admission as a \nnonimmigrant. In particular, the government has an interest in ensuring that aliens present in the United States do \nnot depend on public benefits to meet their needs.\\178\\ Aliens therefore should remain self-sufficient for the entire \nperiod of their stay, including any extension of stay or additional period of stay afforded by a change of status. \nAccordingly, DHS is proposing to consider whether the alien  [[Page 51136]]  has received since obtaining the \nnonimmigrant status he or she seeks to extend or to which he or she seeks to change, is currently receiving, or is \nlikely to receive public benefits as defined in the proposed rule, when adjudicating an application to extend a \nnonimmigrant stay or change a nonimmigrant status. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\178\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1601(2)(A). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Extension of stay and \nchange of status applicants are already required to provide evidence of maintenance of their current nonimmigrant \nstatus.\\179\\ As part of that determination, for some applicants, DHS considers the alien's financial status \\180\\ and \nbelieves it sound policy to extend that consideration to extensions of stay and change of status generally, rather \nthan to just subsets of nonimmigrants. Although the INA does not indicate that aliens seeking an extension of stay \nor change of status must establish self- sufficiency, consideration of such alien's self-sufficiency aligns with the \naforementioned policy statements set forth in PRWORA.\\181\\ -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----      \\179\\ See INA 214(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1184; 8 CFR 214.1(c)(4); INA 248(a), 8 U.S.C. 1258; 8 CFR 248.1(a).     \n\\180\\ See 8 CFR 214.2(f)(1)(i)(B); AFM Ch. 30.2(c)(2)(F) (``Students seeking reinstatement must submit evidence \nof eligibility, including financial information . . . .''); AFM Ch. 30.3(c)(2)(C) (applicants applying to change status to a \nnonimmigrant student must demonstrate that they have the financial resources to pay for coursework and living \nexpenses in the United States).     \\181\\ 8 U.S.C. 1601. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nExcept where the nonimmigrant status that the alien seeks to extend or to which the alien seeks to change is \nexempted by law from section 212(a)(4) of the Act, in order for an alien to demonstrate that he or she has neither \nreceived since obtaining the nonimmigrant status he or she seeks to extend or from which he or she seeks to \nchange, nor is currently receiving or likely to receive any such public benefits, DHS will require applicants to answer \nquestions on their application form,\\182\\ under penalty of perjury, regarding their receipt of these public benefits. \nThe responses to these questions would be used in determining whether the applicant has met his or her burden to \nestablish eligibility for extension of stay or change of status under the proposed regulation. --------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------      \\182\\ Aliens in nonimmigrant classifications whose employers will be filing Form \nI-129 or Form I-129CW on their behalf will be required to provide this information to their employer. ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------      In adjudicating whether the applicant has demonstrated that he or she \nis not likely to receive public benefits as defined in the proposed rule, at any time in the future, DHS would consider \nthe status to which the alien seeks to extend or to which to change, as well as the anticipated additional period of \nstay. DHS would also consider whether the applicant has provided evidence of maintenance of status and that he \nor she has sufficient financial means to maintain the status he or she seeks, or that he or she will be gainfully \nemployed in such status, as applicable. Based on the information the alien provides in support of the application for \nextension of stay or change of status, USCIS would determine whether the applicant should also submit Form I-944 \nin order to demonstrate that he or she is unlikely to receive public benefits during the temporary stay in the United \nStates.     For example, if the alien is a B-2 nonimmigrant who was admitted to the United States to seek medical \ntreatment and is seeking to extend his or her visit because he or she requires additional medical treatment that was \nunanticipated at the time of admission, the alien would need to submit evidence that he or she has the financial \nmeans to pay for this additional medical treatment and otherwise support himself or herself during the extended \nduration of his or her temporary stay. An alien seeking to extend his or her stay in, or change status to, F-1 or M-1 \nnonimmigrant status would submit evidence of his or her financial ability to pay for his or her study and to financially \nsupport himself or herself.\\183\\ An alien seeking to extend stay in or change to an employment-based \nnonimmigrant status, such as H-2B temporary non-agricultural worker status, would need to submit evidence such \nas tax return transcripts, W-2, or other documentation evidencing income from gainful employment appropriate to \nthe nonimmigrant status being sought.\\184\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\183\\ See \n8 CFR 214.2(f)(1)(i)(B) (students must present ``documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated \non the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID)''); AFM Ch. 30.2(b)(2)(F) (``(F) Students seeking \nreinstatement must submit evidence of eligibility, including financial information and a current I-20.''); AFM Ch. \n30.3(c)(2)(C) (``Aliens seeking F-1 or M-1 status must submit the appropriate Form I-20 and evidence of financial \nability to maintain the new status.

In determining whether the adjustment applicant has \ndemonstrated that he or she is not inadmissible on the public charge ground, DHS proposes to review the \nmandatory statutory factors together with any required affidavit of support and any other relevant information, in the \ntotality of the circumstances. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\185\\ This classification \ncan no longer be sought as of December 20, 2009.

In general, the aforementioned classes of aliens are vulnerable populations of immigrants and \nnonimmigrants. Some have been persecuted or victimized and others have little to no private support network in the \nUnited States. These individuals tend to require government protection and support. Admission of these aliens also \nserves distinct public policy goals separate from the general immigration system. Other legal provisions may \npermit waivers of public charge provisions under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). 5. Waivers     \nThe proposed regulation at 8 CFR 212.23(b) lists the categories of applicants Congress has authorized to apply for \nwaivers of the public charge inadmissibility ground, as follows:      Nonimmigrants who were admitted under section \n101(a)(15)(T) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T) (Victims of Severe Form of Tracking in Persons) at the time of \ntheir adjustment of status under section 245(l)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1255(l)(2)(A);      S (alien witness or \ninformant) nonimmigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(S), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(S);      Applicants for \nadmission and adjustment of status under section 245(j) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1255(j) (alien witness or informant); \nand      Other waivers of the public charge inadmissibility provisions in section 212(a)(4) of the Act permissible \nunder the law.  B. Definitions of Public Charge and Related Terms      DHS proposes to add several definitions that \napply to public charge inadmissibility determinations. 1. Public Charge     The term ``public charge,'' as used in \nsection 212(a)(4) of the Act, is not defined.\\236\\ DHS is proposing to define a public charge as an alien who \nreceives one or more public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b).\\237\\ DHS believes that its proposed definition \n\n\n\nof public charge is consistent with legislative history, case law, and the ordinary meaning of public charge. ------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------      \\236\\ See INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4).     \\237\\ \nSee proposed 8 CFR 212.21(a) and (c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Consistent \nwith the public charge inadmissibility statute \\238\\ and Congressional objectives announced in PRWORA, DHS \nproposes that aliens subject to the public charge inadmissibility ground \\239\\ should ``not depend on public \nresources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their \nsponsors, and private organizations.'' \\240\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\238\\ See \nINA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4) (emphasis added). The alien is inadmissible if he or she ``is likely at any \ntime to become a public charge.''     \\239\\ Aliens subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility are aliens \noutside the United States seeking admission to the country, seeking a visa to permit them to apply for admission \nas a nonimmigrant or immigrant to the United States, or in the United States seeking to adjust status to that of \nlawful permanent residents.     \\240\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1601(2)(A). ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----      There is a scarcity of legislative guidance and case law defining public charge. Legislative history, however, \nsuggests a link between public charge and the receipt of public benefits. According to a 1950 Senate Judiciary \nCommittee report, which preceded the passage of the 1952 Act, a Senate subcommittee highlighted concerns \nraised by an immigration inspector about aliens receiving old age assistance. The Senate subcommittee \nrecommended against establishing a strict definition of the term public charge by law. Because the elements that \ncould constitute any given individual's likelihood of becoming a public charge vary, the subcommittee instead \nrecommended that the determination of whether an alien is likely to become a public charge should rest within the \ndiscretion of consular officers and the Commissioner.\\241\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\241\\ See The 1950 Omnibus Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee, S. Rep. No. 81-1515, at 349 (1950); see \nalso Matter of Harutunian, 14 I&N Dec. 583 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974). ------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------      Before Congress passed IIRIRA in 1996, debates on public charge exclusion and deportation grounds \nconsidered the significance of an alien's use of public benefits and self-sufficiency.\\242\\ One Senator opined that \nimmigrants, upon seeking admission, make a ``promise to the American people that they will not become a burden \non the taxpayers,'' \\243\\ and expressed that it is not ``unreasonable for the taxpayers of this country to require \nrecently arrived immigrants to depend on their sponsors for the first 5 years under all circumstances if the sponsor \nhas the assets.'' \\244\\ Congress through PRWORA \\245\\ further emphasized that ``the availability of public benefits \nnot constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.'' \\246\\ -----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------      \\242\\ See 142 Cong. Rec. S4609 (May 2, 1996) (statement of Sen. Byrd) (``[S]elf-sufficiency will be \nthe watchword for those coming to the United States. By making noncitizens ineligible for Federal means-tested \nprograms, and by `deeming' a sponsor's income attributable to an immigrant, the American taxpayer will no longer \nbe financially responsible for new arrivals.''), available at            https://www.congress.gov/crec/1996/05/02/CREC-\n1996-05-02-pt1-PgS4592.pdf.     \\243\\ 142 Cong. Rec. S4495 (May 1, 1996) (statement of Sen. Simon), available at       \n     https://www.congress.gov/crec/1996/05/01/CREC-1996-05-01-pt1-PgS4457.pdf.     \\244\\ 142 Cong. Rec. S4495 \n(May 1, 1996) (statement of Sen.

For example, in analyzing the term public charge in the context of deportability under \nsection 19 of the  [[Page 51158]]  Immigration Act of 1917,\\247\\ the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia in Ex parte Kichmiriantz explained that public charge should be interpreted as ``a money charge upon, or \nan expense to, the public for support and care.'' \\248\\ The court made clear that the money charge or expense must \nbe upon the public, rather than relatives, but did not specifically identify how much public support renders a person \na public charge. Similarly, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of New York, in Ex parte Mitchell and In re Keshishian respectively, indicated that a public \ncharge is one who is supported at public expense without qualifying or quantifying the level of support at public \nexpense necessary.\\249\\ Furthermore, when the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals considered criminal misconduct and \nimprisonment within the context of public charge in Coykendall v. Skrmetta, the court opined: ``It cannot well be \nsupposed that the words in question were intended to refer to anything other than a condition of dependence on the \npublic for support.'' \\250\\ The Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in Iorio v. Day, likewise stated: ``The language (sic) \nitself, `public charge,' suggests rather dependency than imprisonment.'' \\251\\ Neither circuit court elaborated on the \ndegree of dependence required to sustain a public charge finding. -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n----------      \\247\\ Section 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917 addresses aliens who are deportable within five years \nof entry.     \\248\\ 283 F. 697, 698 (N.D. Cal. 1922).     \\249\\ See Ex parte Mitchell 256 F. 230, 234 (N.D. NY 1919) \nand In re Keshishian 299 F. 804 (S.D. NY 1924).     \\250\\ See Coykendall v. Skrmetta 22 F.2d 121 (5th Cir. 1927).     \n\\251\\ See Iorio v. Day 34 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 1929). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In \nMatter of Martinez-Lopez, the Attorney General indicated that public support or the burden of supporting the alien \nbeing cast on the public was a fundamental consideration in public charge inadmissibility determinations.\\252\\ \nWhile an alien's past receipt of welfare alone does not establish that he or she is likely to become a public charge, \ncase law strongly suggests that an alien's ability or inability to remedy his or her past or current reliance on public \nwelfare for financial support plays a critical role in the outcome of a public charge inadmissibility determination.\\253\\ \nFor example, in Matter of Perez, the BIA acknowledged the respondent's ability to remedy her reliance on welfare in \ndetermining that she may be able to overcome the public charge ground inadmissibility ground in a prospective \napplication for a visa.\\254\\ On the other hand, in Matter of Harutunian and Matter of Vindman, the respondents \nfailed to show a capacity to overcome their dependence on public support.\\255\\ INS expected them to continue \nreceiving public support and determined that they were inadmissible as public charges.\\256\\ ------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------      \\252\\ See Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I&N Dec. 409, 421 (Att'y Gen. 1964)     \n\\253\\ See, e.g., Matter of Vindman, 16 I&N Dec. 131 (Reg'l Comm'r 1977); Matter of Perez, 15 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA \n1974); Matter of Harutunian, 14 I&N Dec. 583 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974).     \\254\\ See Matter of Perez, 15 I&N Dec. at \n137.     \\255\\ See Matter of Harutunian, 14 I&N Dec. at 590 and Matter of Vindman, 16 I&N Dec. at 132.     \\256\\ \nSee id. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Bearing in mind the operative legislative history \nand case law examined above, DHS is proposing a new definition of public charge.\\257\\ The definitions cited in the \n1999 Interim Field Guidance and proposed rule indicates that a person becomes a public charge when he or she is \ncommitted to the care, custody, management, or support of the public, but DHS does not believe that these \ndefinitions suggest or require a primary dependence on the government in order for someone to be a public \ncharge.\\258\\ DHS believes that a person should be considered a public charge based on the receipt of financial \nsupport from the general public through government funding (i.e., public benefits). --------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------      \\257\\ See, e.g., Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.S. 560, 566 (2012) (``When a \nterm goes undefined in statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning.'').     \\258\\ DHS acknowledges the \nimportance of increasing access to health care and helping people to become self-sufficient in certain contexts \n(such as with respect to other agencies' administration of government assistance programs). The INA, however, \ndoes not dictate advancement of those goals in the context of public charge inadmissibility determinations. -----------\n----------------------------------------------------------------      This is consistent with various dictionary definitions of public \ncharge and ``charge'' also support a definition that involves the receipt of public benefits. The current edition of the \nMerriam-Webster Dictionary defines public charge simply as ``one that is supported at public expense.'' \\259\\ \nBlack's Law Dictionary (6th ed.) further defines public charge as ``an indigent; a person whom it is necessary to \nsupport at public expense by reason of poverty alone or illness and poverty.'' \\260\\ In addition, the term ``charge'' is \ndefined in Merriam-Webster Dictionary as ``a person or thing committed into the care of another'' \\261\\ and Black's \nLaw Dictionary defines charge as ``a person or thing entrusted to another's care,'' e.g., ``a charge of the estate.'' \n\\262\\ These definitions generally suggest that an impoverished or ill individual who receives public benefits for a \nsubstantial component of their support and care can be reasonably viewed as being a public charge. The proposed \ndefinition of public charge is also consistent with the concept of an indigent, which is defined as ``one who is needy \nand poor . . . and ordinarily indicates one who is destitute of means of comfortable subsistence so as to be in want.'' \n\\263\\ DHS believes its proposed definition reflects Congress's intent in having aliens be self-sufficient and not \nreliant on the government (i.e., public benefits) for assistance to meet their needs. --------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------      \\259\\ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, Definition of Public Charge,            \n\nexceeds 15 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) for a household of one within a period of 12 \nconsecutive months based on the per-month FPG for the months during which the benefits are received (hereafter \nreferred to as the 15 percent of FPG or the proposed 15 percent standard or threshold); or (2) for benefits that \ncannot be monetized, the benefits are received for more than 12 months in the aggregate within a 36-month period. \nThe proposed definition also addresses circumstances where an alien receives a combination of monetizable \nbenefits equal to or below the 15 percent threshold together with one or more benefits that cannot be monetized. In \nsuch cases, DHS proposes that the threshold for duration of receipt of the non-monetizable benefits would be 9 \nmonths in the aggregate within a 36-month period.\\265\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\264\\ See proposed 8 CFR 212.21(b).     \\265\\ See proposed 8 CFR 212.21(c). ------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------      As proposed in this rule, DHS would consider the following public benefits:  [[Page 51159]]       \nMonetizable benefits:     [cir] Any Federal, State, local, or tribal cash assistance \\266\\ for income maintenance, \nincluding: Supplemental Security Income (SSI),\\267\\ Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),\\268\\ and \nFederal, State or local cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called ``General Assistance'' in the \nState context, but which may exist under other names); ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\266\\ Cash assistance would include any government assistance in the form of cash, checks or other forms of \nmoney transfers, or instruments.     \\267\\ See 42 U.S.C. 1381-1383f     \\268\\ See 42 U.S.C. 601-619. -------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------      [cir] Benefits that can be monetized in accordance with proposed 8 \nCFR 212.24:      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or formerly called ``Food Stamps''), 7 U.S.C. \n2011 to 2036c;      Public housing defined as Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program; \\269\\ -------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------      \\269\\ See 24 CFR part 984; 42 U.S.C. 1437f and 1437u. -----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------       Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate \nRehabilitation); \\270\\ and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\270\\ See 24 CFR parts 5, \n402, 880-884 and 886. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Non-cash benefits that cannot \nbe monetized:     [cir] Benefits paid for by Medicaid, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., except for emergency medical \nconditions as prescribed in in section 1903(v) of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396b(v), 42 CFR \n440.255(c), and for services or benefits funded by Medicaid but provided under the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA); and benefits provided to foreign-born children of U.S. citizen parents;     [cir] Premium and \nCost Sharing Subsidies for Medicare Part D; \\271\\ Benefits provided for institutionalization for long-term care at \ngovernment expense; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\271\\ See 42 U.S.C. 1395w-14. -\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------      [cir] Subsidized Housing under the Housing Act of 1937, \n42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq. (a) Types of Public Benefits     In formulating the proposed definition of public benefits, DHS \ncontemplated pertinent case law, the definition of public benefits in PRWORA, and the treatment of certain public \nbenefits under the current public charge policy. The cases examined draw a distinction between the types of public \nbenefits that are appropriately considered in public charge determinations, and the types that are not. In Matter of \nHarutunian, an INS Regional Commissioner noted a fundamental difference between consideration of \n``individualized public support to the needy'' and ``essentially supplementary benefits directed to the general \nwelfare of the public as a whole.'' \\272\\ The BIA similarly observed a distinction between individualized receipt of \nwelfare benefits and ``the countless municipal and State services which are provided to all residents, alien and \ncitizen alike, without specific charge of the municipality or the State, and which are paid out of the general tax fund'' \nin assessing the relevance of receipt of a government benefit or service to public charge determinations.\\273\\ \nSpecific public benefits considered relevant to public charge determinations have included old age assistance, \nSupplemental Security Income (SSI), and receipt of ``public funds from the New York Department of Social \nServices.'' \\274\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\272\\ See Matter of Harutunian, 14 \nI&N Dec. 583, 589 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974).     \\273\\ See Matter of B --, 3 I&N Dec. 323, 324-25 (BIA 1948).     \\274\\ \nSee Matter of Harutunian 14 I&N Dec. 583, 590 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974) (considering old age assistance for public \ncharge excludability purposes); Matter of Vindman, 16 I&N Dec. 131, 132 (Reg'l Comm'r 1977) (receipt of public \nfunds from the New York Department of Social Services). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nPRWORA, with certain exceptions, defined Federal public benefits as ``any grant, contract, loan, professional \nlicense, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United \nStates; and . . . any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food \nassistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an \nindividual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the \nUnited States.'' \\275\\ DHS believes the definition of public benefits used in PRWORA is in some respects too broad \n\n\n\nfor public charge inadmissibility determinations. The principal reason PRWORA's definition does not work in the \npublic charge inadmissibility determination is that it includes grants, contracts, and licensures that are transactional \nin nature and may involve the exchange of government resources for value provided by the alien.\\276\\ Because \nthey are value-exchanged benefits and do not evidence a lack of self-sufficiency, DHS does not believe that grants, \ncontracts, and licensures are appropriate for consideration in public charge inadmissibility determinations. ------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------      \\275\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1611(c)(1) and (2).     \\276\\ See 8 U.S.C. \n1611(c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Certain cash aid and non-cash benefits \ndirected toward food, housing, and healthcare, on the other hand, are directly relevant to public charge \ninadmissibility determinations. Food, shelter, and necessary medical treatment are basic necessities of life. A \nperson who needs the public's assistance to provide for these basic necessities is not self-sufficient.     DHS \nproposes to consider specific public benefit programs as part of the public charge inadmissibility analysis. \nConsistent with the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, DHS is proposing to consider all federal, state, local, and tribal \ncash assistance for income maintenance as part of the public benefits definition. The receipt of these public benefits \nindicates that the recipient, rather than being self-sufficient, needs the government's assistance to meet basic living \nrequirements such as housing, food, and medical care. Therefore, DHS believes that continuing to consider these \nbenefits in the public charge inadmissibility consideration is appropriate.\\277\\ --------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------      \\277\\ Not all cash assistance would qualify as cash assistance for income maintenance \nunder the proposed rule. For instance, DHS would not consider Stafford Act disaster assistance, including financial \nassistance provided to individuals and households under Individual Assistance under the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency's Individuals and Households Program (42 U.S.C. 5174) as cash assistance for income \nmaintenance. The same would hold true for comparable disaster assistance provided by State, local, or tribal \ngovernments. Other categories of cash assistance that are not intended to maintain a person at a minimum level of \nincome would similarly not fall within the definition. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nDHS also proposes consideration of certain non-cash benefits, because receipt of such benefits is relevant to \ndetermining whether an alien is self-sufficient. DHS recognizes that the universe of non-cash benefits is quite large, \nand that some benefits are more commonly used, at greater taxpayer expense, than others. In addition, \nincorporating specific non-cash benefit programs into the public charge inadmissibility determination entails certain \nindirect costs--for instance, as a result of a final rule, the benefits-granting agency may make changes to forms or to \nenrollment or disenrollment procedures. In light of these considerations, and to provide consistency in adjudications \nand appropriate certainty for aliens and benefits- granting agencies, DHS proposes to incorporate consideration of \na limited list of non-cash benefits in the public charge inadmissibility determination context. Specifically, as indicated \nabove, DHS would consider the following non-cash benefits: Nonemergency Medicaid, Premium and Cost Sharing \nSubsidies for Medicare Part D; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); benefits provided for \ninstitutionalization for  [[Page 51160]]  long-term care at government expense; and housing programs, including \nSection 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, Section 8 Project-Based Rental \nAssistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation), and Subsidized Public Housing.     Cash aid and non-cash benefits \ndirected toward food, housing, and healthcare account for significant federal expenditure on low-income individuals \nand bear directly on self-sufficiency. Table 10 illustrates the estimated average annual public benefits payments \nand average annual benefit for each assistance program under consideration in this rule. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF \nOMITTED] TP10OC18.026      In addition to federal expenditure impact, participation rates in these cash and non-\ncash benefits programs are significant. In fact, participation rates in some non-cash programs are far higher than \nparticipation rates in some cash programs, regardless of a person's immigration status or citizenship. Using the \n2014 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), DHS analyzed data detailing the \nparticipation rates for various cash and non-cash federal public benefits programs.\\286\\ The results suggest that \nreceipt of non-cash public benefits is more prevalent than receipt of cash benefits.\\287\\ When analyzed by nativity \nand citizenship status, the results also suggest comparable levels of program participation by native-born \nindividuals, foreign-born individuals, and noncitizens.\\288\\ DHS recognizes that the SIPP Panel includes \nrespondent-provided data on nativity, citizenship status, and initial immigration status, but does not provide data \non current immigration classification. Additionally, the categories represented in the SIPP immigration status item \ndo not align precisely with the populations covered by this rule--for instance, the results include refugees, asylees, \nand other populations that may access public benefits but are not subject to the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility. The SIPP data and DHS's analysis of this data do not examine whether the receipt of public benefits \nwas authorized, and DHS did not examine program payment rate error information  [[Page 51161]]  for this purpose. \n\n\n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, DHS believes the SIPP data on noncitizen participation is instructive with respect \nto the receipt of non-cash benefits by the noncitizen population on the whole. DHS welcomes comments on its use \nof this data, and whether alternative reliable data sources are available. ----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------      \\278\\ For a list of federal expenditures by program, see fiscal year 2016 data from table 2 of Gene \nFalk et al., Cong.

Finally, the 2014 Panel of SIPP does not \ndistinguish between Medicaid, CHIP, and other types of comprehensive medical assistance for low-income people. \nFor a number of reasons, DHS anticipates that CHIP enrollees represent a relatively small portion of the \n``Medicaid/CHIP'' population. Typically, only persons below age 20 are eligible for CHIP, which reduces its impact \non the overall estimates of Medicaid/CHIP. Furthermore, using data from the 2008 Panel of SIPP (Wave 13, \nreference month 1, representing September through December, 2012), it was found that 0.7 percent of noncitizen \nrespondents reported receiving CHIP, and 23% of noncitizen Medicaid/CHIP recipients below age 20 overall \nreported receiving CHIP. For general reference, see the following publications, in addition to the cited sources in the \npreceding footnotes: Carmen DeNavas-Walt & Bernadette D. Proctor, U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population \nReports: Income and Poverty in the United States: 2013 (Sept. 2014), available at            \n\nI&N Dec. 137 (BIA 1974); Matter of Harutunian 14 I&N Dec. 583 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974).     \\291\\ See U.S. Dep't of \nHealth & Human Servs., Welfare Indicators and Risk Factors, at I-2 (2015), available at            \n\nthe degree to which an alien must be dependent on public benefits to be considered a public charge, DHS has \ndetermined that it is permissible and reasonable to propose a different approach. ii. Fifteen Percent of Federal \nPoverty Guidelines (FPG) Standard for Monetizable Benefits     DHS proposes to consider receipt of monetizable \npublic benefits as listed in 8 CFR 212.21(b)(1), where the cumulative value of one or more of the listed benefits \nexceeds 15 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) for a household of one within any period of 12 \nconsecutive months, based on the per-month average FPG for the months during which the benefits are received. \nThis proposed threshold is most straightforward to calculate within the context of a 12-month period that spans a \nsingle calendar year (January through December). For example, this 15 percent of FPG threshold would exclude up \nto $1,821 worth of monetizable public benefits for a household of one if the monetizable public benefits are received \nfrom January 2018 through December 2018.\\295\\ On the other hand, the threshold requires a slightly more complex \ncalculation when evaluating 12 consecutive months spanning two calendar years. To illustrate, an alien receives \nmonetizable public benefits between April 2017 and March 2018. DHS would compare the amount received for the \n12 consecutive month period against 15 percent of FPG applicable to each month in question. Fifteen percent of \nFPG is $150.75 per month for April through December 2017 and $151.75 per month for January through March \n2018 based on the respective poverty guidelines in effect for calendar years 2017 and 2018, which would equal \n$1,812 for this 12 month consecutive period. In evaluating likely receipt of future monetizable public benefits, DHS \nwould use the FPG in effect on the date of adjudication. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\295\\ The calculation is an FPG of $12,140 for a household of one, multiplied by 0.15. See U.S. Dep't of Health & \nHuman Servs., HHS Poverty Guidelines for 2018, available at            https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines (last \nvisited Feb. 11, 2018). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In formulating this 15 percent of \nFPG threshold, DHS proposes to use FPG as the baseline for the percentage of monetizable public benefits receipt \nbeing considered in the totality of the circumstances because the poverty guidelines are authoritative and \ntransparent. The poverty guidelines are a simplified version of the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds, which \nCensus uses to prepare its estimates of the number of individuals and families in poverty.\\296\\ HHS updates and \nadjusts the FPG annually based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).\\297\\ As HHS \nnotes, a number of federal programs use the poverty guidelines as an eligibility criterion.\\298\\ ``Some federal \nprograms use a percentage multiple of the guidelines (for example, 125 percent or 185 percent of the guidelines)'' \nto determine public benefit eligibility.\\299\\ In the immigration context, DHS uses the FPG as a standard for \npurposes of the affidavit of support requirement under section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C.  [[Page 51165]]  \n1183a.\\300\\ DOS also uses FPG to evaluate immigrant visa applicants who are not subject to the requirements of \n213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, and who are relying solely on personal income to establish eligibility under section \n212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a.\\301\\ The poverty guidelines thus provides a proven, useful, and easily \nadministrable measure of the level of income and resources below which a person becomes increasingly likely to \nneed public benefits to satisfy basic living (and other) needs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---      \\296\\ See Annual Update of the HHS Poverty Guidelines, 83 FR 2642 (Jan. 18, 2018).     \\297\\ See Annual \nUpdate of the HHS Poverty Guidelines, 83 FR 2642 (Jan. 18, 2018).     \\298\\ See Annual Update of the HHS \nPoverty Guidelines, 83 FR 2642 (Jan. 18, 2018).     \\299\\ See Annual Update of the HHS Poverty Guidelines, 83 FR \n2642 (Jan. 18, 2018).     \\300\\ See INA section 213A(f)(1)(E), 8 U.S.C. 1183a(f)(1)(E).     \\301\\ See 22 CFR \n40.41(f). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS believes that the 15 percent threshold is \na reasonable approach. The threshold would not lead to unintended consequences, as could be the case if there \nwas no threshold or the threshold was much smaller. Indeed, DHS recognizes that individuals may receive public \nbenefits for in relatively small amounts to supplement their ability to meet their needs and the needs of their \nhousehold without seriously calling into question their self-sufficiency.     At the same time, DHS believes that an \nindividual who receives monetizable public benefits in excess of 15 percent of FPG is neither self-sufficient nor on \nthe road to achieving self-sufficiency. Receipt of monetizable public benefits above the 15 percent threshold \nexceeds what could reasonably be defined as a nominal level of support that merely supplements an alien's \nindependent ability to meet his or her basic living needs; individuals who receive the designated benefits in such an \namount are not self-sufficient and so would be considered public charges under this rule.     DHS believes the \nproposed 15 percent threshold is consistent with DHS's interpretation of the term public charge and would achieve \nthe policy aims of this proposed rulemaking. The proposed threshold is consistent with the self-sufficiency policy \nobjective set forth in PRWORA that aliens should be able to financially support themselves with their own resources \nor by relying on the aid of family members, without depending on government's assistance.\\302\\ Though not \ndefined in PRWORA, self-sufficiency, as used in PRWORA, is tied to an alien's ability to support him or herself \n\n\nwithout depending on public benefits.\\303\\ DHS seeks public comments on whether the proposed 15 percent \nthreshold applicable to monetizable public benefits is an appropriate threshold in light of the stated goals of the rule. \nFor instance, DHS welcomes the submission of views and data regarding whether the proposed standard is \nappropriate, too low, or too high for assessing reliance on public benefits (and why), and whether there is a more \nappropriate basis for a monetizable threshold, other than value as a percentage of the FPG or duration of receipt, \nthat indicates whether an alien is a public charge. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\302\\ \nSee 8 U.S.C. 1601(a)(2).     \\303\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1601(a)(2). --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-      DHS also seeks public comments on whether DHS should consider the receipt of designated monetizable \npublic benefits at or below the 15 percent threshold as evidence in the totality of the circumstances. For instance, \nDHS could revise the rule to allow adjudicators to assign some weight to past or current receipt of designated \nmonetized public benefits in an amount equal to 10 percent of FPG, and less weight to past or current receipt of \nsuch benefits in an amount equal to 5 percent of FPG. The ultimate inquiry would remain whether the alien is likely \nin the totality of the circumstances to become a public charge, i.e., to receive the designated public benefits above \nthe applicable threshold(s), either in terms of dollar value or duration of receipt. iii. Twelve Month Standard for Non-\nMonetizable Benefits     In addition to proposing a 15 percent threshold for assessing the alien's likelihood to remain \nor become self-sufficient in the context of receipt of monetizable public benefits (e.g., cash assistance and SNAP), \nDHS is proposing to consider the receipt of certain non- monetizable public benefits (e.g., Medicaid) if received for \nmore than 12 cumulative months during a 36-month period. As indicated above, DHS believes that it is appropriate \nto expand the list of previously included public benefits (under the 1999 INS Interim Field Guidance) to include \ncertain non-cash benefits based on the Federal government's expenditures and non-citizen participation rates in \nthose programs. However, following consultation with interagency partners such as HHS and HUD, DHS lacks an \neasily administrable standard for assessing the monetary value of an alien's receipt of some non-cash benefits. \nDHS believes that, like the 15 percent of FPG threshold described above, the duration of the alien's receipt of these \nbenefits over a period of time is also reasonable proxy for assessing an alien's reliance on public benefits.     The \nduration of receipt is a relevant factor under the existing guidance with respect to covered benefits and is \nspecifically accounted for in the guidance's inclusion of long-term institutionalization at government's expense.\\304\\ \nAdditionally, in the context of both state welfare reform efforts and the 1990s Federal welfare reform, Federal \ngovernment and state governments imposed various limits on the duration of benefit receipt as an effort to foster \nself-sufficiency among recipients and prevent long-term or indefinite dependence. States have developed widely \nvarying approaches to time limits. Currently, 40 states have time limits that can result in the termination of families' \nwelfare benefits; 17 of those states have limits of fewer than 60 months.\\305\\ Similarly, on the Federal level, \nPRWORA established a 60- month time limit on the receipt of TANF.\\306\\ -------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------      \\304\\ In assessing the probative value of past receipt of public benefits, ``the length of time . . . is \na significant factor.'' 64 FR 28689, 28690 (May 26, 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).     \\305\\ \nSee, e.g., MDRC, formerly Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, Welfare Time Limits State Policies, \nImplementation, and Effects on Families.            https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/full_607.pdf (last visited \nSep. 12, 2018).     \\306\\ See Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF), Final Rule; 64 FR 17720, \n17723 (Apr. 12, 1999) (``The [Welfare to Work (WtW)] provisions in this rule include the amendments to the TANF \nprovisions at sections 5001(d) and 5001(g)(1) of Pub. L. 105-33. Section 5001(d) allows a State to provide WtW \nassistance to a family that has received 60 months of federally funded TANF assistance . . .''). ----------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------      As with the proposed 15 percent of FPG standard, DHS believes that an \nindividual who receives monetizable public benefits for more than 12 cumulative months during a 36-month period \nis neither self-sufficient nor on the road to achieving self-sufficiency. Receipt of public benefits for such a duration \nexceeds what could reasonably be defined as a nominal level of support that merely supplements an alien's \nindependent ability to meet his or basic living needs. In DHS's view, individuals who receive the non-monetizable \npublic benefits covered by this rule for more than 12 months are unable to meet their basic needs without \ngovernment help; they therefore are not self-sufficient and so would be considered public charges under this rule.     \nBy way of illustration, under the proposed policy, an alien's receipt of Medicaid for 9 months and receipt of public \nhousing for 6 months, if both occurred within the same 36-month period, would amount to 15 months of receipt of \nnon-monetizable benefits, regardless of whether these periods of time overlapped, were consecutive, or occurred at \ndifferent points in time during the 36-month period. As such, the receipt of those benefits would be considered for \npurposes of this rule.  [[Page 51166]]      DHS seeks public comments on this proposed approach, including any \nalternatives for assessing self-sufficiency based on the receipt of non-monetizable benefits. DHS seeks public \n\n\ncomments on whether the proposed 12-month threshold applicable to non-monetizable public benefits is an \nappropriate threshold in light of the stated goals of the rule. For instance, DHS welcomes the submission of views \nand data regarding whether the proposed standard is appropriate, too low, or too high for assessing reliance on \npublic benefits (and why), and whether there is a more appropriate basis for a non-monetizable threshold, other \nthan duration of receipt, that indicates whether an alien is a public charge.     DHS also seeks public comments on \nwhether DHS should consider the receipt of one or more designated non-monetizable public benefits for any period \nless of than 12 months in the aggregate as part of the public charge inadmissibility determination. For instance, \nsimilar to the potential alternative described in the call for comment in the preceding section, DHS could revise the \nrule to allow adjudicators to assign some weight to past or current receipt of 2 designated non- monetized benefits \nfor a total of 8 months, and less weight to past or current receipt of such benefits for a total of 4 months. The \nultimate inquiry would remain whether the alien is likely in the totality of the circumstances to become a public \ncharge, i.e., to receive the designated public benefits above the applicable threshold(s), either in terms of dollar \nvalue or duration of receipt.     DHS is also considering whether there are other potential approaches to monetizing \nthese benefits, and seeks comments on any such alternatives. In addition, DHS seeks comments on the proposed \ntimeframes, including, if applicable, any studies or data that would provide a basis for an alternative duration. iv. \nCombination of Monetizable Benefits Under 15 Percent of FPG and One or More Non-Monetizable Benefits     DHS \nis proposing a separate approach when an alien receives a combination of monetizable benefits in an amount that \nis equal to or less than the proposed 15 percent threshold while also receiving one or more non-monetizable public \nbenefits. This approach is intended to address circumstances where an alien's self-sufficiency is in question by \nvirtue of a combination of receipt of both monetizable and non- monetizable benefits, even if his or her receipt of \nmonetizable designated public benefits does not reach the 15 percent threshold and his or her receipt of non-\nmonetizable benefits does not surpass the 12- month duration threshold. Under this proposal, if an alien receives a \ncombination of monetizable benefits equal to or below the 15 percent threshold together with one or more benefits \nthat cannot be monetized, the threshold for duration of receipt of the non-monetizable benefits would be 9 months \nin the aggregate (rather than 12 months) within a 36- month period (e.g, receipt of two different non-monetizable \nbenefits in one month counts as two months, as would receipt of one non-monetizable benefit for one month in \nJanuary 2018 and another such benefit for one month in June 2018).     DHS believes that reducing the 12-month \ntimeframe by 3 months to account for use of monetizable benefits is a reasonable and easily administrable \nguideline for determining whether an individual who receives both monetizable and non-monetizable public benefits \nis self- sufficient or on the road to achieving self-sufficiency. In line with the other thresholds described above, \nreceipt of a designated non- monetizable public benefits for three-quarters of a year, compounded by receipt of a \ndesignated monetizable public benefit, exceeds what could reasonably be defined as a nominal level of support that \nmerely supplements an alien's independent ability to meet his or basic living needs. In DHS's view, individuals who \nreceive public benefits in these combinations are unable to meet their basic needs without government help, \nconsequently are not self-sufficient, and therefore would be considered public charges under this rule.     DHS \nseeks public comments on this approach, including any alternatives for addressing receipt of a combination of \npublic benefits, some of which can be monetized and others which cannot to ensure a consistent methodology for \ntreating recipients of these two types of benefits. (c) Monetizable Public Benefits i.

Similarly, treatment for mental health disorders was \nintended to be limited to circumstances in which the alien's condition is such that he is a danger to himself or to \nothers and has therefore been judged incompetent by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\\336\\ Over the years since \nthe enactment of PRWORA, courts have refined the definition of emergency medical condition. Depending on the \nstate, and the medical condition, categorization as an ``emergency medical condition'' for purposes of Medicaid \nreimbursement may not be limited to hospital emergency room visits. For example, in Szewczyk v. Department of \nSocial Services,\\337\\ the Supreme Court of Connecticut indicated that coverage for an ``emergency medical \ncondition'' did not limit an alien patient to treatment rendered in the emergency room, but applied to treatment for \nleukemia that had ``reached a crisis stage'' and required ``immediate medical treatment, without which the patient's \nphysical well-being would likely be put in jeopardy or serious physical impairment or dysfunction would result.'' \nHowever, in Diaz v. Division of Social Services and Div. of Medical Assistance, North Carolina Dept. of Health and \nHuman Services,\\338\\ the Supreme Court of North Carolina indicated that an alien's acute lymphocytic leukemia \nwas not an ``emergency medical condition'' where there was is nothing to indicate that the prolonged chemotherapy \ntreatments must have been ``immediate'' to prevent placing the alien's health in serious jeopardy, or causing \nserious impairment or dysfunction.\\339\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\335\\ H.R. \nRep.

Further, \nCongress did not authorize any consideration of an alien's immigration status for purposes of eligibility for these \nbenefits or to allow for continuous services/treatment relating to them. Therefore, DHS will not consider treatment \nfor emergency medical  [[Page 51170]]  conditions funded by Medicaid in the context of a public charge \n\n\n\ndetermination. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\340\\ See Emergency Medical \nTreatment & Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S. Code 1395dd. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nThe second proposed exclusion is for services or benefits under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA) \\341\\ and school- based benefits provided to children who are at or below the oldest age of children eligible \nfor secondary education as determined under State law. The IDEA protects educational opportunities for all \nstudents with disabilities and requires schools to provide certain services to all children with disabilities. States and \nschool districts may bill and receive reimbursement for the cost of providing special education and health care \nrelated services from a State's public insurance program (e.g., Medicaid). Benefits or services under these laws \ngenerally are not based on income eligibility, and where a reimbursement is available, it is provided to the school or \neligible entity. For example, under the statutory framework created by Congress for Part B of IDEA, school districts, \nin meeting their obligation to make a free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities, may \nreceive reimbursement for the cost of providing special education and related services if parents provide consent \nfor the school districts to release their personally identifiable information to a State public insurance program (e.g., \nMedicaid) for billing purposes. Subject to parental consent, schools, and not individual parents or students, may \nobtain reimbursement for the cost of providing certain health-related services included in a child's individualized \neducation program (IEP) that are considered covered services under such subsidized health insurance programs. \nThe IDEA provides in 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(12)(B) that, when a non-educational public agency, such as a State \nMedicaid agency, is assigned responsibility under State or Federal law to provide or pay for any services that are \nalso considered special education and related services, the financial responsibility of the State Medicaid agency or \nother public insurer of children with disabilities must precede that of the LEA or State agency responsible for \ndeveloping a child's IEP. Also, 20 U.S.C. 1412(e) reinforces that Part B of the IDEA may not be construed to permit \na State to reduce medical or other assistance available, or to alter eligibility, under the Social Security Act. There \nare no restrictions on how school districts and schools are permitted to spend any funds that Medicaid or other \npublic insurance program reimburses for the provision of IDEA services. By excluding services provided under \nIDEA that may be funded in whole or in part by Medicaid, DHS would better ensure that schools continue to receive \nfinancial resources to cover the cost of special education and related services, which they would be legally required \nto provide at no cost to the parents regardless of the outcome of this rulemaking. ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------      \\341\\ See 20 U.S.C. 1400-1482. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nc. Exception for Receipt of Medicaid by Foreign-Born Children of U.S. Citizens     DHS proposes to exclude \nconsideration of the receipt of all Medicaid benefits by foreign-born children as defined in section 101(c) of the Act \nwho either have U.S. citizen parents, who have been adopted by U.S. citizens, or who are coming to the United \nStates to be adopted by U.S. citizens, where such children will automatically acquire U.S. citizenship under section \n320 of the Act or be eligible to naturalize under section 322 of the Act upon or after being admitted to the United \nStates. In some cases, these children will acquire citizenship upon finalization of their adoption in the United States, \nunder section 320 of the Act, or the children will naturalize upon taking the Oath of Allegiance (or having it waived) \nunder section 322 of the Act. In other cases, the children will acquire citizenship upon taking up residence in United \nStates in the legal and physical custody of their U.S. citizen parent as a lawful permanent resident.     Alien children \nof U.S. citizens, who must first establish eligibility for admission, are subject to section 212(a)(4) even though they \nmay automatically acquire U.S. citizenship upon taking up residence in the United States after admission as lawful \npermanent residents.\\342\\ Children of U.S. citizens eligible for acquisition of citizenship under section 320 of the \nAct, however, are exempt from the affidavit of support requirement.\\343\\ ---------------------------------------------------------\n------------------      \\342\\ Note that children born abroad to U.S. citizen parents may also acquire U.S. citizenship at \nbirth under certain circumstances, such as where both parents are U.S. citizens and one parent had resided in the \nUnited States prior to the child's birth, or where one parent is a U.S. citizen who was physically present in the \nUnited States for at least five years, two of which were after age 14. Such children would enter the United States as \nU.S. citizens and would not be subject to an admissibility determination. See INA sections 301 and 309, 8 U.S.C. \n1401 and 1409.

See INA section 101(c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1101(c)(1). ---------------------------------------------------------------\n------------      Children of U.S. citizens, including those adopted abroad, typically receive one of several types of \n\n\nimmigrant visas as listed below and are admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents.

In the majority of cases, adoptions are finalized in the \ncountry of origin before the child enters the United States and the child automatically acquires U.S. citizenship. A \nminority of children whose adoptions are not finalized until after their admission do not automatically acquire \ncitizenship after admission, but may acquire it upon being readopted, and are eligible to naturalize after they have \nbeen finally adopted in the United States or had the foreign adoption recognized by the state where they are \npermanently residing.

Parents and legal guardians at the time of adjudication of a petition may have sufficient \nsources to provide for the alien in the future and may also have the ability to gather assets and resources for the \nalien's future care (i.e. long-term care insurance). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\358\\ \nSee Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Institutional Long Term Care, available at            \n\n\\365\\ See Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Guidance to States on the Low Income Subsidy Guidance 5 (Feb. \n2009), available at            https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Eligibility-and-\nEnrollment/LowIncSubMedicarePresCov/Downloads/StateLISGuidance021009.pdf.     \\366\\ See Ctrs. for Medicare \n& Medicaid Servs., Guidance to States on the Low Income Subsidy Guidance 5 (Feb. 2009), available at            \n\n\nThe program is funded jointly by states and the federal government.\\379\\ --------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------      \\375\\ See 42 U.S.C. 1397aa to 1397mm.     \\376\\ Beginning with the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA), SCHIP was referred to simply as CHIP.

At the same time, DHS recognizes that this program does not involve the same level of expenditure \nas most of the other programs listed in this proposed rule, and that noncitizen participation in these programs is \ncurrently relatively low.\\381\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\380\\ DHS would not \nconsider services or benefits funded by CHIP but provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA), 20 U.S.C. 1400-1482, nor would DHS consider school-based services provided to children who are at or \nbelow the oldest age of children eligible for secondary education as determined under State law.     \\381\\ An \nanalysis of Wave 13 of the 2008 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) suggests that 0.7 \npercent of noncitizens reported receiving CHIP benefits. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nDHS is nonetheless considering including this program in a final rule, because the total Federal expenditure for the \nprogram remains significant, and because it does provide for basic living needs (i.e., medical care), similar to \nMedicaid (elements of which are included on the proposed list of public benefits). DHS specifically requests public \ncomments on whether to include CHIP in the final rule. (h) Request for Comment Regarding Public Benefit Receipt \nby Certain Alien Children     The language of the public charge statute under section 212(a)(4)(B)(i) of the Act states \nthat an alien's ``age'' shall be one of several minimum enumerated considerations in a public charge determination, \nalongside ``health,'' ``family status,'' ``assets, resources, and financial status,'' and ``education and skills.'' Each of \nthese factors must be taken into account in determining whether an alien will be a charge on the federal taxpayer. \nThe United States has separate immigration programs, such as refugee admissions and asylum, where aliens \nregardless of age and financial circumstance are exempted from public charge inadmissibility. Alien children who \nare not asylees, refugees, or otherwise exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility are subject to it, just \nas adult aliens are. However, because the public charge inadmissibility determination is a prospective determination \nin the totality of the circumstances, the circumstances surrounding an alien's receipt of public benefits as a child, \nincluding the age at which such benefits were received, are a relevant consideration. For instance, as alien children \napproach or reach adulthood, they may age out of eligibility for certain benefits, choose to disenroll from such \nbenefits (for which their parents may have enrolled them), or modify their chances of becoming self- sufficient \ndepending upon whether they acquire education and skills, secure employment, and accumulate assets and \nresources. Therefore, DHS seeks public comment on the best mechanism to administer public charge \ninadmissibility determinations for those aliens who receive benefits while under the age of majority (frequently 18) \nor while still children under section 101(b) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b). DHS is particularly interested in views and \ndata that would inform whether and to what extent DHS should weigh past or current receipt of benefits by such an \nalien in the totality of the circumstances as a potential indicator of likely future receipt of public benefits. (i) Request \nfor Comment Regarding Potential Modifications by Public Benefit Granting Agencies     DHS recognizes that as a \nresult of a future final rule, some benefit-granting agencies may decide to modify enrollment processes and \nprogram documentation for designated benefits programs. For instance, agencies may choose to advise potential \nbeneficiaries of the potential immigration consequences of receiving certain public benefits. DHS requests public \ncomments regarding such potential modifications, including information regarding how long it would take to make \nsuch modifications, and the resources required to make such modifications. DHS may use this information to \ndetermine the appropriate effective date for a final rule, among other purposes. DHS seeks comments and \nrecommendations from potentially affected state, local and tribal governments and from the public generally. 3. \nLikely at Any Time To Become a Public Charge     DHS proposes to define ``likely at any time to become a public \ncharge'' to mean likely at any time in the future to receive one or more public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR \n212.21(b), based on the totality of the alien's circumstances. Under this proposed definition, DHS would find an \n\n\nalien inadmissible as a public charge if DHS finds the alien is likely at any time in the future to receive one or more \npublic benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), in an amount or for a duration exceeding the thresholds described \nabove.     DHS proposes to distinguish between an alien who is a public charge based on current receipt of public \nbenefits and an alien who is likely to become a public charge at any time in the future. This distinction is consistent \nwith the prospective nature of the statute. DHS understands that its proposed definition of public charge may \nsuggest that DHS would automatically find an alien who is currently receiving public benefits, as defined in this \nproposed rule, to be inadmissible as likely to become a public charge. But DHS does not propose to establish a per \nse policy whereby an alien is likely at any time to become a public charge if the alien is receiving public benefits at \nthe time of the application for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status. Under the ``likely at any time to become a \npublic charge'' definition, an alien who is currently receiving public benefits is not necessarily inadmissible, because \ncurrent receipt of public benefits does not automatically mean that the alien is likely to receive public benefits at any \ntime in the future.     As discussed above and explained further below, receiving public benefits by itself does not \nestablish that an alien is likely to become a public charge; rather, as set forth in the statute, a public charge \ninadmissibility determination requires a determination predicated on an opinion as to the likelihood of future \nevents.\\382\\ Accordingly, as set forth in proposed 8 CFR 212.21, DHS proposes that an alien who is currently \nreceiving public benefits is not necessarily inadmissible, because such current receipt of public benefits does not \nnecessarily mean that  [[Page 51175]]  the alien will continue to receive public benefits at any time in the future. -----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------      \\382\\ See INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). ------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------  4. Household     For purposes of public charge inadmissibility \ndeterminations under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), DHS proposes to consider the alien's \nhousehold size as part of the family status factor, as well as the assets, resources, and financial status factor. The \nnumber of people in the alien's household has an effect on the alien's assets and resources, and in many cases \nmay influence the likelihood that an alien will become a public charge. Household size would be used to determine \nwhether the alien's household income is at least 125 percent of the FPG in the public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination, because the alien is either a head of household who has responsibilities to the household or is a \nmember of a household who is supported by other members of the household beyond the sponsor. DHS notes that \nwhile the number of children, including U.S. citizen children, may count towards an alien's household size for \npurposes of determining inadmissibility on the public charge ground, the direct receipt of public benefits by those \nchildren would not factor into the public charge inadmissibility determination.     As discussed in greater detail \nbelow, in developing the proposed definition of an alien's household, DHS reviewed the individuals that public \nbenefit granting agencies include as part of a household and/or as dependents in determining eligibility for a public \nbenefit, as well as how USCIS determines household size and income in the affidavit of support context. The \nindividuals identified as part of the alien's household are intended to include individuals who are financially \ninterdependent with the alien, either legally or otherwise. (a) Definition of Household in Public Charge Inadmissibility \nContext     DHS proposes to define an alien's household for the purposes of making a public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination as follows. First, if the alien is 21 years of age or older, or under the age of 21 and married, and \ntherefore not a child as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), the alien's household would \ninclude:      The alien;      The alien's spouse, if physically residing with the alien;      The alien's children, as defined \nin section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), physically residing with the alien;      The alien's other children, \nas defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), not physically residing with the alien for whom the \nalien provides or is required to provide at least 50 percent of financial support, as evidenced by a child support \norder or agreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or agreement specifying the amount of \nfinancial support to be provided to the alien;      Any other individuals (including a spouse not physically residing \nwith the alien) to whom the alien provides, or is required to provide, at least 50 percent of the individual's financial \nsupport, or who are listed as a dependent on the alien's federal income tax return; and      Any individual who \nprovides to the alien at least 50 percent of the alien's financial support, or who lists the alien as a dependent on his \nor her federal income tax return.     Thus, for example, the applicant's household size would include the applicant, \nher children, and her parents, if:      The applicant is an unmarried 23 year-old applicant for adjustment of status;      \nThe applicant lives with two children and her parents, who provide 53 percent of financial support to the applicant; \nand      The applicant has no other individuals for whom she provides or is required to provide (or from whom she \nreceives) financial support or who list her on their tax return.  DHS would consider the income, assets, and \nresources of all of these household members (total of 5) in determining whether the applicant has income at or \nabove 125 percent of the FPG.      Second, if the alien is a child as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n\n\n\n1101(b)(1), the alien's household would include:      The alien;      The alien's children, as defined in section \n101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), physically residing with the alien;      The alien's other children, as defined \nin section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), not physically residing with the alien, for whom the alien \nprovides or is required to provide at least 50 percent of the children's financial support, as evidenced by a child \nsupport order or agreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or agreement specifying the amount \nof financial support to be provided by the alien;      The alien's parents, legal guardians, or any other individuals \nproviding or required to provide at least 50 percent of financial support to the alien as evidenced by a child support \norder or agreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or agreement specifying the amount of \nfinancial support to be provided by the alien;      The parents' or legal guardians' other children, as defined in section \n101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), physically residing with the alien;      The parents' or legal guardians' other \nchildren, as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), not physically residing with the alien for \nwhom the parent or legal guardian provides or is required to provide at least 50 percent of the other children's \nfinancial support, as evidenced by a child support order or agreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other \norder or agreement specifying the amount of financial support to be provided by the parents or legal guardians; and      \nAny other individuals to whom the alien's parents or legal guardians provide or are required to provide at least at \nleast 50 percent of the individuals' financial support, or who are listed as a dependent on the parents' or legal \nguardians' federal income tax return.     For example, if a five year old is applying for adjustment of status, the \napplicant's household would include the applicant, the applicant's mother and father, the applicant's two siblings, \nand the applicant's maternal grandparents, if:      The applicant lives with his mother, father, and two siblings and \nhas no other siblings;      The mother and father provide 52 percent of the financial support to the mother's parents \n(i.e., the alien's maternal grandparents) and do not and are not required to provide financial support to anyone else;      \nNobody else provides financial support to the applicant;      Neither the mother or the father have any other children \nand have no other dependents listed on their tax return; and      The mother and father do not receive financial \nsupport from anyone else.  DHS would consider the income of all of the above individuals in determining whether \nthe alien can meet 125 percent of the FPG.      As another example, if an 18 year old is applying for adjustment of \nstatus, the alien's household would only include the alien and the alien's daughter, if:  [[Page 51176]]       The 18 \nyear old lives in her own apartment with only her 1 year old daughter;      The applicant has no other children or \nsiblings;      The applicant does not receive any financial support from his or her parents or any other individual and \nhas no legal guardian;      No individuals are required to provide the applicant with any financial support; and      The \napplicant's parents and the applicant do not provide and are not required to provide any support to anyone else and \nlist no one else as a dependent on their federal income tax returns.  The proposed household definition would not \ninclude any person employed by the household who is living in the home, such as a nanny, or an individual who is \nrenting a part of the home from one of the household members, or a landlord, unless such individual otherwise \nmeets one of the enumerated criteria. (b) Definitions of ``Household'' and Similar Concepts in Other Public Benefits \nContexts     The poverty guidelines do not define who should be considered part of the household, and different \nagencies and programs have different requirements.\\383\\ Public benefit granting agencies generally consider an \napplicant's income for purposes of public benefit eligibility and either use the household size or family size to \ndetermine the income threshold needed to qualify for a public benefit. Each federal program or State determines the \ngeneral eligibility requirements needed to qualify for the public benefits and how to define whose income is included \nfor purposes of determining income based eligibility thresholds. For example, SNAP uses the term ``household'' \nand includes everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together. DHS is not proposing to \nincorporate the SNAP definition because an alien or an individual who is financially responsible for the alien's \nsupport may not have the legal responsibility to support each person living in the home. Instead, the proposed DHS \ndefinition would take into account individuals for whom the alien or the alien's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) or other \nindividual is providing at least 50 percent of financial support because such expenditure would have significant \nbearing on whether the alien has sufficient assets and resources in the context of a public charge determination. ----\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------      \\383\\ See Annual Update of the HHS Poverty Guidelines, \n83 FR 2642 (Jan. 18, 2018). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD), per the 1937 Act, uses the term ``families'' \\384\\ which includes: (i) Single \npersons in the case of an elderly person, a disabled person, a displaced person, the remaining member of a tenant \nfamily, and any other single persons; or (ii) families with children and in the cases of elderly families, near-elderly \nfamilies, and disabled families respectively.\\385\\ The U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (The 1937 Act) \\386\\ requires that \ndwelling units assisted under it must be rented only to families who are low-income \\387\\ at the time of their initial \n\n\n\noccupancy. Section 3 of the 1937 Act also defines income as income from all sources of each member of the \nhousehold, excluding earned income of minors, as determined by the Secretary. Beyond the statutory framework \ndefining families, and as provided by the 1937 Act, HUD allows public housing agencies the discretion to determine \nparticularities related to family composition, as determined under each public housing agency's plan. -------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------      \\384\\ See U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev., Occupancy Handbook \nch. 3 (June 2007), available at            https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/DOC_35645.PDF.     \\385\\ The term \nincludes in cases of elderly, near-elderly, and disabled families, 2 or more elderly persons, near-elderly persons, or \npersons with disabilities living together, and 2 or more such persons living with 1 or more persons determined under \nthe public housing agency plan to be essential to their care of well-being. See U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev., \nOccupancy Handbook ch. 3 (June 2007), available at            \n\nAug. 10, 2018). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS believes that the ``at least 50 \npercent of financial support'' threshold as used by the IRS is reasonable to apply to the determination of who \nbelongs in an alien's household, without regard to whether these individuals physically reside in the alien's home. \nThis would include those individuals the alien may not have a legal responsibility to support but may nonetheless be \nsupporting. For example, this may include a parent, legal guardian, sibling, or a grandparent living with the alien, or \nan adult child, sibling, or any other adult who the alien may be supporting or required to support or who contributes \nto the alien's financial support. (c) Definitions of Household and Similar Concepts in Other Immigration Contexts     \nDHS also considered how household size is determined in the affidavit of support context. There, USCIS defines \nthe terms ``household income'' and ``household size.'' \\393\\ ``Household income'' is used to determine whether a \nsponsor meets the minimum income requirements based on the FPG.\\394\\ The affidavit of support household \nincome generally includes the income of: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\393\\ See 8 \nCFR 213a.1.     \\394\\ See INA section 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----       The sponsor;      The sponsor's spouse;      Any other person included in determining the sponsor's \nhousehold size who must also be over the age of 18 and must have signed the additional household member \ncontract through the Form I-864A; and      The intending immigrant only if he or she either is the sponsor's spouse \nor has the same principal residence as the sponsor and certain additional criteria.\\395\\ --------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------      \\395\\ See 8 CFR 213a.1.  Also, in the affidavit of support context, the ``household \nsize'' is --------------------------------------------------------------------------- generally defined as the total number of people \nincluding:       The sponsor;      The intending immigrant(s) being sponsored on the Form I- 864; \\396\\ -------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------      \\396\\ If a child, as defined in INA section 101(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \n1101(b)(1), or spouse of the principal intending immigrant is an alien who does not currently reside in the United \nStates and who either is not seeking to immigrate at the same time as, or will not seek to immigrate within six \nmonths of the principal intending immigrant's immigration, the sponsor may exclude that child or spouse in \ncalculating the sponsor's household size.       The sponsor's spouse;      All of the sponsor's children as defined in \n101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), (including a stepchild who meets the requirements of 101(b)(1)(b) of the \nAct, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), unless the stepchild does not reside with the sponsor, is not claimed by the sponsor as a \ndependent for tax purposes, and is not seeking to immigrate based on the stepparent/stepchild relationship), \nexcept those children that have reached the age of majority or are emancipated under the law of the person's \ndomicile and are not claimed as dependents on the sponsor's most recent tax return;      Any other persons \n(whether related to the sponsor or not) whom the sponsor has claimed as dependents on the sponsor's federal \nincome tax return for the most recent tax year, even if such persons do not have the same principal residence as \nthe sponsor;      Any aliens the sponsor has sponsored under any other affidavit of support for whom the sponsor's \nsupport obligation has not terminated; and      If the sponsor elects, any siblings, parents, and/or adult children who \nhave the same principal residence as the sponsor, and have combined their income with the sponsor's income by \nsubmitting Form I- 864A.\\397\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\397\\ See 8 CFR 213a.1, \n213a.2(c)(2)(i)(C)(1). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The affidavit of support is part of \nthe public charge determination in that an alien who is required to submit an affidavit of support pursuant to sections \n212(a)(4)(C) and (D) of the Actbut does not submit a sufficient affidavit of support is de facto deemed to be \ninadmissible as likely to become a public charge. In addition, because the affidavit of support serves as an \nagreement that the sponsor will use his or her resources to support the alien if necessary, DHS is proposing to \nconsider the affidavit of support in the totality of the circumstances when determining whether the alien is likely at \nany time to become a public charge. However, the proposed definition of household in this rule does not specifically \ninclude or exclude the sponsor and the sponsor's household. Rather, DHS is only including those persons who rely \nupon or contribute to the alien's asserts and resources. Therefore, if the sponsor is already providing 50 percent or \nmore of financial support to the alien, the sponsor would be included in the proposed definition of household. For \nexample, when a child, as defined in section 101(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), is filing for adjustment of status \nas the child of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, the affidavit of support sponsor would also be the parent. \nBecause the parent is part of the household, the parent's income would be included as part of the household \nincome.\\398\\ The parent's income would be reviewed as part of the assets, resources, and financial status factor \nbased on the total household size. However, for example, if there is a co-sponsor, who is the alien's cousin and \nwho is not physically residing with the alien, then the cousin would not be counted as part of the household and his \nor her income would not be included as part of the assets, resources or financial status unless the sponsor is \nalready contributing 50 percent or more of the alien's financial support. -----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n----------------      \\398\\ See INA section 213A(3)(f), 8 U.S.C. 1183a(3)(f). ----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------      In addition, if the sponsor is a member of the alien's household and included in the calculation of \nthe 125 percent of the FPG, DHS would only count the sponsor's income once for purposes of determining the \nalien's total household assets and resources. A sponsor's income as reported on the affidavit of support would be \nadded to the income of the other members of the alien's household. The sponsor's income that is added to the \nalien's total household assets and resources would not be increased because the sponsor also submitted an \naffidavit of support promising to support the alien at least 125 percent of the FPG for the sponsor's household size. \nFor example, assuming the alien and sponsor's household sizes are the same, if the sponsor's total income \nreported on the affidavit of support is 250 percent of the FPG for the household size, that income would be added to \nthe alien's assets and resources; the alien's total household income would then be at least 250 percent of the FPG, \nwhich constitutes a heavily weighed positive factor.     As discussed above, in proposing this definition of \nhousehold, DHS aims to account for both (1) the persons whom the alien is supporting and (2) those persons who \nare contributing to the household, and thus the alien's assets and resources. DHS believes that an alien's ability to \nsupport a household is relevant to DHS's consideration of the alien's assets, resources, financial status, and family \nstatus. DHS recognizes that household circumstances can vary and expects the proposed definition could in certain \ncircumstances be over- or under- inclusive. DHS welcomes public comments on who should be counted as \nmembers of a household, and whose  [[Page 51178]]  income, assets and resources should be reviewed in the \ntotality of the circumstances when USCIS makes a public charge inadmissibility determination.  C. Public Charge \nInadmissibility Determination      DHS proposes codifying the public charge inadmissibility determination as a \nprospective determination based on the totality of an alien's circumstances at the time of adjudication. As provided \nby statute, if an alien is required to provide an affidavit of support and the affidavit is insufficient, the alien will be \nfound inadmissible based on public charge regardless of any other evidence the alien may submit.\\399\\ ---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------      \\399\\ See INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). ----------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------  1. Absence of a Required Affidavit of Support     Section 212(a)(4) of \nthe Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), permits DHS to consider any submitted affidavit of support under 213A of the Act, 8 \nU.S.C. 1183a, in public charge inadmissibility determinations. The absence of a statutorily required affidavit of \nsupport under section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, conclusively establishes an alien's inadmissibility on public \ncharge grounds.\\400\\ Family-sponsored immigrants and employment-based immigrants petitioned by a relative (or \nby an entity in which a relative has a significant ownership interest) are subject to such a requirement.\\401\\ Other \nthan failure to submit an affidavit of support when required under section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, DHS \nwould not make a public charge determination based on any single factor.\\402\\ ------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------      \\400\\ See INA section 212(a)(4)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C); 8 CFR 213a.2.     \\401\\ See \nINA sections 212(a)(4) and 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), 1183a.     \\402\\ See generally Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 \nI&N Dec. 409, 421-22 (Att'y Gen. 1964). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. Prospective \nDetermination Based on Totality of Circumstances     As noted above, section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), uses the words ``likely at any time.'' \\403\\ DHS's review is predictive: An assessment of an alien's \nlikelihood at any time in the future to become a public charge.\\404\\ DHS would, as required by the statute, assess \nwhether the alien is likely to become a public charge and not whether the alien is currently a public charge. While \npast or current receipt of public benefits may make an alien, at present, a public charge, the past or current receipt \nof public benefits, alone, is insufficient to sustain a finding that an alien is likely to become a public charge at any \npoint in the future.\\405\\ Other than an absent or insufficient required affidavit of support,\\406\\ no single factor or \ncircumstance that Congress mandated DHS to consider, or which DHS may otherwise determine to consider, would \ndetermine the outcome of a public charge inadmissibility determination. ----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------      \\403\\ The ``likely'' language in the public charge inadmissibility provision also appeared in the initial \ncodification in the INA of 1952. See ch. 477, 66 Stat. 163, 183.     \\404\\ See Matter of Perez, 15 I&N Dec. 136, 137 \n(BIA 1974) (concluding that the determination of whether an alien is likely to become a public charge requires \nconsideration of the totality of circumstances, including specific circumstances such as mental or physical disability, \nhealth, age, current reliance on welfare benefits, capacity to find employment, and friends or relatives in the United \nStates willing and able to provide assistance); see also Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689, 28689-93 (May, 26 1999) (in addition to the statutory factors, the public \ncharge inadmissibility analysis also includes consideration of the alien's current and past receipt of cash public \nassistance for income maintenance, repayment of cash public assistance, current or past institutionalization for \nlong- term care at government expense, specific circumstances ``reasonably tending to show that the burden of \n\n\n\nsupporting the alien is likely to be cast on the public,'' and whether the alien has a sponsor who is willing and able to \nassist).     \\405\\ See Matter of Perez, 15 I&N Dec. 136, 137 (BIA 1974) (``The fact that an alien has been on welfare \ndoes not, by itself, establish that he or she is likely to become a public charge.'').     \\406\\ See INA section 213A, 8 \nU.S.C. 1183a. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Consistent with the statute, DHS \nproposes to codify the totality of the circumstances standard,\\407\\ as follows: An alien's age; health; family status; \nassets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills.

     The sufficiency of the \nalien's funds for self-support;      The obligation and sufficiency of sponsorship to assure that the alien will not need \npublic support; and      The ability of the alien to remedy any current dependence on public benefits in the United \nStates, as evidenced or impacted by the alien's age, health, ability to earn a living, funds, and sponsorship.\\412\\ ----\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------      \\412\\ DHS derived this framework from its analysis of the \nstatements and findings in Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I&N Dec. 409 (Att'y Gen. 1964), Matter of Harutunian 14 \nI&N Dec. 583 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974), Matter of Perez 15 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 1974), Matter of Vindman 16 I&N Dec. \n131 (Reg'l Comm'r 1977), and Matter of A--, 19 I&N Dec. 867 (Comm'r 1988). --------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------      To illustrate, in Matter of Martinez-Lopez,\\413\\ rather than concluding that the respondent \nwas likely to become a public charge based solely on the fact that the respondent had no job offer in  [[Page \n51179]]  the United States, the Attorney General considered the respondent's future ability to earn a living based on \nhis 10-year work history in the United States, his age, and his health.\\414\\ The Attorney General also considered \nthe fact that the respondent had a brother and other close family members who could provide financial \nsupport.\\415\\ In Matter of Perez,\\416\\ the Board made clear that the respondent's past and current receipt of \nwelfare was not determinative as to whether she was likely to become a public charge in the future, instead looking \nto the totality of her circumstances, including her age, health, ability to find employment in the future, and the \navailability of family support.\\417\\ In Matter of A--,\\418\\ although the respondent and her husband had been \nunemployed for the 4 years prior to the filing of her application for temporary resident status, the INS Commissioner \nheld that the respondent was not likely to become a public charge ``due to her age and ability to earn a living,'' as \n\n\n\nshown by her recent employment among other factors.\\419\\ -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--      \\413\\ See 10 I&N Dec. 409 (Att'y Gen. 1964).     \\414\\ See 10 I&N Dec. 409, 422-23 (Att'y Gen. 1964).     \\415\\ \nSee 10 I&N Dec. 409, 423 (Att'y Gen. 1964).     \\416\\ 15 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 1974).     \\417\\ 15 I&N Dec. 136, 137 \n(BIA 1974).     \\418\\ 19 I&N Dec. 867 (Comm'r 1988). DHS notes, however, that this case involves the special \npublic charge rule applicable only to applications under INA section 245A, 8 U.S.C. 1255a.     \\419\\ See 19 I&N \nDec. 867, 870 (Comm'r 1988). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      An INS Regional \nCommissioner took a similar totality of the circumstances approach in Matter of Harutunian \\420\\ and determined \nthat the respondent in that case was inadmissible as likely to become a public charge because the respondent \nlacked the means to support herself, the ability to earn a living, and the presence of a sponsor to assure that she \nwould not need public support.\\421\\ Furthermore, the alien was increasingly likely to become dependent, disabled, \nand sick because of her older age, and accordingly was expected to become dependent on old-age assistance for \nsupport.\\422\\ Similarly, an INS Regional Commissioner, in Matter of Vindman, held that a husband and wife were \ninadmissible as likely to become public charges, because they had been receiving public benefits for approximately \nthree years, they were unemployed in the United States, and they presented no prospect of future \nemployment.\\423\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\420\\ Matter of Harutunian 14 I&N \nDec. 583 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974).     \\421\\ See 14 I&N Dec. 583, 589-90 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974).     \\422\\ See 14 I&N \nDec. 583, 589-90 (Reg'l Comm'r 1974).     \\423\\ See Matter of Vindman, 16 I&N Dec. 131, 132 (Reg'l Comm'r \n1977). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS proposes that certain factors and \ncircumstances would generally carry heavy weight, as discussed below. The weight given to an individual factor not \ndesignated as carrying heavy weight would depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each case and the \nrelationship of the factor to other factors in the analysis. Some facts and circumstances may be positive while other \nfacts and circumstances may be negative. Any factor or circumstance that decreases the likelihood of an applicant \nbecoming a public charge is positive; any factor or circumstance that increases the likelihood of an applicant \nbecoming a public charge is negative. Multiple factors operating together may be weighed more heavily since those \nfactors in tandem may show that the alien is already a public charge or is or is not likely to become one.     For \nexample, an alien's assets, resources, and financial status together would frequently carry considerable positive \nweight, because they are the most tangible factors to consider in public charge determinations. An alien's assets, \nresources, and financial status examined together may show that the alien is not likely to be a public charge despite \nconcerns about the alien's age, education, skills, and health. At the same time, an alien's assets, resources, and \nfinancial status examined together may be so limited that a finding that the alien is not likely to become a public \ncharge would have to be based on positive attributes associated with the alien's education, skills, health, family \nstatus, age, or sponsorship.     Ultimately, DHS recognizes that, as the Attorney General has noted, ``the statute \nrequires more than a showing of a possibility that the alien will require public support. Some specific circumstance, \nsuch as mental or physical disability, advanced age, or other fact reasonably tending to show that the burden of \nsupporting the alien is likely to be cast on the public, must be present.'' \\424\\ Indeed, if DHS finds that the specific \npositive factors and circumstances outweigh the specific negative factors and circumstances in an alien's case, \nindicating that the alien is less likely than not to receive one or more public benefits at any time in the future as \ndescribed in 8 CFR 212.21(b), then DHS would conclude that the alien is not likely to become a public charge. If \nDHS finds that the specific negative factors and circumstances outweigh the specific positive factors and \ncircumstances in an alien's case indicating that the alien is more likely than not to receive public benefits as \ndescribed in 8 CFR 212.21(b), at any time in the future, then DHS would conclude that the applicant is likely to \nbecome a public charge.\\425\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\424\\ Matter of Martinez-\nLopez, 10 I&N Dec. 409, 421 (Att'y Gen. 1964).     \\425\\ As explained, the proposed public charge policy is \nconsistent with the totality of the circumstances approach undertaken by the former INS Commissioner in Matter of \nA--. We recognize the Commissioner, in that decision, cited an earlier decision of the Attorney General for the \nproposition that ``[a] healthy person in the prime of life cannot ordinarily be considered likely to become a public \ncharge, especially where he has friends or relatives in the United States who have indicated their ability and \nwillingness to come to his assistance in case of emergency.'' 19 I&N Dec. 867, 869 (Comm'r 1988) (quoting Matter \nof Martinez-Lopez, 10 I&N Dec. 409, 421-22 (Att'y Gen. 1964)). In Matter of A-- and Matter of Martinez-Lopez, the \nINS Commissioner and the Attorney General, respectively, implicitly acknowledge that, although individuals in the \nprime of life will not ordinarily become public charges, they certainly may; otherwise, it would have been pointless to \nassert that what ordinarily is the case is especially true in certain instances. See Matter of A--, 19 I&N Dec. 867, \n869 (Comm'r 1988) (acknowledging that ``all factors should be considered in their totality'' in determining whether \n\n\n\nan individual is likely to become a public charge). Accordingly, adverse factors particular to a given circumstance \nmay counterbalance what otherwise is ordinarily true in a vacuum, such that aliens may still be found inadmissible \nunder INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4) notwithstanding their being ``in the prime of life.'' Also consistent \nwith those decisions, which instruct that additional positive weight should be afforded where friends or relatives in \nthe United States are willing and able to assist in emergencies, DHS would give positive weight to a Form I-864, \nAffidavit of Support, that satisfies statutory and regulatory requirements and to income and resources of certain \nhousehold members, although the filing of the Form I-864 and shared resources likewise would not be \ndeterminative. To the extent this proposed rule may be viewed as inconsistent with Matter of A--, however, including \nbecause the scope of the public benefits covered by this proposed rule is broader than under the longstanding \nadministration of the public charge ground, and the threshold for being considered a public charge under the \ndefinition of that term in this proposed rule is lower than it has been for at least the past two decades, that decision \nwould be superseded if this rule is finalized as drafted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  D. \nAge      An alien's age is a mandatory factor that must be considered when determining whether an alien is likely to \nbecome a public charge in the future.\\426\\ As discussed below, a person's age may impact his or her ability to \nlegally or physically work and is therefore relevant to being self-sufficient, and the likelihood of becoming a public \ncharge. Accordingly, DHS proposes to consider the alien's age primarily in relation to employment or employability, \nand secondarily to other  [[Page 51180]]  factors as relevant to determining whether someone is likely to become a \npublic charge. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\426\\ See INA section 212(a)(4)(B), 8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Specifically, DHS proposes to \nassess whether the alien is between 18 and the minimum ``early retirement age'' for social security purposes (see \n42 U.S.C. 416(l)(2)) (61 as of 2017), and whether the alien's age otherwise makes the alien more or less likely to \nbecome a public charge, such as by impacting the alien's ability to work. DHS would consider a person's age \nbetween 18 and 61 as a positive factor in the totality of the circumstances, and consider a person's age under 18 or \nover 61 to be a negative factor in the totality of the circumstances when determining the likelihood of becoming a \npublic charge. However, DHS acknowledges that people under the age of 18 and over the age of 61 may be \nworking or have adequate means of support, and would recognize such means as positive factors.     The 18 \nthrough 61 age range is based on the age at which people are generally able to work full-time and the age at which \npeople are generally able to retire with some social security retirement benefits under Federal law.\\427\\ At one end \nof the spectrum, children under the age of 18 generally face difficulties working full-time.\\428\\ In general, the Fair \nLabor Standards Act sets 14 years of age as the minimum age for employment, and limits the number of hours \nworked by children until the age of 16.\\429\\ States have varying laws addressing at what age and for how many \nhours children may work up to the age of 18.\\430\\ Further, most States require children to attend school until a \ncertain age, generally until the ages of 16 or 18.\\431\\ DHS notes that the Fair Labor Standards Act provides for \ncertain exemptions for children under 16 to work,\\432\\ and children may be otherwise able to work. ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------      \\427\\ See 29 U.S.C. 213(c), 42 U.S.C. 416(l)(2).     \\428\\ See 29 U.S.C. \n213(c); 29 CFR part 570; see also Dep't of Labor, Table of Employment/Age Certification Issuance Practice Under \nState Child Labor Laws, available at            https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/certification.htm (last updated Jan. 1, \n2018).     \\429\\ See 29 U.S.C. 213(c); 29 CFR part 570; see also Dep't of Labor, Table of Employment/Age \nCertification Issuance Practice Under State Child Labor Laws, available at            \n\nvisited Sept. 10, 2018).     \\434\\ See 42 U.S.C. 416(l); see also U.S. Soc.

Individuals under the age of 18 \nmay be more likely to qualify for and receive public benefits. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 18 percent of \npersons under the age of 18 (13,253,000) and 11.1 percent of persons aged 18 and over (27,363,000) lived below \nthe poverty level in 2016.\\435\\ The U.S. Census Bureau also reported that persons under the age of 18 were more \nlikely to receive means-tested benefits than all other age groups.\\436\\ ------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------      \\435\\ See Jessica L.

[as well as] the likelihood, that because of the condition, the applicant will \nrequire  [[Page 51183]]  extensive medical care or institutionalization.'' \\459\\ A waiver of the health-related ground of \ninadmissibility is available for communicable diseases of public health significance, physical or mental disorder \naccompanied by harmful behavior, and lack of vaccinations.\\460\\ ------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------      \\459\\ 42 CFR 34.4(b)(2).     \\460\\ See INA section 212(g)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1182(g)(1). Although a waiver is \nunavailable for inadmissibility due to drug abuse or addiction, an applicant may still overcome this inadmissibility if \nhis or her drug abuse or addiction is found to be in remission. See Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Technical \nInstructions for Panel Physicians and Civil Surgeons, Remission, available at            \n\nconsideration in the totality of the circumstances.     In addition to the types of evidence described above, DHS \nwould also take into consideration any additional medical records or related information provided by the alien to \nclarify any medical condition included on the medical form or other information that may outweigh any negative \nfactors. Such documentation may include, for instance, a licensed doctor's attestation of prognosis and treatment of \na medical condition.     The presence or absence of a medical condition would only be considered a positive or \nnegative factor as it pertains to the alien's likelihood of becoming a public charge; frequently, this would entail \nconsideration of whether, in light of the alien's health, the alien will be able to adequately care for him- or herself, to \nattend school, or to work.\\466\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\466\\ Relatedly, as part \nof the assets, resources and financial status factor, DHS would consider whether the alien either has sufficient \nhousehold assets and resources, including private health insurance, to cover any reasonably foreseeable medical \ncosts related to a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that \nwill interfere with the alien's ability to provide care for him- or herself, to attend school, or to work. ------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------  2. Potential Effects for Aliens With a Disability, Depending on Individual \nCircumstances     As noted above, DHS would consider any immigration medical examination submitted with the \nalien's application, as well as any other evidence demonstrating that the individual has a medical condition that will \naffect the alien's ability to work, attend school, or otherwise support himself or herself. As part of the immigration \nmedical examination, when identifying a Class B medical condition, civil surgeons and panel physicians are \nrequired to report on certain disabilities, including the nature and severity of the disability, its impact on the alien's \nability to work, attend school, or otherwise support himself or herself, and whether the disability will require \nhospitalization or institutionalization. Under the proposed rule, DHS would only consider disability as part of the \nhealth factor to the extent that such disability, in the context of the alien's individual circumstances, impacts the \nlikelihood of the alien becoming a public charge. Frequently, this would entail consideration of the potential effects \non the alien's ability to work, attend school or otherwise support him or herself.  [[Page 51184]]      The \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 \\467\\ and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 \\468\\ prohibit discrimination \nagainst individuals based on their disabilities.\\469\\ Both laws require, among other things, that employers provide \nreasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities who need them to apply for a job, perform a job's \nessential functions, or enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment, absent undue hardship (i.e., significant \ndifficulty or expense). The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) \\470\\ ensures equality of educational \nopportunity and assists States in providing special education and related services to children with disabilities. \nFurther, DHS is specifically prohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities and otherwise \npreventing individuals with disabilities from participating in benefits programs.\\471\\ Congress has noted that \n``[d]isability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to . . . \ncontribute to society; pursue meaningful careers; and enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, \nsocial, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society.'' \\472\\ Individuals with disabilities make \nsubstantial contributions to the American economy. For example, in 2010, 41.1 percent of people with disabilities \nbetween the ages of 21 to 64 were employed (27.5 percent of adults with severe disability and 71.2 percent of \nadults with non- severe disabilities were employed) during a study conducted by the CDC.\\473\\ The ADA,\\474\\ the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973,\\475\\ and the IDEA \\476\\ provide further protections for individuals with disabilities to \nbetter ensure that such individuals have the opportunity to make such contributions.\\477\\ -----------------------------------\n----------------------------------------      \\467\\ Public Law 93-112, section 504, 87 Stat. 355, 394 (codified as amended at \n29 U.S.C. 794) (prohibiting discrimination solely on the basis of disability in Federal and federally-funded programs \nand activities).     \\468\\ Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. 12101-12213).     \n\\469\\ See 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(5); see also 29 CFR 1630.2(o), 1630.9.     \\470\\ Public Law 108-446, 118 Stat 2647 \n(2004) (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. 1400-1482).     \\471\\ See 6 CFR 15.30(b)(1)(i) (``The Department, in \nproviding any aid, benefit, or service, may not directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on \nthe basis of disability . . .

G. Assets, Resources, and Financial Status      In addition to age, \nhealth, and family status, USCIS must consider an applicant's assets, resources, and financial status in making a \npublic charge determination.\\479\\ The statute does not define these terms, but the agency has historically \ninterpreted these terms to include information that would provide an overview of the alien's financial means and \noverall financial health. Since Legacy INS issued the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, the practical focus has been \nprimarily on the sufficiency of an Affidavit of Support submitted on the alien's behalf. However, given that the statute \nsets out the Affidavit of Support as a separate  [[Page 51187]]  requirement and the statute includes the mandatory \nreview of assets, resources and financial status as a factor,\\480\\ DHS is proposing to consider in the totality of the \ncircumstances whether the alien can, taking into account both the alien's assets and liabilities, establish the ability \nto support himself or herself and the household as defined in the proposed 8 CFR 212.21(d). ------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------      \\479\\ See INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4).     \\480\\ See INA \nsection 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      All else being \nequal, the more assets and resources an alien has, the more self-sufficient the alien is likely to be, and the less \nlikely the alien is to receive public benefits. On the other hand, an alien's lack of assets and resources, including \nincome, makes an alien more likely to receive public benefits. Whether a person may be qualified for public benefits \nfrequently depends on where the person's household income falls with respect to the FPG.\\481\\ Federal, State, and \nlocal public benefit granting agencies frequently use the FPG to determine eligibility for public benefits.\\482\\ Some \nmajor means-tested programs, however, rely on different income-related measurements for purposes of \ndetermining eligibility.\\483\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\481\\ The poverty \nguidelines are updated periodically in the Federal Register by HHS. The U.S. Census Bureau definition of family \nand family household can be found in U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey 2017 Annual Social and \nEconomic Supplement (ASEC) 9-1 to 9-2, available at            https://www2.census.gov/programs-\nsurveys/cps/techdocs/cpsmar17.pdf (last visited Sept. 13, 2018).     \\482\\ Different Federal programs use different \npercentages of the FPG such as 125 percent, 150 percent, or 185 percent. See U.S. Dep't of Health & Human \nServs., Office of the Assistant Sec'y for Planning & Evaluation, Frequently Asked Questions Related to the Poverty \nGuidelines and Poverty, What Programs Use the Federal Poverty Guidelines, available at            \n\napplicant has a household size of 4, where 125 percent of the FPG for that household size is $31,375. The \napplicant's household income is $24,000, which is $7,375 below 125 percent of the FPG for a household of 4. \nTherefore, in order to avoid DHS determining that the applicant's household income is a negative factor in the \ntotality of the circumstances, the alien would need $36,875 in household assets and resources.     An alien's \nfinancial status would also include the alien's liabilities as evidenced by the alien's credit report and score, as well \nas whether the alien has in the past, or is currently, receiving public benefits, among other considerations. Below, \nDHS describes the proposed rule's evidentiary requirements for this factor.     DHS welcomes public comments on \nwhether 125 percent of the FPG is an appropriate threshold in considering the alien's assets and resources or if \nthere are other potential alternatives, including any studies or data that would provide a basis for a different \nmeasure or threshold. 1. Evidence of Assets and Resources     DHS proposes that USCIS would consider certain \ntypes of evidence when reviewing this factor. USCIS consideration of an alien's assets and resources would \ninclude, but not be limited to, a review of such information as:      The alien's annual gross household income (i.e., \nall sources of income before deductions), excluding any income from public benefits;      Any additional income from \nindividuals not included in the alien's household as defined in the proposed 8 CFR 212.21(d) who physically reside \nwith the alien and whose income will be relied on by the alien to meet the proposed standard of household income \nat or above 125 percent of FPG;      Any additional income to the alien from another person or source not included \nin the alien's household on a continuing monthly or yearly basis for the most recent calendar year, excluding any \nincome from public benefits;      The household's cash assets and resources, including as reflected in checking and \nsavings account statements in the last 12 months;      The household's non-cash assets and resources that can be \nconverted into cash within 12 months, such as net cash value of real estate holdings minus the sum of all loans \nsecured by a mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the home; annuities; securities; retirement and educational \naccounts; and any other assets that can be converted into cash easily.     All of this information is potentially \nrelevant to a determination of the alien's assets and resources, and likelihood of becoming a public charge. 2. \nEvidence of Financial Status     When reviewing whether the alien has any financial liabilities or past reliance on \npublic benefits that make the alien more or less likely to become a public charge, DHS proposes to review the \nfollowing evidence:      Evidence that the alien has applied for or received any public benefit, as defined in the \nproposed 8 CFR 212.21(b), on or after the effective date of the final rule;      Been certified or approved to receive \npublic benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), on or after the effective date of the final rule;      Evidence that the \nalien has applied for or received a fee waiver for  [[Page 51188]]  immigration benefits after the effective date of \nthe final rule;      Credit histories and credit scores; and      Whether the alien has the private health insurance or the \nfinancial resources to pay for medical costs associated with a medical condition identified in 8 CFR 212.22(b)(2). (a) \nPublic Benefits     Current or past applications for or receipt of public benefits, as defined in the proposed 8 CFR \n212.21(b), suggests that the alien's overall financial status is so weak that he or she is or was unable to fully \nsupport him or herself without government assistance, i.e., that the alien will receive such benefits in the future. \nDHS, therefore, proposes to consider any current and past receipt of public benefits as set forth in 8 CFR 212.21(b) \nas a negative factor in the totality of the circumstances, because it is indicative of a weak financial status and \nincreases the likelihood that the alien will become a public charge in the future. The weight given to this factor \nwould depend on how recently the alien has received public benefits, and whether the person has received public \nbenefits for an extended period of time (i.e., receives public benefits for multiple years) or at multiple different time \nperiods (i.e., 3 times in the last two years).\\488\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\488\\ \nThis proposed policy is generally consistent with longstanding policy affording less weight to benefits that were \nreceived longer ago in the past. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS would also \nconsider whether the alien has been certified or approved to receive public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), \non or after the effective date of the final rule. For example, a person may be certified for SNAP benefits for a month \nor up to 24 months at one time and then receive the benefits from the EBT card on a monthly basis. In general, an \nalien who is certified or preapproved for benefits in the future is likely to continue to receive public benefits in the \nfuture. An alien nevertheless may otherwise establish that he or she has terminated the receipt of those benefits \nthrough documentation from the benefit-granting agency.     DHS recognizes that a person who previously received \npublic benefits may have changed circumstances and DHS would review those circumstances as part of the totality \nof the circumstances. For example, where an alien is currently unemployed and finishing a college education and \nreceived benefits, the alien may provide evidence that he or she has pending employment with benefits upon \ngraduation from college and attaining a degree. It is possible that in the review of the totality of the circumstances, \nthe alien would not be found likely to become a public charge.     Review of past applications for or receipt of public \n\n\n\nbenefits would include a review of both cash and non-cash public benefits as defined in the proposed 8 CFR \n212.21(b). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2012, approximately 52.2 million people in the United States (or \n21.3 percent of the overall population) participated in major means- tested government assistance programs each \nmonth.\\489\\ In addition, among those with family income below the poverty level \\490\\ an average of 61.3 percent \nparticipated in at least one major means tested benefit.\\491\\ Participation rates were highest for Medicaid (15.3 \npercent) and SNAP (13.4 percent).\\492\\ The largest share of participants (43.0 percent) who benefited from one or \nmore means-tested assistance programs between January 2009 and December 2012 stayed in the programs \nbetween 37 and 48 months.\\493\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\489\\ See Shelley K. \nIrving & Tracy A. Loveless, U.S. Census Bureau, Dynamics of Economic Well-Being: Participation in Government \nPrograms, 2009-2012: Who Gets Assistance? (May 2015), available at            \n\n\\499\\ See 8 CFR 103.7(d); see also 22 CFR 41.107(c) (listing categories of aliens exempt from nonimmigrant visa \nfees); 9 FAM 403.4-3 (same). Diplomats, UN visitors, U.S. Government employees, and those coming to perform \ncharitable work are typical classes of aliens whose nonimmigrant visa fees are exempted. ----------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------  (c) Credit Report and Score     As also noted above, DHS also proposes that \nUSCIS would consider an alien's liabilities and information of  [[Page 51189]]  such liabilities in a U.S. credit report \nand score as part of the financial status factor. Not everyone has a credit history in the United States. Nevertheless, \na good credit score in the United States is a positive factor that indicates a person is likely to be self- sufficient and \nsupport the household. Conversely, a lower credit score or negative credit history in the United States may indicate \nthat a person's financial status is weak and that he or she may not be self- sufficient. Credit reports contain \ninformation about a person's bill payment history, loans, current debt, and other financial information.\\500\\ Credit \nreports may also provide information about work and residences, lawsuits, arrests, and bankruptcies in the United \nStates.\\501\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\500\\ See USA.gov, Credit Reports and \nScores, available at            https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports (last updated Mar. 8, 2018).     \\501\\ See USA.gov, \nCredit Reports and Scores, available at            https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports (last updated Mar. 8, 2018). -------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------      A U.S. credit score is a number that rates a person's credit \nrisk at a point in time.\\502\\ It can help creditors determine whether to give the person credit, affect the terms of \ncredit the person is offered, or impact the rate the person will pay for a loan in the United States.\\503\\ U.S. banks \nand other entities use credit scoring to determine whether a person is likely to repay any loan or debt. A credit \nreport takes into account a person's bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts with overdue payments, \ncollection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of the accounts in the United States.\\504\\ Because credit reports \nand scores provide information on a person's financial status, DHS is proposing that USCIS would review any \navailable U.S. credit reports as part of its public charge inadmissibility determinations. USCIS would generally \nconsider a credit score characterized as ``good'' or better to be a positive factor as it demonstrates an applicant \nmay be able to support him or herself and any dependents assuming all other financial records are sufficient. A \n``good'' credit report is generally near or slightly above the average of U.S. consumers,\\505\\ and therefore the \nperson may be self-sufficient and less likely to become a public charge. A poor credit report is well below the \naverage of U.S. consumers.\\506\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\502\\ See USA.gov, \nCredit Reports and Scores, available at            https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports (last updated Mar. 8, 2018).     \n\\503\\ See USA.gov, Credit Reports and Scores, available at            https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports (last updated \nMar. 8, 2018).     \\504\\ See Fed.

The absence of an \nestablished U.S. credit history would not necessarily be a negative factor when evaluating public charge in the \ntotality of the circumstances. Absent a U.S. credit report or score, USCIS may give positive weight to an alien who \ncan show little to no debt and a history of paying bills timely. An alien may provide evidence of regular and timely \npayment of bills, and limited balances on credit cards and loans. In addition, USCIS would not consider any error on \na credit score that has been verified by the credit agency in determining whether an alien is likely to become a \npublic charge in the future. DHS welcomes comments on whether DHS should also consider credit scores that are \ncategorized less than ``good,'' the types of credit reports to be considered and the type of information from the \ncredit history that should be reviewed. (d) Financial Means To Pay for Medical Costs     DHS also proposes that \nUSCIS would consider evidence of whether an alien has the financial means for pay for certain reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs, including through private health insurance, as part of the financial factor for public \ncharge inadmissibility determinations.     Health insurance helps cover the cost of health care and being covered by \nhealth insurance programs, other than the ones included in the definition of public benefits under proposed 8 CFR \n212.21(b). Some aliens currently obtain health insurance with government funding.\\507\\ ------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------      \\507\\ See Jessica C.

GEMEnA developed working definitions that \ncategorize certification as a credential awarded by a non- governmental body, and involve successfully passing an \nexamination. A license is awarded by a government agency and provides legal authority to do a specific job. Both \ncertifications and licenses are time-limited, so must be renewed periodically. Educational certificates are awarded \nby an educational institution and need not be renewed.

Cooperation & Dev./European Union, Indicators of Immigrant Integration \n2015: Settling In (2015), available at            http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/Indicators-of-Immigrant-Integration-\n2015.pdf. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS may also consider an applicant's \nproficiency in other languages in addition to English, with appropriate consideration given to market demand, when \nreviewing the education and skills factor. 1. USCIS Evidentiary Requirements     DHS proposes that USCIS would \nconsider certain types of evidence when reviewing this factor. For the reasons expressed above, USCIS' review \nwould include, but not be limited to:      Evidence of the alien's recent history of employment;      The alien's \nacademic degree or certifications including a high school degree (or equivalent) or higher;      The alien's \noccupational skills, certifications, or licenses; and      The alien's proficiency in English or proficiencies in additional \nlanguages.  J. Prospective Immigration Status and Expected Period of Admission      DHS would also take into \nconsideration the immigration status and duration of admission sought by an alien, and the classification the alien \nis seeking, as part of this determination. The type of evidence generally required of an applicant for an immigrant \nvisa,  [[Page 51197]]  admission as an immigrant, or adjustment of status would generally differ in scope from the \nevidence required of a bona fide applicant seeking a nonimmigrant visa or admission as a nonimmigrant. For \nexample, an alien seeking permanent residence in the United States may be eligible for certain public benefits \nupon his or her entry as a permanent resident or after five years. As a result, there is a chance that he or she would \navail him or herself of the available public benefit. USCIS would consider this possibility in the totality of the \ncircumstances.     On the other hand, aliens who are coming to the United States temporarily as a nonimmigrant \nmay be less likely to avail themselves of public benefits, particularly if they are coming to the United States for a \nshort period of time or if they are coming to the United States for employment purposes. For example, an alien \ncoming to the United States on a nonimmigrant visitor (B-2) for a vacation in the United States for two weeks must \nestablish he or she has sufficient funds to cover any expenses in the United States. Therefore, generally, a \nnonimmigrant visitor would be unlikely to avail him or herself of any public benefits for which he or she would be \neligible based on being lawfully present in the United States. Therefore, such an alien, if otherwise entitled to a \nnonimmigrant visa and admission as a nonimmigrant, generally would not be subject to the public charge \ninadmissibility ground under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), although it is possible that evidence \nmay exist that gives rise to a public charge concern.  K. Affidavit of Support      Failure to submit a required affidavit \nof support when required under section 212(a)(4)(C) or section 212(a)(4)(D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C) or \n1182(a)(4)(D), necessarily results in a determination of inadmissibility based on the public charge ground without \nreview of any other statutory factors.\\529\\ For aliens who submit an affidavit of support, the statute allows DHS to \nconsider the affidavit of support under section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, in public charge inadmissibility \ndeterminations.\\530\\ DHS, therefore, proposes to consider any required affidavit of support \\531\\ as part of the \ntotality of the circumstances. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\529\\ Certain applicants \nare exempt from filing the affidavit of support under INA section 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a.     \\530\\ See INA section \n212(a)(4)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); see also proposed 8 CFR 212.22(b)(7).     \\531\\ See INA section \n212(a)(4)(C) and (a)(4)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C) and 1182(a)(4)(D). ------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------  1. General Consideration of Sponsorship and Affidavits of Support     DHS would consider a sponsor's \nfacially sufficient affidavit of support as a positive factor in the totality of the circumstances, but a sufficient affidavit \nof support alone would not result in a finding that an alien is unlikely at any time to become a public charge due the \nstatute's requirement to consider the mandatory factors. Moreover, DHS has concerns about relying on sponsors to \nensure that aliens will not become a public charge, as submitting a sufficient affidavit of support does not guarantee \nthat the alien will not receive public benefits in the future.     PRWORA and IIRIRA amended the INA by setting forth \nrequirements for submitting what would be an enforceable affidavit of support, i.e., current Form I-864.\\532\\ \nApproximately 1 month after PRWORA was enacted, Congress amended the public charge inadmissibility ground, \nthrough passage of IIRIRA, to require certain applicants for lawful permanent resident status to submit an affidavit \nof support in accordance with section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a.\\533\\ An Affidavit of Support under Section \n213A of the INA (Form I-864) \\534\\ is a contract between the sponsor and the U.S. Government that imposes on \nthe sponsor a legally enforceable obligation to support the alien. The sponsor generally must demonstrate that he \nor she is able to maintain the sponsored alien at an annual income of not less than 125 percent of the FPG.\\535\\ By \ncreating these requirements in section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, Congress intended to ensure that affidavits \nof support were enforceable and that public benefit-granting agencies could be reimbursed for certain aid provided \nto the sponsored alien.\\536\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\532\\ See INA sections \n212(a)(4) and 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4) and 1183a.     \\533\\ See IIRIRA, Public Law 104-208, div. C, section \n\nhttp://ftp.iza.org/dp7360.pdf\nhttp://www.oecd.org/els/mig/Indicators-of-Immigrant-Integration-2015.pdf\nhttp://www.oecd.org/els/mig/Indicators-of-Immigrant-Integration-2015.pdf\n\n\n531(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-675.     \\534\\ The Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, Form I-\n864EZ, may be used instead of Form I-864 in certain circumstances. References to the affidavit of support in this \nrule include Form I-864EZ.     \\535\\ See INA section 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a.     \\536\\ In explaining the provision, \nCongress continued to emphasize that the affidavits of support (before 1996) were previously unenforceable. \nCongress highlighted the difference between the situation at the time, before 1996, and the new law which would \nmake the affidavits enforceable and permit benefit- providing agencies to seek reimbursement. See H.R. Rep. No. \n104-651, at 1449 (1996). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      As part of PRWORA, benefit-\ngranting agencies assess the combined income and resources of the sponsor (and his or her spouse) and the alien \nto determine whether the combined income and resources meet the eligibility requirements.\\537\\ This is called \n``sponsor-to-alien deeming.'' Public benefits agencies, however, have encountered challenges obtaining information \nabout the sponsor's income when determining the alien's eligibility for public benefits. A U.S. Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) 2009 report found that although the number of sponsored noncitizens potentially \naffected by such deeming is unknown, most recent information then available suggested that 11 percent (473,000) \nof sponsored aliens in 2007 applied for TANF, Medicaid, or SNAP during the course of 2007, and less than one \npercent applied for SSI.\\538\\ In addition, according to a 2002 study of the New York and Los Angeles areas by the \nUrban Institute for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of HHS, individuals who have \nbecome lawful permanent residents since the affidavit of support under section 213A of the Act was enacted in \n1996 were poorer (with incomes below 100 percent of the FPL) than those who arrived earlier.\\539\\ ``Legal \nimmigrants who entered the country since 1996 are poorer than those who arrived earlier, despite new policies \nrequiring their sponsors to demonstrate incomes over 125 percent of the [FPL].'' \\540\\ The report also indicates that \nsome immigrant families with incomes below twice the poverty level \\541\\ received SNAP, TANF or Medicaid from \n1999-2000.\\542\\ For example, in Los Angeles 13 percent and in New York City 22 percent of noncitizen families  \n[[Page 51198]]  with income below twice the poverty level received food stamps (SNAP).\\543\\ ----------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------      \\537\\ See PRWORA, Public Law 104-193, section 423, 11 Stat. 2105, 2271-\n74.     \\538\\ See U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-09-375, Sponsored Noncitizens and Public Benefits (May \n2009), available at            https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-375.     \\539\\ See Randy Capps et al., How Are \nImmigrants Faring After Welfare Reform?

In order to assess the sponsor's likelihood of meeting his or her obligation to support the alien, \nDHS would look at how close of a relationship the sponsor has to the alien, as close family members would be \nmore likely to financially support the alien if necessary. DHS would also look at whether the sponsor lives with this \nalien, as this could be indicative of the sponsor's willingness to support the alien if needed. Additionally, DHS would \nlook at whether the sponsor has submitted affidavit of support with respect to other individuals, as this may be \nindicative of the sponsor's willingness or ability to financially support the alien.     To the extent that the initial \nevidence submitted by the sponsor is insufficient to make this determination, USCIS would request additional \ninformation from the sponsor or interview the sponsor to determine whether the sponsor is willing and able to \nsupport the alien on a long- term basis. The inability or unwillingness of the sponsor to financially support the alien \nmay be viewed as a negative factor in the totality of the circumstances. DHS expects that a sponsor's sufficient \naffidavit of support would not be an outcome-determinative factor in most cases; the presence of a sufficient \naffidavit of support does not eliminate the need to consider all of the mandatory factors in the totality of the \ncircumstances.\\547\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\547\\ However, the statute \nrequires a finding of inadmissibility on public charge grounds if the alien is required to submit an affidavit of support \nand fails to do so. INA section 212(a)(4)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(D). --------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------  L. Heavily Weighed Factors      DHS proposes a number of factors or factual circumstances that it has \ndetermined would generally weigh heavily in determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge in the \nfuture.\\548\\ The mere presence of any one enumerated circumstance would not, alone, be determinative. A heavily \nweighed factor could be outweighed by countervailing evidence in the totality of the circumstances. Other negative \nand positive factors, including factors not enumerated elsewhere in this rule, may also be weighed heavily in \nindividual determinations, as circumstances warrant. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\548\\ See proposed 8 CFR 212.22. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  1. Heavily Weighed \nNegative Factors     DHS proposes to consider certain factors listed below as heavily negative because these \nfactors are particularly indicative of a likelihood that the alien would become a public charge. (a) Lack of \nEmployability     As long as an alien is not a full-time student and is authorized to work, DHS proposes that the \nabsence of current employment, employment history, or reasonable prospect of future employment will be a heavily \nweighed negative factor.\\549\\ Self-sufficiency generally involves people being capable and willing to work and being \nable to maintain gainful employment. A person who is capable and able to work but does not work demonstrates a \nlack of self-sufficiency. As previously discussed, various studies and data support the concept that a person's \neducation and skills may be positive factors for purposes of evidencing self-sufficiency, including the SIPP data \nreviewed in the Education and Skills section, and the U.S. Census Bureau report that indicates that lower \neducational attainment is associated with higher public benefit program participation rates for people over the age \nof 18.\\550\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\549\\ See proposed 8 CFR 212.22(c)(1)(ii). \nWhile a full-time student must still demonstrate he or she is not likely to become a public charge, because the public \ncharge determination is based on the totality of the circumstances under the proposed 8 CFR 212.22(d) that \nincludes consideration of the alien's immigration status, the lack of employment or employment history is not \ncounted as a heavily weighed negative factor when making public charge determinations regarding full-time \nstudents. The full-time student is working toward a degree, which makes the student more employable in the future, \nand as such, has a reasonable prospect of employment in the future.     \\550\\ See Shelley K.

(e) Alien Previously Found Inadmissible or Deportable Based \non Public Charge     DHS is proposing to consider an alien previously found inadmissible or deportable based on \npublic charge grounds to be a high risk of becoming a public charge in the future.\\582\\ Absent countervailing \npositive factors and evidence to show that current  [[Page 51204]]  circumstances outweigh the conditions that \nsupported the finding of inadmissibility, the previous finding will carry heavy weight in determining that an alien is \nlikely to be a public charge again. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\582\\ See proposed \n8 CFR 212.22(c)(1)(v). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. Heavily Weighed Positive \nFactors     Significant income, assets, and resources play a major role in whether an individual is likely to become a \npublic charge. In addition, as described above, Tables 27 and 28 show a relationship between the FPG and welfare \nparticipation rates among both U.S. citizens and noncitizens in receipt of non-cash benefits in 2013. The \npercentage of people receiving these public benefits generally goes down as the income percentage increases. \nSpecifically, 52.0 percent of U.S. citizens living below 125 percent of the FPG received non-cash benefits compared \nto 42.4 percent of those living between 125 and 250 percent of the FPG, 36.9 percent of those living between 250 \nand 400 percent of the FPG, and 13.5 percent of those above 400 percent of the FPL. Noncitizen participation rates \nin non-cash benefit programs among those living below 125 percent of the FPG was about 40 percent, compared to \nabout 35 percent of those either between 125 and 250 percent of the FPG or 250 and 400 percent of the FPG.\\583\\ \nAmong noncitizens living above 400 percent of the FPG, the rate of receipt was 17.1 percent. Among U.S. citizens, \nthe rate of receipt of cash benefits among those living below 125 percent of the FPG was 12.9 percent, compared \nto a rate of 10.3 percent among those living between 125 and 250 percent of the FPG, 5.5 percent among those \nliving between 250 and 400 percent of the FPG, and 1.9 percent of those living above 400 percent of the FPG. \nAmong noncitizens, the rates of receipt were 6.7 percent among those living below 125 percent of the FPG, about 2 \nto 3 percent among those either living between 125 to 250 percent of the FPG or living between 250 to 400 percent \nof the FPG, and 1.1 percent among those living above 400 percent of the FPG. Because many public benefit \nprograms determine eligibility based on the FPG, individuals living above 250 percent of the FPG are less likely to \nreceive public benefits. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\583\\ The difference in rates \nbetween noncitizens living below 125 percent of the FPG and those living either between 125 and 250 percent of \nthe FPG, or 250 and 400 percent of the FPG, was not statistically significant. ---------------------------------------------------\n------------------------      For these reasons, and based on the data that follows, DHS proposes to consider it a heavily \nweighed positive factor if the alien has financial assets, resources, support, or annual income of at least 250 \npercent of the FPG in the totality of the circumstances.\\584\\ However, DHS notes that an alien with an annual \nincome of less than 250 percent of FPG would not automatically be inadmissible based on public charge. Instead, \nall the factors as discussed above would be considered in the totality of the circumstances, which may be favorable \nto be person regardless of whether the income is below 250 percent of the FPG. ----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------      \\584\\ Income between 125 and 250 percent of the FPL is considered a positive factor in \nthe public charge inadmissibility analysis.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page 51205]]  \n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.042   [[Page 51206]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.043  (f) \nPreviously Excluded Benefits     DHS would not consider public benefits under the proposed 8 CFR 212.21(b) that \nwere previously excluded under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance if received before effective date of the final rule. \nDHS, however, would continue to consider cash benefits for income maintenance SSI, TANF and benefits for long-\nterm institutionalization (i.e. those previously considered under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance) that an alien \nreceived before the effective date of the final rule.\\585\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\585\\ Under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, DHS would consider the current receipt of cash benefits for income \nmaintenance or long- term institutionalization at government expense in the totality of the circumstances. See Field \nGuidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689, 28690 (May 26, 1999) (``If \nat the time of application for admission or adjustment an alien is receiving a cash public assistance for income \nmaintenance or is institutionalized for long-term care (as discussed in section 6, below), that benefit should be \ntaken into account under the totality of the circumstances test, along with the other statutory factors under section \n212(a)(4)(B)(i) and any [adjustment of status].''). DHS would also consider past receipt of cash benefits for income \nmaintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense in the totality of the circumstances. See Field \nGuidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689, 28690 (May 26, 1999) \n(``[P]ast receipt of cash income-maintenance benefits does not automatically make an alien inadmissible as likely to \n\n\n\nbecome a public charge, nor does past institutionalization for long-term care at government expense. Rather this \nhistory would be one of many factors to be considered in applying the totality of the circumstances test.''). -------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------      Public benefits previously considered under the 1999 Interim \nField Guidance and received prior to the effective date of this rule would be considered as a negative factor in the \ntotality of the circumstances analysis when determining whether an alien is inadmissible as likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge. However, the  [[Page 51207]]  receipt of such benefits would not be considered as a \nheavily weighed negative factor.     Table 29 provides a summary of how benefits received prior to and after the \neffective date of this proposed rule would be considered under the proposed rule. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] \nTP10OC18.044  Examples     The following examples illustrate how DHS will consider benefits received prior to the \neffective date of the rule for the purposes of making public charge inadmissibility determinations.

The examples \nare not intended to represent actual possible outcomes, as each case is reviewed individually on its own merits. \nUnder the proposed rule, benefits received prior to the effective date of the rule would be excluded from \nconsideration unless such benefits would have been considered under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance.\\588\\ \nHowever, benefits received after the effective date of the rule would be considered to the extent that they are a \npublic benefit, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\586\\ \nSNAP benefits received after the effective date of the proposed rule will be valued as set forth in proposed 8 CFR \n212.24(a).     \\587\\ The 1999 Interim Field Guidance suggests that any past or current receipt of the type of public \nbenefits included for consideration will be included in the public charge inadmissibility determination. See Field \nGuidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689, 28690 (May 26, 1999) (``If \nat the time of application for admission or adjustment an alien is receiving a cash public assistance for income \nmaintenance or is institutionalized for long-term care (as discussed in section 6, below), that benefit should be \ntaken into account under the totality of the circumstances test, along with the other statutory factors under section \n212(a)(4)(B)(i) and any AOS . . . . Past receipt of cash income-maintenance benefits does not automatically make \nan alien inadmissible as likely to become a public charge, nor does past institutionalization for long-term care at \ngovernment expense. Rather this history would be one of many factors to be considered in applying the totality of \nthe circumstances test. In the case of an alien who has received cash income-maintenance benefits in the past or \nwho has been institutionalized for long-term care at government expense, a Service officer determining admissibility \nshould assess the totality of the alien's circumstances at the time of the application for admission or adjustment and \nmake a forward-looking determination regarding the likelihood that the alien will become a public charge after \nadmission or adjustment.'' (emphasis added)).     \\588\\ See proposed 8 CFR 212.21(c). -------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------      Example 1: Benefits Excluded Under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance     Example \n1 is based on the following scenario: The DHS rule on public charge inadmissibility under section 212(a)(4) of the \nAct, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), goes into effect on January 1, 2019. The alien is the only member of the household, has \nbeen paroled into the United States pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act for over five years, and is seeking to \nadjust status based on a visa category subject to public charge inadmissibility. The alien files the adjustment of \nstatus application on May 1, 2019, and the application is adjudicated on September 1, 2019. HHS published the \nnew FPG in early January 2019, which contains the same values as the 2018 FPG for purposes of this example. \nFor a household of 1, the FPG is $12,140. Fifteen percent of the FPG is $1,821 in a 12-month period. The alien is \ncertified to receive SNAP benefits for 36 months, beginning on January 1, 2018. For the consecutive 12-month \nperiod between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, the alien receives $2,160 in SNAP benefits. For the \nconsecutive twelve-month period between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, the alien receives $2,160 in \nSNAP benefits. The alien received no other public benefits. SNAP was previously excluded under the 1999 Interim \nField Guidance, but is included in proposed 8 CFR 212.21(b).     Under proposed 8 CFR 212.22(d), the SNAP \nbenefits the alien received before January 1, 2019, the effective date of the public charge rule, would not be \nconsidered. However, the SNAP benefits the alien received on or after January 1, 2019 would be considered if the \naggregate annual value of SNAP benefits received since the effective date of the rule exceeds $1,821 (fifteen \npercent of the FPG for the household of one within any period of consecutive twelve consecutive months). For the \nconsecutive twelve-month period between January 1, 2019 and September 1, 2019, the date of adjudication, the \nalien had only received a total of $1,620 in SNAP benefits, which is less than the threshold amount. However, \nbecause the alien is certified to receive $2,160 in SNAP benefits for a consecutive twelve-month period beginning \nafter the rule's effective date, and such amount exceeds fifteen percent of the FPG, these benefits would be \nconsidered as a heavily weighed negative factor in the totality of the circumstances, as illustrated in Table 30. In \n\n\n\nthis case, absent other evidence tending to show that the alien is unlikely to receive the benefits covered by the \ncertification, USCIS would probably find that the alien is likely to become a public charge and is ineligible for \nadjustment of status.\\589\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\589\\ Pursuant to proposed \n8 CFR 212.24(a), for SNAP benefits, DHS would calculate the value of the benefit attributable to the alien in \nproportion to the total number of people covered by the benefit, based on the amount(s) deposited as defined in \n212.21(b) which the benefits are received in the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card account.  -----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------  [[Page 51208]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.045      Example \n2: Benefits Excluded Under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance     Example 2 is based on the following scenario: The \nDHS rule on public charge inadmissibility under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), goes into effect \non January 1, 2019. An alien is the only member of the household, has been paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) \nof the Act for over five years, and is seeking to adjust status based on a visa category subject to a public charge \ninadmissibility determination. The alien files the adjustment of status application on May 1, 2020, and the \napplication is adjudicated on September 1, 2020. HHS publishes the calendar year 2019 FPG in early January 2019 \nand the 2020 FPG in early January 2020. For the purposes of this example, the FPG for 2019 and 2020 contains \nthe same values as the FPG for 2018, which is $12,140. Fifteen percent of the FPG for 2018, 2019 and 2020 would \nbe $1,821 in the relevant consecutive 12-month periods for this example .The alien was certified to receive SNAP \nfor 36 months beginning in January 2018. The alien received no other public benefits. For the consecutive twelve-\nmonth period between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, the alien received $2,160 in SNAP benefits. For \nthe consecutive twelve-month period between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, the alien received $2,160 \nin SNAP benefits. Beginning on January 1, 2020, however, the alien no longer receives any SNAP benefits. The \nalien provided a benefits termination letter as evidence along with the alien's adjustment application.     Under \nproposed 8 CFR 212.22(d), the SNAP benefits the alien received before January 1, 2019, the effective date of the \npublic charge rule, would not be considered. However, the SNAP benefits the alien received on or after January 1, \n2019 would be considered if the aggregate annual value of SNAP benefits received since the effective date of the \nrule exceeds $1,821 (fifteen percent of the FPG for the household of one within any period of consecutive twelve \nconsecutive months). For the consecutive twelve-month period between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, \nthe SNAP benefits the alien received exceeded the fifteen percent threshold, and therefore would be considered. \nBecause the receipt was within the 36 months immediately preceding the application, it is a heavily weighed factor \nin the totality of the circumstances. The termination letter suggests, however, that the alien is unlikely to receive \nfuture public benefits. DHS would weigh the termination letter along with the other evidence, in the totality of the \ncircumstances. The preceding analysis is summarized in Table 31.\\590\\ ---------------------------------------------------------\n------------------      \\590\\ Pursuant to proposed 8 CFR 212.24(a), for SNAP benefits, DHS would calculate the value of \nthe benefit attributable to the alien in proportion to the total number of people covered by the benefit, based on the \namount(s) deposited as defined in 212.21(b) which the benefits are received in the Electronic Benefits Transfer \n(EBT) card account.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page 51209]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF \nOMITTED] TP10OC18.046      Example 3: Benefits Previously Excluded and Included Under the 1999 Interim Field \nGuidance     The example is based on the following scenario: The DHS rule on public charge inadmissibility under \nsection 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), goes into effect on January 1, 2019. An alien has been paroled \ninto the United States pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act for over five year and is seeking to adjust status \nbased on a visa category subject to the public charge inadmissibility determination. The alien's household of three \nincludes the alien and the alien's two U.S. citizen children. The alien files an adjustment of status application on \nMay 1, 2019, and the application is adjudicated on September 1, 2019. HHS publishes the calendar year 2019 FPG \nin early January 2019. For the purposes of this example, the FPG for 2019 contains the same values as the FPG \nfor 2018. The relevant FPG based on a household of one in a consecutive twelve- month period is $12,140. Fifteen \npercent of the average FPG for the consecutive twelve-month period between January 1, 2018 and FPG for \nDecember 31, 2018 is $1,821. Fifteen percent of the average FPG for the consecutive twelve-month period \nbetween January 1, 2019 and FPG for December 31, 2019 is also $1,821.     For the consecutive twelve-month \nperiod between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, the alien's household of 3 receives $2,400 in SNAP \nbenefits. The proportional value of the $2,4000 SNAP benefit attributable to the alien based on her household size \nof 3 for this consecutive twelve-month period would be $800, or one third of $2,400. Similarly, for the consecutive \ntwelve-month period between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, the alien's household is certified to \nreceives $1,800 in SNAP benefits for the a household size of 3.     The alien is also receiving TANF. For the \nconsecutive twelve- month period between January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2018, the alien also receives a \n\n\n\nproportionate share of $100 per month in TANF benefits or $1,200 for the twelve-month period. The alien is certified \nto continue to receive TANF at this level through December 2019, and there is no evidence that the alien has \nterminated receipt.     Under proposed 8 CFR 212.22(d), the SNAP benefits the alien received before January 1, \n2019, the effective date of the public charge rule, would not be considered. However, the SNAP benefits the alien \nreceived on or after January 1, 2019 would be considered if the cumulative value of all monetizable benefits \nreceived exceeded $1,821. TANF was considered under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance and therefore, the total \nvalue of the benefit received prior January 1, 2019 would be considered as a negative factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances.\\591\\ TANF benefits received after January 1, 2019 would be considered if the total value of the \nalien's receipt of one or more public benefits exceeded $1,821 during the relevant consecutive twelve-month period. \nAt the time the alien's application was adjudicated on September 1, 2019, the alien received $600 in proportional \nSNAP benefits and $900 in TANF benefits during the consecutive 12-month period between January 1, 2019 and \nSeptember 1, 2019, which, cumulatively, is less than 15 percent of the FPG in the amount of $1,821. Therefore, the \nalien's receipt of SNAP and TANF in 2019 would not be considered past receipt of public benefits within the 36-\nmonth period immediately preceding the application. However, because the alien was certified to receive both \nSNAP and TANF for the entire consecutive twelve-month period between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 \nin a cumulative amount that exceeds the fifteen percent threshold, this would be a heavily weighed factor in the \ntotality of the circumstances, as illustrated in Table 32. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\591\\ Note that considering the past receipt of previously included benefits as a negative factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances is consistent with how such benefits were treated under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, under \nwhich an ``officer determining admissibility should assess the totality of the alien's circumstances at the time of the \napplication for admission or adjustment . . . The longer ago an alien received such cash benefits or was \ninstitutionalized, the less weight these factors will have as a predictor of future receipt. Also, the `length of time an \napplicant has received public cash assistance is a significant factor.' The longer an alien has received cash income-\nmaintenance benefits in the past and the greater the amount of benefits, the stronger the implication that the alien is \nlikely to become a public charge. The negative implication of past receipt of such benefits or past institutionalization \n[sic], however, may be overcome by positive factors in the alien's case demonstrating an ability to be self-\nsupporting.'' Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689, 28690 \n(May 26, 1999).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page 51210]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF \nOMITTED] TP10OC18.047      DHS notes that the proposed exclusion of certain benefits received before the \neffective date may provide an opportunity for public benefit granting agencies to communicate the consequences of \nreceiving public benefits, to the extent such agencies deem appropriate. In addition, the proposed exclusion \nprovides advance notice to aliens that DHS is considering to change which public benefits it will consider for \npurposes of public charge inadmissibility determinations. If finalized, this provision, coupled with the proposed 60-\nday effective date, would give aliens an opportunity to stop receiving public benefits and obtain other means of \nsupport before filing for immigration benefits.     DHS welcomes comment on whether DHS should consider receipt \nof public benefits previously considered under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance as described in Table 29 at all, or if \nDHS should consider the benefit(s) in some other way than as a negative factor in the totality of the circumstances.  \nM. Summary of Review of Factors in the Totality of the Circumstances      An alien's likelihood of becoming a public \ncharge, as discussed above, is prospective and based on the totality of the alien's circumstances. The Form I-944, \nDeclaration of Self-Sufficiency, would be used by DHS to assess whether the alien is likely to become a public \ncharge based on the totality of the circumstances. Table 33 below, provides a brief summary of the totality of the \ncircumstances framework for public charge inadmissibility determinations. \\592\\ -----------------------------------------------\n----------------------------      \\592\\ The family status factor consideration entails determining the alien's household size \nand whether the alien has his or her own household or is a part of another individual's household. Among \nnoncitizens in families with 3 or 4 people, about 20 percent received non-cash assistance, while about 30 percent of \nnoncitizens in families of 5 or more received non-cash benefits.  --------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------  [[Page 51211]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.048   [[Page 51212]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] \nTP10OC18.049   [[Page 51213]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.050   [[Page 51214]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF \nOMITTED] TP10OC18.051   [[Page 51215]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.052      Below, DHS \nprovides examples of potential public charge inadmissibility determinations. These examples are for illustrative \npurposes only and assume a closed universe of facts for purposes of simplicity. The examples are not intended to \nrepresent actual possible outcomes, as each case is reviewed individually on its own merits. ------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------      \\593\\ A sponsor must be able to demonstrate the means to maintain an \n\n\n\nincome of at least 125 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for the sponsor's household size. See INA section \n213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a. For aliens who are subject to the sponsor requirements, if a sponsor is not able to have a \nsufficient affidavit of support, the alien is inadmissible based on public charge under INA sections 212(a)(4) and \n213A, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4) and 1183a.     \\594\\ Except that the absence of a sufficient affidavit of support, where \nrequired, will lead to an inadmissibility finding. See INA 212(a)(4)(C), (D), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C), (D). ------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------  1. Favorable Determination of Admissibility     The following is an \nexample (Table 34) of a set of facts that would likely result in a favorable determination of admissibility for public \ncharge purposes. An alien would need to meet all other admissibility and eligibility requirements of the immigration \nbenefit the alien is seeking.  [[Page 51216]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.053  2. Unfavorable \nDetermination of Admissibility     The following is an example (Table 35) of a set of facts that would likely result in \nan unfavorable determination of admissibility for public charge purposes. The alien may also be subject to other \ninadmissibility grounds.  [[Page 51217]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.054   [[Page 51218]]   \n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.055  N. Valuation of Monetizable Benefits      DHS has consulted with the \nrelevant Federal agencies regarding the inclusion and consideration of certain monetizable public benefits, and is \nproposing a benefit-specific methodology to establish a value for certain monetizable benefits in order to determine \nwhether the alien has received in excess of the 15 percent threshold. This methodology ensures that for benefits \nwhich are provided on the basis of a household and not the individual, USCIS would only take into consideration the \nportion of the benefit that is attributable to the alien. However, in circumstances where the alien is not eligible for a \ngiven benefit but is part of a household that receives the benefit (such as by living in a household that receives a \nhousing benefit by virtue of other household members' eligibility), such benefit based on the eligibility and receipt of \nsuch benefit(s) by his/her household members, USCIS would not consider such use for purpose of a public charge \ninadmissibility determination.     In valuing the cash monetizable benefits, USCIS would calculate the amount of the \nbenefit attributable to the alien in proportion to the other household members. Thus, for instance, a household cash \nbenefit of $600, shared among three eligible individuals, would be attributed to the alien in the amount of $200.     In \nvaluing the non-cash monetizable benefits, DHS would use the same methodology, as follows:      With respect to \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or formerly called ``Food Stamps''), 7 U.S.C. 2011 to \n2036c, DHS would calculate the annual aggregate amount of the benefit attributable to the alien alone, based on \nthe amount(s) deposited monthly in the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card account. This calculation would be \nperformed based on the alien's reporting of the monthly amounts deposited. DHS would divide the amount received \nby the number of eligible household members enrolled in the benefit.      With respect to the Section 8 Housing \nAssistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, as administered by HUD under 24 CFR part 984; 42 \nU.S.C. 1437f and 1437u, DHS would calculate the proportional value of the voucher attributable to the eligible alien \nalone, based on the amount of the benefit received. In calculating the proportional value of the benefit, DHS would \nuse the same methodology-- it would divide the value of the benefit by the number of people receiving it. DHS also \nwelcomes comments on a potential alternative methodology, under which DHS would assign value to the benefit \nusing HUD rules at 24 CFR 5.520.      With respect to Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including \nModerate Rehabilitation) under 24 CFR parts 5, 402, 880-884 and 886, DHS would calculate the proportional value \nof the rental assistance attributable to the eligible alien alone, based on the amount of the benefit received. In \ncalculating the proportional value of the benefit, DHS would use the same methodology as above--it would divide \nthe value of the benefit by the number of people receiving it. DHS also welcomes comment on a potential \nalternative methodology, under which DHS would assign value to the benefit using HUD rules at 24 CFR 5.520.     \nDHS seeks public comments on these proposed approaches described above, including any studies or data that \nwould support an alternative approach.  O. Public Charge Bond for Adjustment of Status Applicants      DHS has the \nbroad authority to prescribe forms of bonds as is deemed necessary for carrying out the Secretary's authority under \nthe provisions of the Act.\\595\\ Additionally, an alien who DHS has determined to be inadmissible based on public \ncharge grounds may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted at the discretion of the Secretary upon giving a suitable \nand proper bond.\\596\\ Currently, the regulatory authority for posting a public charge bond can be found in 8 CFR \n103.6 and 8 CFR 213.1. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\595\\ See INA section \n103(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(3).     \\596\\ See INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183. ---------------------------------------------------\n------------------------  1. Overview of Immigration Bonds Generally     Immigration bonds may generally be secured \nby cash or cash equivalents, or may be underwritten by a surety company certified by the Department of Treasury \nunder 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308.\\597\\ A bond, including a surety bond, is a contract between the United States (the \nobligee) and an individual or a company (obligor) who pledges a sum of money to guarantee a set of conditions set \n\n\n\nby the government concerning an alien.\\598\\ Surety bonds are bonds in which the surety company and its agents \nserve as co-obligors on the bond. Such company and its agents are jointly and severally liable for the payment of \nthe face amount of the bond if the bond is breached.\\599\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\597\\ See generally 8 CFR 103.6.     \\598\\ See, e.g., Matter of Allied Fid. Ins. Co., 19 I&N Dec. 124, 125-26 (BIA \n1984) (discussing the contractual nature of delivery bonds submitted under 8 CFR 103.6); see Merriam-Webster \nOnline Dictionary, Definition of Bond,            https://www.merriam-webster.com /dictionary/bond (last updated Sept. \n3, 2018).     \\599\\ See 8 CFR 103.6(e). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. Overview of \nPublic Charge Bonds (a) Public Charge Bonds     Public charge bonds are intended to hold the United States and \nall states, territories, counties, towns, municipalities and districts harmless against aliens becoming a public \ncharge.\\600\\ A public charge bond is issued on the condition that the alien does not become a public charge. If the \ngovernment permits the alien to submit a public charge bond, the government  [[Page 51219]]  admits the alien \ndespite having found the alien inadmissible as likely to become a public charge. -----------------------------------------------\n----------------------------      \\600\\ See INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183. ---------------------------------------------------------------\n------------      If an alien admitted after submitting a public charge bond becomes a public charge, the bond is \nbreached. The bond is breached regardless of whether a demand for payment of the public expense has been \nmade otherwise, as reflected below.\\601\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\601\\ See \nINA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183; see also Matter of Viado, 19 I&N Dec. 252, 253-54 (BIA 1985). --------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------  (b) Current and Past Public Charge Bond Procedures     Regulations \ngoverning public charge bonds can be found at 8 CFR 103.6 and 8 CFR 213.1. Agency guidance is provided in the \nAdjudicator's Field Manual (AFM), Chapter 61.1. According to the AFM, although DHS has the authority to require \npublic charge bonds, the authority has rarely been exercised since the passage of IIRIRA in 1996, which codified \nthe affidavit of support requirements.\\602\\ Consequently, USCIS does not currently have a process in place to \nregularly accept public charge bonds. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\602\\ See AFM, \nChapter 61.1 (``(b) Policy. Although USCIS has the authority to require a public charge bond, such authority is \nrarely exercised in light of the statutory changes contained in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) which created the enforceable affidavit of support (see Chapter 20.5 of this field \nmanual).'' IIRIRA section 564(f) amended INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183. In addition to the regular bonding \nrequirements, IIRIRA section 564(a) through (e) also established 3- year pilot programs in 5 district offices of INS to \nrequire aliens to post a bond in addition to the affidavit requirements under INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, and \nthe deeming requirements under section 421 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \nAct of 1996, 8 U.S.C. 1631. Congress provided that any pilot program established pursuant to this subsection shall \nrequire an alien to post a bond in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of benefits described in INA section \n213A(d)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1183a, and for the alien and the alien's dependents, and shall remain in effect until the \ndeparture, naturalization, or death of the alien. See IIRIRA, Public Law 104-208, div. C, section 564(a), 110 Stat \n3009-546, 3009-683. Suit on that bond was supposed to be brought under the terms and conditions of INA section \n213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a. Within 180 days after the date of IIRIRA, which was on September 30, 1996, the Attorney \nGeneral was directed to issue regulations establishing the pilot program, including criteria and procedures for \ncertification of bonding companies, debarment of any such company that fails to pay a bond, and criteria for setting \nthe amount of the bond to assure that the bond is in an amount that is not less than the cost of providing benefits \nunder INA section 213A(d)(2)(B) for the alien and the alien's dependents for 6 months. See IIRIRA, Public Law 104-\n208, div. C, section 564(b), 110 Stat 3009-546, 3009-683 to -684. Congress furthermore imposed an annual \nreporting requirement, starting 9 months after the date of the implementation of the program. See IIRIRA, Public \nLaw 104-208, div. C, section 564(d), 110 Stat 3009-546, 3009-684. DHS is unable to locate implementing materials \nrelating to this pilot program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Prior to 1996, INS had \nissued public charge bond guidance in the Operating Instructions (OI) 103.6 and 213.1,\\603\\ and its predecessor, \nthe Examinations Handbook, at Part VI, VI-88 through VI-98.\\604\\ Although these manuals do not appear to \ncomprehensively address public charge bonds, the following summarizes parameters of past public charge bond \npractices: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\603\\ See INS Operating Instructions (Nov. \n1997) [hereinafter OI]. INS removed Operating Instructions in 1998 and transferred the parts relating to the bond to \nthe Inspector's Field Manual, Chapter 45.

Without such a letter, INS would not accept the \nposting of a bond.\\605\\ INS informed the DOS of the posting of the bond as soon as an alien-designated obligor in \nthe United States posted the bond.\\606\\ According to 8 CFR 213.1, a public charge bond had to be at least $1,000. \nAs soon as a bond was posted, INS monitored the bond periodically.\\607\\ Any interested party could request the \nreview and cancellation of the bond at any time.\\608\\ Upon receiving the request, INS would notify the alien of his \nor her opportunity to present evidence to establish that the bond was not breached and that the alien was not likely \nto become a public charge in the future; receipt of public assistance was ordinarily sufficient to warrant the \ncontinuation of the bond.\\609\\ According to the OIs, if no request to cancel the bond was made, INS would review \nthe bond every 5 years to determine whether INS should cancel the bond. Ordinarily, and in addition to the statutory \nreasons for cancellation, a bond was cancelled after the initial 5- year period (or earlier, if warranted) if the review \nshowed that the alien had not and would not likely become a public charge.\\610\\ Additionally, and in accordance \nwith 8 CFR 103.6(c)(1), the bond could be cancelled if INS determined that there is no likelihood that the alien \nwould become a public charge.\\611\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\605\\ See \nExaminations Handbook, Part VI, at VI-89; see OI 213.1.     \\606\\ See Examinations Handbook, Part VI, at VI-89; \nsee OI 213.1.     \\607\\ See Examinations Handbook, Part VI, at VI-91 and VI-92; see OI 103.6(c)(1).     \\608\\ See \nExaminations Handbook, Part VI, at VI-94; see OI 103.6(c)(1).     \\609\\ See Examinations Handbook, Part VI, at VI-\n94; see OI 103.6(c)(1).     \\610\\ See Examinations Handbook, Part VI, at VI-94; see OI 103.6(c)(1).     \\611\\ See \nExaminations Handbook, Part VI, at VI-94; see OI 103.6(c)(1). ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----      If the alien became a public charge by using public assistance, the bond was breached in the necessary \namount with any remainder continued in effect.\\612\\ According to the Examinations Handbook, if the alien had \nreceived any public funds, and the agency from which the alien had obtained the funds requested repayment, the \nobligor was required to pay the actual expenses to INS within thirty days.

As already mentioned, USCIS' bond authority is rarely exercised in light of the \nstatutory changes contained in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) \nwhich created the enforceable affidavit of support. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nAlthough the current bond form used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Immigration Bond \n(Form I-352), references public charge bonds, ICE does not administer public charge bonds. However, Form I-352 \ndoes specify that the obligor shall pay to the United States or to any State, territory, county, town, municipality or \ndistrict that provided public assistance any and all charges up to the total amount of the bond. In the event that the \npublic authority providing assistance is not authorized to accept reimbursement, the obligor agrees that he or she \nwill pay DHS.  [[Page 51220]]  (c) Relationship of the Public Charge Bond to the Affidavit of Support     The Affidavit \nof Support and the public charge bond are distinct, but complementary, means to recover costs associated with the \nalien's receipt of public benefits. As discussed above, certain applicants seeking immigrant status must submit an \nenforceable Affidavit of Support under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864).\\616\\ The affidavit of support is a \ncontract between the alien's sponsor and the U.S. Government that imposes on the sponsor a legally enforceable \nobligation to support the alien. The obligation may be enforced against the sponsor by the sponsored alien, the \nFederal Government, any State or any political subdivision thereof, or by any other entity that provides any means-\ntested public benefit.\\617\\ According to section 213A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a(b), a non-governmental entity \nthat provided such benefit(s) or the appropriate entity of the Federal Government, a State, or any political \nsubdivision of the State must request reimbursement by the sponsor in the amount of the unreimbursed costs of the \nbenefits or, after non-payment, bring an action against the sponsor under section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183A, \nno later than 10 years after the date on which the sponsored alien last received any means- tested benefit to which \n\n\n\nthe affidavit of support applies.\\618\\ Section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, does not require a sponsored \nimmigrant to request the sponsor or joint sponsor to comply with the support obligation before bringing an action to \ncompel compliance.\\619\\ Neither USCIS nor DHS are directly involved in enforcing an Affidavit of Support \nsponsor's obligation to reimburse an agency. USCIS does, however, make information about the sponsor available \nto an agency seeking reimbursement.\\620\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\616\\ See \nINA section 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a.     \\617\\ See INA section 213A(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1183a(a)(1)(B).     \\618\\ See \nINA section 213A(b), 8 U.S.C. 1183A(b). Implementing regulations on the request for reimbursement and actions to \ncompel reimbursement can be found at 8 CFR 213a.4. Remedies available to enforce an affidavit of support under \nthis section include any or all of the remedies described in 28 U.S.C. 3201 (Judgement liens), 28 U.S.C. 3203 \n(Execution), 28 U.S.C. 3204 (Installment payment order), or 28 U.S.C. 3205 (Garnishment), as well as an order for \nspecific performance and payment of legal fees and other costs of collection and include corresponding remedies \navailable under State law. See INA section 213A(c), 8 U.S.C. 1183a(c). A Federal agency may seek to collect \namounts owed under this section in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37 \n(Claims of the United States Government). See INA section 213A(c), 8 U.S.C. 1183a(c).     \\619\\ See 8 CFR \n213a.4(a)(2).     \\620\\ See 8 CFR 213a.4(a)(3). Upon receipt of a duly issued subpoena, USCIS will provide the \nagency with a certified copy of a sponsor's Form I-864. Additionally, USCIS routinely provides the sponsor's name, \naddress and Social Security number to Federal, state, and local agencies providing means-tested benefits. -----------\n----------------------------------------------------------------      Under section 213 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183, an alien may be \nadmitted to the United States at the discretion of the Attorney General upon the giving of a suitable and proper \nbond. In contrast to the affidavit of support, which is a contract between the government and the sponsor, a bond, \nincluding a surety bond, is a contract between the United States (the obligee) and an individual or a company \n(obligor) who pledges a sum of money to guarantee conditions set by the government concerning an alien.\\621\\ \nThus, there are distinct differences between the affidavit of support and the bond. For example, unlike the affidavit \nof support, in which the alien as well as the government entity may have a cause of action to recover expenses, \nonly the government entity being part of the bond contract may pursue recovery from the obligor if the bond is \nbreached and only the obligor may challenge the breach determination.\\622\\ ---------------------------------------------------\n------------------------      \\621\\ See, e.g., Matter of Allied Fid. Ins. Co., 19 I&N Dec. 124, 125-26 (BIA 1984).     \\622\\ \nCompare INA section 213A(b)(2), 8 U.S.C. 1183a, with INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183. See also Matter of Ins. Co. \nof N. Am., 17 I&N Dec. 251, 251 (BIA 1978) (finding that only the obligor and the obligee are party to the contract \nand that only the obligor, but not the alien, may challenge the government breach determination). ------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------      In section 213 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183, Congress directly addresses the \naffidavit of support and the deeming requirement imposed in section 213 of the Act when it added a parenthetical to \nthe public charge bond provision stating that the alien may be admitted ``(subject to the affidavit of support \nrequirement and attribution of sponsor's income and resources under Section 213A)'' upon having posted a suitable \nbond.\\623\\ In the provision amending section 213 of the Act, section 564(f) of IIRIRA, Congress emphasized that \nthe bond was to be considered in addition to the sponsor and deeming requirements under section 213A of the Act, \n8 U.S.C. 1183A, and not instead of them.\\624\\ The Joint Explanatory Statement in the House Conference Report \nfor IIRIRA confirms that Congress intended that bonds ``should be required in addition to, and not in lieu of, the new \nsponsorship and deeming requirements of section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183a.'' \\625\\ Correspondingly, \nCongress also retained in section 213 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183, the longstanding concept that suit on the bond \nmay be made irrespective of the reasons for the breach and irrespective of whether a demand for payment of public \nexpenses have been made.\\626\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\623\\ See IIRIRA, \nPublic Law 104-208, div.

Additionally, as reflected below, DHS proposes to establish a new minimum bond amount of \n$10,000 (adjusted annually for inflation), explain the circumstances under which a public charge bond will be \ncancelled, as well as establish specific conditions under which a public charge bond will be breached.\\627\\ Finally, \nDHS proposes processing fees for the initial submission of the Public Charge Bond (Form I-945) and for the \nRequest for Cancellation of Public Charge Bond (Form I-356); both fees would be initially set at $25. USCIS plans \nto establish a process to accept and process public charge bonds, which would be available on the effective date of \nthe final rule. DHS welcomes comments on any aspect of the public charge bond or public charge bond process, \nincluding whether the minimum public charge bond amount should be higher or lower, and possible ranges for that \namount. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\627\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. ----------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------  3. Permission To Post a Public Charge Bond     First, the proposed \nregulation clarifies that permitting an alien who is found inadmissible as a public charge but is otherwise admissible \nto submit a public charge bond is within DHS's discretion.\\628\\ Section 213 of the Act gives DHS discretion to allow \nan alien  [[Page 51221]]  to post a ``suitable and proper'' public charge bond if the alien is otherwise admissible. \nTherefore, DHS proposes that in circumstances under which USCIS determines, after a finding of inadmissibility on \nthe public charge ground that a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted, USCIS will notify the alien of the \npossibility to submit a bond and USCIS will specify the bond amount and bond conditions. The alien would then be \npermitted to submit the appropriate form for the public charge bond in accordance with the form instructions and \nwith the appropriate fee. DHS proposes that a public charge bond could only be submitted on the alien's behalf \nafter USCIS makes this option available to the alien, and that USCIS would reject any unsolicited attempt to submit \na bond. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\628\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. -----------------\n----------------------------------------------------------      The same factors that weighed positively when making the public \ncharge inadmissibility determinations will generally indicate that offering the option of a public charge bond to an \nalien is warranted. Ultimately, the purpose of the public charge bond is to allow DHS to admit an alien who is \ninadmissible as likely to become a public charge, but who warrants a favorable exercise of discretion. DHS believes \nthat offering a public charge bond in the adjustment of status context would generally only be warranted in limited \ncircumstances in which the alien has no heavily weighed negative factors, but the presence of such factors would \nnot automatically preclude DHS from offering a public charge bond. As explained above, DHS would consider the \nheavily weighed negative factors particularly indicative of the likelihood that an alien would become a public charge. \nHowever, as is the case with any discretionary determination, DHS may also consider any of a range of positive \nand negative factors applicable to the alien's case when determining whether the alien should be offered the option \nto post a public charge bond and be admitted to the United States on bond. For example, an officer could consider \nwhether allowing the alien to become a lawful permanent resident would offer benefits to national security, or would \nbe justified for exceptional humanitarian reasons. Another example in which USCIS may offer an alien the \npossibility to post a bond would be if an alien had a weak financial status, had received public benefits 40 months \nprior to applying for immigration status, and had a medical condition, but the alien's prospect of obtaining medical \ninsurance (that does not meet the definition of a public benefit under proposed 8 CFR 212.21(b)) is good and the \ngrant of admission upon public bond would be in the interest of family unity. 4. Bond Amount and Submission of a \nPublic Charge Bond     DHS proposes that, in cases in which USCIS has determined that offering a public charge \nbond to an alien is warranted, the public charge bond be set at no less than $10,000, annually adjusted for inflation \nbased on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U),\\629\\ and rounded up to the nearest dollar. \nThis would raise the amount that is currently stated in 8 CFR 213.1 from no less than $1,000 to no less than \n$10,000. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\629\\ U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers,            https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?cu (select ``U.S. All \nitems, 1982-84=100--CUUR0000SA0'') (last visited Sept. 5, 2018). ----------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------      Proposing a base amount sufficient for a public charge bond based on historical public benefit data is \ndifficult, because the amount of average public benefit being considered under the proposed rule depends on the \npublic benefit the person receives and how long the person receives the benefit. The broad range of public benefits \navailable to individuals on the Federal, State, and local level, but not necessarily to immigrants, renders such a \ndetermination even more complex.     As indicated above, DHS proposes to set the base amount of the public \ncharge bond at $10,000. The current 8 CFR 213.1 refers to a bond amount of at least $1,000. 8 CFR 213.1 was \npromulgated in July of 1964.\\630\\ This provision has not been updated and inflation has never been accounted to \nrepresent present dollar values. Simply adjusting the amount for inflation using CPI-U would bring the bond floor in \n\n\nJune 2018 to about $8,100.\\631\\ DHS notes that bond amounts could be $1,000 or more (in 1964 dollars) and once \nadjusted for inflation, these amounts are equivalent to $8,100 or more in present dollar values. Additionally, when \nexamining previous public charge bonds granted by legacy immigration agencies, DHS has found that the \nminimum amount of approved public charge bonds remained relatively stable in inflation- adjusted dollars and \nfluctuated around or above $10,000.\\632\\ Accordingly, DHS proposes that $10,000 would be an amount that would \nprovide USCIS with an appropriate starting point when determining the public charge bond amount that is minimally \nnecessary to ensure that United States can recoup cost of public benefits received by the alien. Additionally, as with \ndetermining whether to offer an alien the option of posting a public charge bond, USCIS will consider the alien's \nindividual circumstances when determining the exact amount of the bond the alien is required to post. ------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------      \\630\\ Miscellaneous Amendments to Chapter, 29 FR 10579 (July 30, \n1964).     \\631\\ DHS uses the semi-annual average for the first half of 2018 and the annual average from 1964 from \nthe historical CPI-U for U.S. City Average, All Items. See            https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/supplemental-\nfiles/historical-cpi-u-201806.pdf.     Calculation: Annual average for 1st half of 2018 (250.089)/ annual average for \n1964 (31) = 8.1; CPI-U adjusted present dollar amount = $1,000 * 8.1 = $8,100.     \\632\\ See, e.g., Wallis v. U.S. ex \nrel. Mannara, 273 F. 509, 511 (2d Cir. 1921) ($1000 public charge bond posted in September 1920, which would \namount to about $12,600.30 in July 2018); Matter of Viado, 19 I&N Dec. 252, 252 (BIA 1985) ($5000 bond posted in \nFebruary 1979, which would amount to about $$18,234.88 in July 2018); In re Obligor, 2007 WL 5326596, at *1 \n(AAO June 6, 2007) (adjustment upon $10,000 bond in June 1999, which would amount to about $15,162.82 in July \n2018). For purposes of these calculations, DHS used the CPI Inflation Calculator from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics at            https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm (last visited Aug. 20th, 2018). -----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------      If USCIS determines that the alien seeking an adjustment of status may \nsubmit a public charge bond, neither the alien nor an obligor, including a surety company, would be able to appeal \nthe amount of the bond required.\\633\\ As discussed more fully in this preamble, DHS has discretion to allow an \nalien to post a public charge bond ``in such amount and containing such conditions'' as DHS may prescribe. Given \nthe discretionary nature of DHS's authority under section 213 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183, DHS has determined that \nthe bond amount would not be appealable administratively either to the AAO or the BIA, because neither \nadministrative body has jurisdiction over this discretionary determination.\\634\\ -------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------      \\633\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(b).     \\634\\ See United States ex rel. Chanin v. Williams, \n177 F. 689, 690 (2d Cir. 1910) (``The matter of admission under bond of a person once found to be likely to become \na public charge is by the statute confided to the Secretary, and we do not see why his refusal to admit is not an \nadverse exercise of such discretion in any particular case. His reasons for refusal may or may not seem persuasive \nto a court; but it is to him, not to the court, that Congress has confided the discretion.''); see also In re Obligor, 2007 \nWL 5326596, at *1 (AAO June 6, 2007) (sustained appeal that public charge bond was not breached). The BIA \ndoes not have jurisdiction. 8 CFR 1003.1(b) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      As \nindicated above, under this proposed rule, USCIS would notify the alien of the bond amount and conditions, \nincluding the type of bond the alien may submit. Each submission would be on the form designated and in \naccordance with the applicable instructions and fees prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7. While the proposed rule  [[Page \n51222]]  retains the options for a surety bond or a cash or cash equivalent such as a cashier's check or money \norder deposit and agreement to secure a bond, due to operational feasibility considerations USCIS plans to initially \nallow for only surety bonds.\\635\\ For example, surety bonds do not involve the actual exchange of money until the \nbond is breached, while the undertaking of cash bonds involves additional accounting mechanisms, including the \nmanagement of interest. DHS proposes to use new USCIS Form I-945, Public Charge Bond for this purpose. As \ndiscussed in greater detail below, DHS is proposing a $25 public charge bond processing fee to be submitted with \nthe Form I-945. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\635\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(b)(1). \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------       For all public charge surety bonds, an acceptable \nsurety company is generally one that appears on the current Treasury Department Circular 570 as a company \nholding the requisite certificate of authority to act as a surety on Federal bonds.\\636\\ Treasury-certified sureties \nhave agents throughout the United States from whom aliens could seek assistance in procuring an appropriate \nbond.\\637\\ The Department of the Treasury certifies companies only after having evaluated a surety company's \nqualifications to underwrite Federal bonds, including whether those sureties meet the specified corporate and \nfinancial standards. Under 31 U.S.C. 9305(b)(3), a surety (or the obligor) must carry out its contracts and comply \nwith statutory requirements, including prompt payment of demands arising from an administratively final \ndetermination that the bond had been breached. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\636\\ \n\n\nSee 8 CFR 103.6(b); see also proposed 8 CFR 103.6, as published in 83 FR 25951 (June 5, 2018).     \\637\\ See \nDep't of Treasury Circular 570, Listing of Approved Sureties (July 1, 2018). -----------------------------------------------------\n----------------------      If an alien successfully posts a public charge bond in the amount and under the conditions \nspecified in the form instructions and USCIS notice, USCIS will continue to adjudicate the alien's application for \nadjustment of status and will grant such application if all eligibility criteria are met. Additionally, if the bond has been \nsuccessfully posted, USCIS must ensure that the bond is maintained during the effective period of the bond. To \nachieve this goal, DHS proposes that an obligor would need to notify DHS within 30 days of any change in the \nobligor's or the alien's physical and mailing address. Given the contractual nature of the public charge bond, the \nchange of address requirement imposed is similar to the one imposed on a sponsor's change of address \nrequirement for purposes of the affidavit of support under 8 CFR 213a.3, except that the obligor would also need to \nnotify USCIS of the bonded alien's change of address. An alien would still need to comply with the change of \naddress requirements under section 265 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1305, and 8 CFR 265.1 to notify USCIS of his or her \nchange of address.     If the alien does not respond to the notice soliciting a public charge bond, or the bond \nsubmitted does not comply with the bond amount and conditions set by USCIS, USCIS will deny the alien's \napplication. Given the complexity of a bond process, DHS plans to issue separate guidance addressing the \nspecifics of public charge bond submission. 5. Public Charge Bond Substitution     DHS proposes that if USCIS \naccepts a bond of limited duration, the bond on file must be substituted with a new bond 180 days before the bond \non file with USCIS expires.\\638\\ A bond of limited duration is a bond that expires on a date certain regardless of \nwhether the statutory terms for cancellation of such a bond have been met (i.e., naturalization, permanent \ndeparture, or death of the alien). A bond of unlimited duration is a bond that does not have a specific end date but \nends upon USCIS canceling the bond. Bonds of limited duration are sometimes easier and cheaper to obtain and \nDHS is proposing to allow for this option so long as a substitute bond is valid and effective before the expiration \ndate of the bond on file. Because a bond has to be maintained until cancelled by USCIS, substitution ensures \ncontinuous indemnification of the United States against the alien receiving public benefits until the conditions for the \ncancellation of the bond have been met. Additionally, requiring that the substitute bond for a bond of limited duration \nis submitted to DHS at least 180 days before the expiration of the bond previously submitted expires permits USCIS \nto allow for some time to adjudicate the sufficiency of any substitute bonds, which further ensures continuous \nindemnification of the United States against the alien receiving public benefits. -------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------      \\638\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nEither the obligor, a substitute obligor, or the alien would be able to submit the substitute bond at any time and \nregardless of the reasons. The substitute bond would need to be valid, properly submitted with the appropriate fee, \nand effective on the day the previously submitted bond on file with USCIS expires. The substitute bond would need \nto meet all of the requirements applicable to the bond on file with USCIS, as required by 8 CFR 103.6 and 8 CFR \n213.1. To ensure continued bond coverage of the alien as required under section 213 of the Act, the substitute \nbond would also need to cover a bond breach that occurred before USCIS accepted the substitute bond, in the \nevent USCIS does not have knowledge of the breach until after the expiration or cancellation of the bond on file with \nUSCIS. If USCIS determined that the substitute bond proffered is sufficient, it would accept the bond and the bond \nwould become effective on the day the bond currently on file expires or when the new bond takes effect, if prior to \nthe expiration of the bond on file.\\639\\ Additionally, the bond previously on file would be cancelled, if needed.\\640\\ If \nthe substitute bond was insufficient, USCIS would notify the obligor of the substitute bond so that the obligor could \ncorrect the deficiency within the timeframe stipulated in the notice. USCIS may also send a copy of the notification \nto the alien, the alien's representative (if any), and the initial obligor. If the deficiency is not corrected within the \ntimeframe stipulated in the notice, the substitute would be rejected. ----------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------      \\639\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1.     \\640\\ For purposes of this type of cancellation, neither the obligor \nnor the alien must submit Form I-356. Form I-356 is submitted to assess whether the alien has received any public \nbenefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), or otherwise breached a condition of the bond. At the time for substitution, \nUSCIS does not engage in a breach assessment as the bond is substituted with another, not actually cancelled \naccording to the terms of proposed 8 CFR 213.1(g). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  6. \nPublic Charge Bond Cancellation (a) Conditions     A public charge bond must remain in effect until the alien \nnaturalizes or otherwise obtains U.S. citizenship, permanently departs the United States, or dies, until the bond is \nsubstituted with another bond, or until the bond is otherwise cancelled by DHS.\\641\\ During this period, as a \ncondition of the bond, an alien on whose behalf a public charge bond has been accepted agrees to not receive \npublic benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), after the alien's adjustment of status to that of a legal permanent \n\n\n\nresident and until the bond is cancelled according to proposed 8 CFR 212.21(g). The alien also has to comply with \nany other conditions imposed as part of the bond. That means that a bond is considered breached if the alien \nreceives public benefits, as defined in proposed 8 CFR 212.21(b), after the  [[Page 51223]]  alien's adjustment of \nstatus to that of a lawful permanent resident and until the bond is cancelled under proposed 8 CFR 213.1(g). A \nbond is also considered breached if the alien fails to comply with any other condition of the bond. In these \nsituations, USCIS cannot cancel the bond. Public benefits, as defined in proposed 8 CFR 212.21(b), received by an \nalien present in the United States in an immigration status that is exempt from the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility under section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), and public benefits received after the alien \nobtained U.S. citizenship are not counted towards any breach determination, and therefore, also for purposes of the \ncancellation determination.\\642\\ Additionally, consistent with the public benefits definition proposed in this rule, DHS \nwould not consider as part of a public charge bond cancellation determination any public benefits received by an \nalien enlisted in the U.S. armed forces under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B) or 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(2), serving \nin active duty or in the Ready Reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces, or if received by such an individual's \nspouse or child as defined in section 101(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b), regardless of whether such receipt \noccurred prior to the alien enlisting into the U.S. Armed Forces. ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------      \\641\\ See INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183; see also proposed 8 CFR 213.1.     \\642\\ See proposed 8 CFR \n213.1(h). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  (b) Definition of Permanent Departure     \nAccording to section 213 of the Act, a public charge bond must be cancelled when the alien naturalizes or otherwise \nobtains U.S. citizenship, permanently departs the United States, or dies. When codifying section 213 of the Act, \nCongress did not define ``permanent'' and the concept of permanent departure does not exist in other areas of \nimmigration law. However, ``permanent'' is defined in section 101(a)(31) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(31), as ``a \nrelationship of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship may be permanent \neven though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either of the United States or of the \nindividual, in accordance with law.'' ``Departing'' or ``departure'' is not defined in the INA, but DHS believes that it is \nreasonable to conclude that permanent departure for the purposes of canceling a public charge bond means that \nthe alien has left the United States on a lasting, non-temporary basis after losing the lawful permanent resident \nstatus either voluntarily or involuntarily, and is physically outside the United States. Losing lawful permanent \nresident status either voluntarily or involuntary coupled with physically leaving the United States is consistent with \nthe INA's definition for permanent. The proposed rule will clarify that an alien has permanently departed for bond \ncancellation when he or she has (1) lost or abandoned lawful permanent resident status, whether involuntary by \noperation of law or voluntarily, and (2) physically left the United States.\\643\\ An alien must establish that both \nelements, as described above, have been met before USCIS may cancel the bond. ------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------      \\643\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----      DHS further proposes that an alien is only deemed to have involuntarily lost lawful permanent resident \nstatus in removal proceedings with the entry of a final order of removal \\644\\ or through rescission of adjustment of \nstatus.\\645\\ An alien may be found to have abandoned LPR status, even if the assessment is made outside of \nremoval proceedings and if the alien's actions were unintentional.\\646\\ If an alien loses his or her LPR status \nthrough operation of law, the alien would be required to provide evidence of the loss of status by submitting \nevidence of the official determination of loss of LPR status before USCIS will cancel the bond.\\647\\ ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------      \\644\\ See 8 CFR 1.2; see also Matter of Lok, 18 I&N Dec. 101, 105-06 \n(BIA 1981).     \\645\\ See INA section 246, 8 U.S.C. 1256.     \\646\\ Abandonment is not directly addressed in the \nINA. The question typically arises in the context of LPRs returning to the United States. INA section 101(a)(20), 8 \nU.S.C. 1101(a)(20), defines the term ``lawfully admitted for permanent residence'' as ``the status of having been \nlawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the \nimmigration laws, such status not having changed'' (emphasis added). INA section 211(b), 8 U.S.C. 1181, \nprovides for a waiver of the documentary requirements for admission for one who can qualify as a ``returning \nresident immigrant'' as defined in INA section 101(a)(27)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(A), that is as ``an immigrant, \nlawfully admitted for permanent residence, who is returning from a temporary visit abroad.'' Finally, according to INA \nsection 101(a)(13)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(C)(i), an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the \nUnited States is not regarded as seeking admission into the United States, unless the alien has abandoned or \nrelinquished that status. See also INA section 223, 8 U.S.C. 1203.     \\647\\ For example, if the alien has his or her \nlawful permanent resident status in removal proceedings, the alien must present a copy of the removal order. --------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------      Generally, determining whether an alien has abandoned his \n\n\n\nor her status is highly fact specific and courts consider factors such as the length of an alien's absence from the \nUnited States, family and employment ties, property holdings, residence, and the alien's intent or actions.\\648\\ An \nalien may intentionally relinquish lawful permanent resident status through his or her voluntary actions, such as by \nsubmitting a declaration of intent to abandon LPR status. Neither the INA nor DHS regulations direct how aliens \nmay formally inform the U.S. Government of their abandoning their lawful permanent resident status. To simplify the \nprocess, USCIS had developed, in the past, Form I-407, Record of Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident \nStatus as a means by which an alien may formally record that they have abandoned LPR status. The purpose of \nthe form is to create a record and to ensure that the alien acts voluntarily and willingly, and is informed of the right \nto a hearing before an Immigration Judge and has knowingly, willingly, and affirmatively waived that right.\\649\\ -----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------      \\648\\ See, e.g., Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. 749, 755-57 \n(BIA 1988) (considering the alien's absence from the United States because of her husband's work and study \nabroad, as well as her own employment abroad, to find that her absence was not temporary in nature and that she \nhad abandoned her LPR status); Matter of Kane, 15 I&N Dec. 258, 265 (BIA 1975) (alien who spent 11 months per \nyear living in her native country operating a lodging house abandoned her LPR status; her desire to retain her \nstatus, without more, was not sufficient); Matter of Quijencio, 15 I&N Dec. 95, 97-98 (BIA 1974) (alien's lawful \npermanent resident status considered abandoned after 12 year absence); Matter of Castro, 14 I&N Dec. 492, 494 \n(BIA 1973) (alien who severed his ties to the United States for six years, moved abroad, acquired land, built a \nhouse and obtained steady employment, but made brief business trips to the United States was not a returning \nresident and had abandoned his status); Matter of Montero, 14 I&N Dec. 399, 400-01 (BIA 1973) (alien who \nreturned to her native country to join her husband, children, home, employment and financial resources without \nfixed intent to return within a fixed period had abandoned her lawful permanent resident status); cf. Khoshfahm v. \nHolder, 655 F.3d 1147, 1154 (9th Cir. 2011) (alien child who was out of the country for 6 years and prevented from \nreturning due to the father's heart condition and the events of September 11 did not abandon his lawful permanent \nresident status).     \\649\\ See Purpose of Form I-407 and its instructions at            www.uscis.gov/i-407. Even \nthough an alien completed and submitted Form I-407, the alien may still challenge the declaration of abandonment \nas part of removal proceedings because a declaration is not dispositive. ---------------------------------------------------------\n------------------      Given that it is difficult to assess whether an alien voluntarily abandoned his or her lawful \npermanent resident status, DHS proposes that an alien may demonstrate voluntarily relinquishment of the lawful \npermanent resident status for purposes of bond cancellation only by showing proof that he or she has submitted \nForm I-407 to the U.S. Government.\\650\\ In addition to the advantages of the Form I-407 enumerated above, \nrequiring evidence of a Form I-407 filing would ensure consistent adjudication of bond cancellation requests \nbecause officers have the necessary information and would not have to otherwise determine  [[Page 51224]]  the \nalien's intent in regards to the voluntary abandonment of the lawful permanent resident status and the permanent \ndeparture. Requesting the filing of a declaration would also be consistent with evidence required in the BIA \nprecedent Matter of De Los Santos, in which the bond was cancelled after the alien was required, among other \nthings, to submit a formal statement attesting to the desire to abandon permanent resident status.\\651\\ Form I-407 \nwould not have a fee. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\650\\ See proposed 8 CFR \n213.1.     \\651\\ Matter of De Los Santos, 11 I&N Dec. 121, 121 (BIA 1965). ------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------  (c) Bond Cancellation for Lawful Permanent Residents After 5 Years and Cancellation If the Alien \nObtains an Immigration Status Exempt From Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility Following the Initial Grant of \nLawful Permanent Resident Status     Currently, 8 CFR 103.6(c)(1) requires that DHS cancel a public charge bond \nsubmitted for an alien after the fifth anniversary of admission of the immigrant, provided that the alien has filed a \nrequest to cancel the bond and provided that the alien did not become a public charge prior to the fifth \nanniversary.\\652\\ The provision was added in 1984 based on INS's belief that the public would be adequately \nprotected even with such a limitation on the bond liability.\\653\\ INS reasoned that if an alien is self-sustaining for a \nfive-year period, it would not be probable that the alien becomes a public charge after five years because the \nreason for the becoming a public charge is based on factors in existence prior to admission as an immigrant.\\654\\ \nAdditionally, INS explained that limiting the bond liability in this manner parallels the deportation liability.\\655\\ --------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------      \\652\\ See 8 CFR 103.6(c)(1).     \\653\\ See Powers and \nDuties of Service Officers, Availability of Service Records; Public Charge Bonds, 49 FR 24010, 24011 (June 11, \n1984).     \\654\\ See 49 FR 24010, 24011.     \\655\\ See 49 FR 24010, 24011 (``The Service believes that the public \nwill be adequately protected by limiting the duration of liability of public charge bonds to a five-year period which \nparallels the deportation liability.'') ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS proposes to \n\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/i-407\n\n\ncontinue to cancel the public charge bond after the fifth anniversary of the alien's adjustment of status to that of a \nlawful permanent resident, provided that the alien files a request to cancel the bond and the alien has not received \nany public benefits as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b) after obtaining lawful permanent resident status or otherwise \nviolated the conditions of the public charge bond. Retaining the possibility for this type of cancellation of the public \ncharge bond is not just consistent with the current period of time in which an alien may become removable for \nreceiving public benefits after entry for causes that existed prior to entry,\\656\\ but is also consistent with the 5-year \nineligibility period for certain public benefits under PRWORA.\\657\\ Finally, as noted previously, the public charge \nbond statutory provision requires DHS to cancel the bond upon the alien's death, naturalization, or permanent \ndeparture from the United States.\\658\\ However, DHS believes that section 213 of the Act sets forth the situations \nwhen DHS must cancel the public charge bond, but leaves to DHS the discretion of canceling the bond for other \nreasons.\\659\\ Therefore, retaining the cancellation provision is consistent with the statutory text and the purpose of \nthis rule. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\656\\ See INA section 237(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \n1227(a)(5).     \\657\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1611-1646.     \\658\\ See INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183 (``Such bond or \nundertaking shall terminate upon the permanent departure from the United States, the naturalization, or the death of \nsuch alien, and any sums or other security held to secure performance thereof, except to the extent forfeited for \nviolation of the terms thereof, shall be returned to the person by whom furnished, or to his legal representatives.'' \n(emphasis added)).     \\659\\ See 8 CFR 103.6(c)(1) (``The district director may cancel a public charge bond at any \ntime if he/she finds that the immigrant is not likely to become a public charge. A bond may also be cancelled in \norder to allow substitution of another bond. A public charge bond shall be cancelled by the district director upon \nreview following the fifth anniversary of the admission of the immigrant, provided that the alien has filed Form I-356, \nRequest for Cancellation of Public Charge Bond, and the district director finds that the immigrant did not become a \npublic charge prior to the fifth anniversary. If Form I-356 is not filed, the bond shall remain in effect until the form is \nfiled and the district director reviews the evidence supporting the form and renders a decision to breach or cancel \nthe bond.''). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In addition, DHS is proposing to not retain \nthe discretion to cancel a public charge bond at any time if it subsequently determines that the alien is not likely to \nbecome a public charge.\\660\\ First, for many aliens who adjust status in the United States, DHS is unlikely to make \na second public charge determination under section 212(a)(4) of the Act.\\661\\ Second, given that Congress \nselected a 5-year timeframe in related contexts (in the parallel deportation statue under section 237(a)(5) of the Act, \n8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5), under PRWORA at 8 U.S.C. 1613, and as part of naturalization requirements under INA \nsection 316, 8 U.S.C. 1427), DHS believes that retaining a bond for at least 5 years is a reasonable timeframe that \nwill ensure the ability of U.S. government to recoup the costs of public benefits that may be received by aliens \nbefore most of them are generally eligible to naturalize. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\660\\ See 8 CFR 103.6(c)(1).     \\661\\ See INA section 101(a)(13)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(C), under which an LPR \nwould be considered an applicant for admission only under specifically outlined circumstances (e.g.. if he or she \nhas abandoned LPR status, was absent from the United States continuously longer than 180 days, has engaged in \nillegal activity after departing the United States, etc.). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nFinally, DHS proposes that USCIS would cancel the public charge bond if an alien subject to a public charge bond \nobtains an immigration status while present in the United States that is exempt from public charge grounds of \ninadmissibility, as listed in 8 CFR 212.23, following the initial grant of status as a lawful permanent resident, \nprovided that the alien or the obligor has filed a request for cancellation of public charge bond, on the form \ndesignated by DHS, in accordance with form instructions, and provided that the alien has not breached the bond \nconditions as described in paragraphs (h) of proposed 8 CFR 213.1. An example of when this ground of \ncancellation may apply is if an alien loses or abandons his or her LPR status but nonetheless qualifies for another \nstatus not subject to public charge inadmissibility, e.g. asylum. DHS believes that maintaining the bond in this \nsituation no longer serves the intended purpose of the bond if the population is exempt from public charge grounds \nof inadmissibility, as the purpose of the public charge bond is to ensure that the alien does not become a public \ncharge.\\662\\ As discussed in the section on exemptions, most of these aliens are, at that time, members of a \nvulnerable population, and the status provided to these aliens serves distinct policy goals separate from the general \nimmigration system. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\662\\ See INA section 213, 8 \nU.S.C. 1183. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      As with other bases for bond cancellation, \nhowever, if a request for cancellation of a public charge bond is not filed, the bond shall remain in effect until the \nform is filed, reviewed, and a decision is rendered. Additionally, if these aliens adjust status in the future on a basis \nthat is subject to section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), they may again be subject to public charge \n\n\n\ngrounds of inadmissibility and DHS may assess whether a bond is appropriate at that time. (d) Request To Cancel \nthe Bond, and Adjudication of the Cancelation Request     DHS proposes that USCIS would cancel the bond upon \nrequest by the alien, following a determination that the conditions of a bond have been met and the bond has not \nbeen breached, as outlined in proposed 8 CFR 213.1.  [[Page 51225]]  Return of the bond amount is ``to the extent \n[the bond] has been forfeited for violation of the terms thereof.'' \\663\\ DHS proposes to interpret this authority to \nallow DHS to impose, as a condition of the bond, forfeiture of the entire amount in the event of a breach. Once \nUSCIS determines that the alien has violated the bond conditions by receiving public benefits, USCIS would declare \nthe bond breached and collect. The request to cancel the bond would be submitted on the form designated by DHS, \naccording to its instructions, and with any mandatory fee. USCIS proposes to designate Form I-356, Request for \nCancellation of Public Charge Bond, to be used to request cancellation of a public charge bond. As discussed in \nmore detail below, DHS is also proposing an initial processing fee of $25 to be submitted with the Form I-356. \nGiven the obligor's and the alien's interest in having the bond cancelled, the alien, or the obligor or co-obligor, would \nbe able to submit a request to cancel the public charge bond to USCIS. ----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------      \\663\\ See INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183. --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-      A request to cancel the bond is necessary because typically, after an alien obtains an immigration benefit \nfrom USCIS or enters as an immigrant, USCIS has little interaction with the alien until he or she seeks another \nimmigration benefit. In addition, USCIS is typically not notified if an alien has permanently departed or died. \nInformation currently collected by DHS is insufficient for USCIS to determine on its own whether the alien intended \na departure to be permanent. Therefore, as part of the cancellation request, the alien would need to submit \nevidence of naturalization or otherwise having obtained U.S. citizenship, permanent departure, or if the person is \ndeceased, the alien's executor would submit a death certificate. Additionally, the alien or the alien's executor must \nalso submit the information requested in Form I-356 regarding receipt of public benefits as defined in 8 CFR \n212.21(b).\\664\\ Any information collected would be in accordance with relevant privacy laws. ------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------      \\664\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. ----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------      The obligor and the alien would have the burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, \nthat the conditions for cancellation of the public charge bond have been met.\\665\\ If USCIS finds that the \ninformation included in the request is insufficient to determine whether cancellation is appropriate, USCIS may \nrequest additional information in accordance with 8 CFR part 103. -----------------------------------------------------------------\n----------      \\665\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  (e) Decision \nand Appeal     If USCIS determines that the request warrants a cancellation of a bond, USCIS would notify the \nobligor, and return the full value of any cash or cash equivalent, such as a cashier's check or money order \ndeposited by the obligor to secure the bond plus interest, similar to current practice.\\666\\ When the bond is \ncancelled, the obligor would be released from liability.\\667\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\666\\ See 8 CFR 103.6(c) and proposed 8 CFR 213.1.     \\667\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. -------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------      If USCIS denies the request to cancel the bond, it will notify the obligor of the \nreasons why and of the right to appeal in accordance with the requirements of 8 CFR part 103, subpart A.\\668\\ A \nbond obligor could appeal the denial to cancel the bond to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) of USCIS by \nfiling Notice of Appeal or Motion (Form I-290B) together with the appropriate fee and required evidence. See 8 CFR \n103.1; 103.3. For operational efficiency, DHS proposes that an obligor may only file a motion after an unfavorable \ndecision by the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) on appeal. As part of an appeal, the regulations a 8 CFR \n103.3(a)(2) require the officer rendering the initial decision to review the initial decision; if the reviewing officer \nagrees that the decision is incorrect, he or she may treat the appeal as a motion and may enter a favorable \ndecision.\\669\\ USCIS would also inform the alien and the alien's representative (if any) of the denial. The alien \nwould not be able to appeal a denial because the bond contract is between the obligor and the U.S. government; \nthe alien is not party to the contract.\\670\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\668\\ See \nproposed 8 CFR 213.1.     \\669\\ See 8 CFR 103.3(a)(2)(ii)-(v).     \\670\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------  7. Breach of a Public Charge Bond and Appeal (a) Breach Conditions and \nAdjudication     A bond would be considered breached if the alien has received public benefits, as defined in \nproposed 8 CFR 212.21(b), after the alien's adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident and until the \npublic charge bond is cancelled under 8 CFR 213.1(g). Consistent with other proposed regulatory provisions \ncontained in this NPRM, public benefits received during periods while an alien is present in the United States in a \nstatus exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, as listed in 8 CFR 212.23, following the initial grant \nof lawful permanent resident status, would not be considered when determining whether the conditions of the bond \n\n\n\nhave been breached. Additionally, consistent with the public benefits definition proposed in this rule, DHS would not \nconsider as part of a public charge bond breach determination any public benefits received by an alien enlisted in \nthe U.S. armed forces under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B) or 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(2), serving in active duty or \nin the Ready Reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces, or if received by such an individual's spouse or child \nas defined in section 101(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b), regardless of whether such receipt occurred prior to the \nalien enlisting into the U.S. Armed Forces. Finally, DHS would not consider public benefits received after the alien \nwho is the subject of the public charge bond obtains U.S. citizenship, as U.S. citizens are no longer subject to public \ncharge grounds of inadmissibility, and therefore, the term of the public charge bond.     A bond would be considered \nbreached if any other condition imposed by USCIS as part of the public charge bond is breached.\\671\\ -----------------\n----------------------------------------------------------      \\671\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(d) and 8 CFR 213.1(h) --------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------      Under current 8 CFR 103.6, an immigration bond is considered \nbreached when there has been a substantial violation of the stipulated conditions. The term ``substantial violation'' \nis generally interpreted according to contractual principles.\\672\\ However, public charge bonds have been \ndistinguished from other immigration bonds in this regard, given that the public charge bond's condition is that the \nalien will not become a public charge.\\673\\ Therefore, DHS proposes to not retain the phrase ``substantial violation'' \nin the proposed public charge bond provision at 8 CFR 213.1. Instead, DHS proposes to incorporate the substantial \nviolation standard via incorporating principles that govern the public charge and public benefits definitions at \nproposed 8 CFR 212.21(a) and (b) (defining public charge and public benefits). Under the proposed approach, the \nbond would be  [[Page 51226]]  considered breached if the alien receives public benefits after the alien's adjustment \nof status to that of a lawful permanent resident and until the bond is cancelled pursuant to 8 CFR 213.1(g), or if the \nalien breaches any other condition imposed as part of the bond.\\674\\ -------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------      \\672\\ See, e.g., Aguilar v. United States, 124 Fed. Cl. 9, 16 (2015) (substantial violation under 8 CFR \n103.6(e) of a delivery immigration bond is a matter of contract interpretation, in which courts have looked to four \nfactors: (1) The extent of the breach; (2) whether the breach was intentional or accidental; (3) whether the breach \nwas in good faith; and (4) whether the obligor took steps to make amends or place himself in compliance).     \\673\\ \nSee Matter of Viado, 19 I&N Dec. 252, 253 (BIA 1985) (each of the other types of immigration bonds provided in \nthe regulation has its own specific conditions; the public charge bond's condition is that the alien will not become a \npublic charge, and the lack of knowledge or good faith of the alien did not render the breach insubstantial).     \\674\\ \nSee proposed 8 CFR 213.1(h). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      If USCIS learns of the \nbreach, and declares a bond breached based on information that is not otherwise protected from the disclosure to \nthe obligor, USCIS would disclose such information to the obligor to the extent permitted by law. For example, \nUSCIS may learn of an alien's having received public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), if the public benefit-\ngranting agency notifies USCIS that it provided a public benefit(s) to the alien who was admitted on bond.\\675\\ Or, \nUSCIS may learn from the alien, as part of a bond cancellation request that he or she received public benefits, as \ndefined in 8 CFR 212.21(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\675\\ See INA section 213, \n8 U.S.C. 1183. Receipt of public benefits, however, is sufficient to cause a breach of the public charge bond, even \nin the absence of a demand for repayment. See Matter of Viado, 19 I&N Dec. 252, 253 (BIA 1985). ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------      If USCIS found that it has insufficient information to determine whether \na breach occurred, USCIS would request additional information from the benefits granting agency, or USCIS would \nrequest additional information from alien or the obligor as outlined in 8 CFR part 103. USCIS would also provide the \nobligor with the opportunity to respond and submit rebuttal evidence, including specifying a deadline for a response. \nDHS furthermore proposes that it would send a copy of any notification to the obligor or co-obligor regarding the \nbreach also to the alien and the alien's representative (if any).\\676\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------      \\676\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  (b) \nDecision and Appeal     After the obligor's response or after the deadline for a response has passed, USCIS would \nmake a breach determination, and inform the obligor of the right to appeal in accordance with the requirements of 8 \nCFR 103, subpart A. See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(h). A bond obligor would have the possibility to appeal a breach \ndetermination to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) of USCIS by filing a Notice of Appeal or Motion (Form I-\n290B) together with the appropriate fee and required evidence. See 8 CFR 103.1; 103.3. Under this rule, DHS \nproposes that the obligor would only be able to file a motion under 8 CFR 103.5 as part of the unfavorable decision \non appeal. DHS believes that such an approach reasonable and operationally efficient; additionally, it provides \nclarity as to when a breach determination becomes administratively final, as defined in 8 CFR 213.1(h). First, as \npart of an appeal, pursuant to 8 CFR 103.3(a)(2), a USCIS officer who made the initial breach determination must \n\n\n\nreview the decision before the appeal can be forwarded to the AAO.\\677\\ If the USCIS agrees with the appealing \nparty that favorable action may be warranted, he or she may treat the appeal as a motion and then take favorable \naction, which would resolve the appeal.\\678\\ However, the official is also not precluded from reopening a \nproceeding or reconsidering a decision on his or her own motion under 8 CFR 103.5(a)(5)(i). If the reviewing official \nis not inclined to take a favorable action, the reviewing official will forward the appeal to the AAO. Once the AAO \nissues the decision, however, an obligor may file a motion of the AAO's decision in accordance with 8 CFR \n103.5.\\679\\ Thus, limiting when a motion can be filed is efficient for both the obligor and USCIS. Additionally, a \nbreach determination would be administratively final, among other instances, if the appeals period to the AAO \nexpires; filing a motion does not toll the appeals period stated in 8 CFR 103.3, and if the obligor fails to appeal, the \nbreach determination would become administratively final unless the motion is granted. The denial of a motion can \nthen be appealed to the AAO, and the AAO decision itself, if unfavorable, may be motioned in accordance with 8 \nCFR 103.5. Additionally, USCIS may reopen a breach determination at any time pursuant to 8 CFR 103.5, even if \nan appeal is pending. For these reasons, it appears to be more efficient for all parties if the obligor simply appeals a \nbreach determination in the first instance, if review of the initial breach determination is desired. --------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------      \\677\\ See 8 CFR 103.3(a)(2); see also Adjudicator's Field Manual, Chapter \n10.8.     \\678\\ See 8 CFR 103.3(a)(2); see also Adjudicator's Field Manual, Chapter 10.8.     \\679\\ See 8 CFR 103.5; \nsee Administrative Appeal's Office Practice Manual, Chapter 4, Motions to Reopen and Reconsider. --------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------      If the appeal is dismissed or rejected, or the obligor fails to appeal, the \nbreach determination becomes the final agency determination, and USCIS would issue a demand for payment, if \nthe bond was a surety bond, pursuant to 31 CFR 901.2.\\680\\ The alien may not appeal the breach determination or \nfile a motion because the bond contract is between the obligor and the U.S. government; the alien is not party to the \ncontract.\\681\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\680\\ See 8 CFR 103.6(e); see proposed \n8 CFR 213.1; see generally United States v.

Public Charge Bond Processing Fees     DHS is proposing \nto charge for the processing of public charge bonds and cancellation requests. In this rule, DHS proposes to charge \n$25 for the posting of a public charge bond, $25 for the posting of a substitute public charge bond, and $25 when \nthe alien, obligor or co- obligor requests to cancel the public charge bond (i.e., when the Form I-356 is filed). INA \nsection 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m), authorizes DHS to set fees for providing adjudication and naturalization services \nat a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing all such services. USCIS must expend resources to \nprocess public charge bonds and bond cancellation requests, including start-up costs to operationalize a public \ncharge bond process. USCIS is primarily funded by immigration and naturalization benefit request fees charged to \napplicants and petitioners. Fees collected from individuals and entities filing immigration benefit requests are \ndeposited into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account (IEFA) and used to fund the cost of processing \nimmigration benefit requests and providing related services (i.e., biometric collections).\\687\\ In addition, DHS \ncomplies with the requirements and principles of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, 31 U.S.C. 901-03, (CFO \nAct), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25. USCIS reviews the fees deposited into the IEFA \nbiennially and, if necessary, proposes adjustments to ensure recovery of costs necessary to meet national security, \ncustomer service, and adjudicative processing goals. USCIS typically uses projected volume data and completion \nrates (the average time for adjudication of an immigration benefit request) to set the fees for specific immigration \nbenefit requests, and related services. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\687\\ See U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule, 81 FR 26904, 26940 (May 4, 2016). ---------------------------------\n------------------------------------------      The proposed $25 fees will not result in recovery of the full cost of intake and \nadjudication the proposed Forms I-945 and I-356. However, at this time, DHS is not able to estimate the start-up \ncosts for establishing a public charge bond process, nor the number of public charge bonds or cancellation requests \nthat it will receive during any period of time because both the form and process are new to USCIS, and USCIS does \nnot have a reasonable proxy on which to rely for an estimate. In addition, public charge bonds are very fact-specific; \nUSCIS will make a case-by-case determination on whether to offer the submission of a bond to an applicant. \nSimilarly, whether a cancellation request is submitted will be driven by the particular circumstances of each alien by \nwhom or on whose behalf a bond is posted, depending on whether conditions for cancellation have been met. \nNevertheless, to recover at least some of the costs of adjudicating Forms I-945 and I- 356, and avoid other fee \npayers having to fund the public charge bond process entirely, DHS is proposing a $25 fee for the initial public \ncharge bond submission, and a $25 fee for the bond cancellation request, with no option to request a fee waiver. \nOnce USCIS implements a public charge bond process, it will be able to obtain data on the volume and burden of \npublic charge bonds and cancellation requests and adjust these fees to amounts necessary to recover the relative \ncosts of these adjudications next time that USCIS reviews the fees deposited into the IEFA. 10. Other Technical \nChanges     In addition to amending 8 CFR 103.6 and 213.1 to update and establish requirements specific to public \ncharge bonds, this proposed rule would make technical changes to 8 CFR 103.6 to update references to offices and \nform names. 11. Concurrent Surety Bond Rulemaking     On June 5, 2018, DHS published a proposed rule that \nwould set forth procedures and standards under which DHS would decline surety immigration bonds from \nTreasury-certified companies.\\688\\ The June 5 proposed rule would also create administrative exhaustion \nrequirements applicable to sureties. This public charge proposed rule is not intended to displace or otherwise affect \nthe proposed changes to 8 CFR 103.6 in the June 5, 2018 proposed rule, although a final public charge rule may \ndepart from the June 5 rule with respect to surety bonds breach determinations, as described above. DHS plans to \nconduct the two rulemakings concurrently. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\688\\ See \nProcedures and Standards for Declining Surety Immigration Bonds and Administrative Appeal Requirement for \nBreaches, 83 FR 25951 (June 5, 2018). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  VI. Statutory and \nRegulatory Requirements  A. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), Executive Order 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), and Executive Order 13771 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling \nRegulatory Costs)      Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of \navailable regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net \nbenefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and \nequity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, \n\n\n\nharmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. Executive Order 13771 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling \nRegulatory Costs) directs agencies to reduce regulation and control regulatory costs.     This proposed rule is \ndesignated a ``significant regulatory action'' that is economically significant since it is estimated that the proposed \nrule would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order \n12866. Accordingly, OMB has reviewed this proposed regulation. 1. Summary     As previously discussed, DHS is \nproposing to modify its regulations to add new regulatory provisions for inadmissibility determinations based on \npublic charge grounds under the INA. DHS is proposing to prescribe how it determines whether an alien is \ninadmissible because he or she is likely at any time to become a public charge and identify the types of public \nbenefits that are considered in the public charge determinations. An alien applying for a visa, admission at the port \nof entry, or adjustment of status generally must establish that he or she is not likely at any time to become a public \ncharge. DHS proposes that certain factors may be weighed positively or negatively, depending on how the factor \nimpacts the immigrant's likelihood to become a public charge. DHS is also proposing to revise existing regulations \nto clarify when and how it considers public charge when adjudicating change of status and extension of stay \napplications. Finally, DHS is proposing to revise its regulations governing the Secretary's discretion to accept a \npublic  [[Page 51228]]  charge bond or similar undertaking under section 213 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1183. Similar to a \nwaiver, a public charge bond permits an alien deemed inadmissible on the public charge ground to obtain \nadjustment of status, if otherwise admissible.\\689\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\689\\ There is no mention of ``waiver'' or ``waive'' in INA section 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183. However, the BIA has viewed \nthat provision as functioning as a waiver of the public charge ground of inadmissibility. See Matter of Ulloa, 22 I&N \nDec. 725, 726 (BIA 1999). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      This proposed rule would \nimpose new costs on the population applying to adjust status using Form I-485 that are subject to the public charge \ngrounds on inadmissibility who would now be required to file the new Form I-944 as part of the public charge \ninadmissibility determination. DHS would require any adjustment applicants subject to the public charge \ninadmissibility ground to submit Forms I-944 with their Form I-485 to demonstrate they are not likely to become a \npublic charge. In addition, Form I-129 and Form I-129CW beneficiaries, and Form I-539 filers may also incur \nadditional costs should they receive a RFE to file Form I-944 to determine inadmissibility based on public charge \ngrounds under the provisions of this proposed rule. The proposed rule would also impose additional costs for \ncompleting Forms I-485, I- 129, I-129CW, and I-539 as the associated time burden estimate for completing each of \nthese forms would increase. Moreover, the proposed rule would impose new costs associated with the proposed \npublic charge bond process, including new costs for completing and filing Form I-945, Public Charge Bond, and \nForm I-356, Request for Cancellation of Public Charge Bond. DHS estimates that the additional total cost of the \nproposed rule would range from approximately $45,313,422 to $129,596,845 annually to the population applying to \nadjust status who also would be required to file Form I-944, for the opportunity cost of time associated with the \nincreased time burden estimates for Forms I- 485, I-129, I-129CW, and I-539, and for requesting or cancelling a \npublic charge bond using Form I-944 and Form I-356, respectively.     Over the first 10 years of implementation, \nDHS estimates the total quantified new direct costs of the proposed rule would range from about $453,134,220 to \n$1,295,968,450 (undiscounted). In addition, DHS estimates that the 10-year discounted total direct costs of this \nproposed rule would range from about $386,532,679 to $1,105,487,375 at a 3 percent discount rate and about \n$318,262,513 to $910,234,008 at a 7 percent discount rate.     The proposed rule would impose new costs on the \npopulation seeking extension of stay or change of status using Form I-129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-539 since, \nfor any of these forms, USCIS adjudication officers would then be able to exercise discretion in determining whether \nit would be necessary to issue a RFE whereby a Form I-129 or I- 129CW beneficiary or a Form I-539 applicant may \nthen have to submit Form I-944. DHS conducted a sensitivity analysis estimating the potential cost of filing Form I-\n129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-539 for a range of 10 to 100 percent of beneficiaries or filers, respectively, receiving \na RFE to submit Form I-944. The costs to Form I-129 beneficiaries who may receive a RFE to file Form I-944 range \nfrom $6,086,318 to $60,863,181 annually and the costs to Form I-129CW beneficiaries who may receive such a \nRFE from $114,132 to $1,141,315 annually. The costs to Form I-539 applicants who may receive a RFE to file \nForm I-944 range from $3,164,375 to $31,643,752 annually.     The proposed rule would also potentially impose \nnew costs on individuals or companies (obligors) if an alien has been found to be a public charge, but has been \ngiven the opportunity to submit a public charge bond, for which USCIS intends to use the new Form I-945. DHS \nestimates the total cost to file Form I-945 would be at minimum about $34,234 annually.\\690\\ -----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------      \\690\\ Calculation: $35.66 (cost per obligor to file Form I-945) * 960 \n(estimated annual population who would file Form I-945) = $34,233.60 = $34,234 (rounded) annual total cost to file \n\n\n\nForm I-945. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Moreover, the proposed rule would \npotentially impose new costs on aliens or obligors (individuals or entities) who would submit Form I- 356 as part of a \nrequest to cancel the public charge bond. DHS estimates the total cost to file Form I-356 would be approximately \n$825 annually.\\691\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\691\\ Calculation: $33.00 (cost per \nobligor to file Form I-356) * 25 (estimated annual population who would file Form I-356) = $825.00 annual total cost \nto file Form I-356. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The proposed rule would also result \nin a reduction in transfer payments from the federal government to individuals who may choose to disenroll from or \nforego enrollment in a public benefits program. Individuals who might choose to disenroll from or forego future \nenrollment in a public benefits program include foreign-born non- citizens as well as U.S. citizens who are members \nof mixed-status households.\\692\\ DHS estimates that the total reduction in transfer payments from the federal and \nstate governments would be approximately $2.27 billion annually due to disenrollment or foregone enrollment in \npublic benefits programs by foreign-born non-citizens who may be receiving public benefits. DHS estimates that the \n10-year discounted federal and state transfer payments reduction of this proposed rule would be approximately \n$19.3 billion at a 3 percent discount rate and about $15.9 billion at a 7 percent discount rate. However, DHS notes \nthere may be additional reductions in transfer payments that we are unable to quantify. There may also be \nadditional reductions in transfer payments from states to individuals who may choose to disenroll from or forego \nenrollment in a public benefits program. Because state participation in these programs may vary depending on the \ntype of benefit provided, DHS was only able to estimate the impact of state transfers. For example, the federal \ngovernment funds all SNAP food expenses, but only 50 percent of allowable administrative costs for regular \noperating expenses.\\693\\ Similarly, Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) in some HHS programs like \nMedicaid can vary from between 50 percent to an enhanced rate of 100 percent in some cases.\\694\\ However, \nassuming that the state share of federal financial participation (FFP) is 50 percent, the 10-year discounted amount \nof state transfer payments of this proposed policy would be approximately $9.65 billion at a 3 percent discount rate \nand about $7.95 billion at a 7 percent discount rate. Finally, DHS recognizes that reductions in federal and state \ntransfers under federal benefit programs may have downstream and upstream impacts on state and local \neconomies, large and small businesses, and individuals. For example, the rule might result in reduced revenues for \nhealthcare providers participating in Medicaid, pharmacies that provide prescriptions to  [[Page 51229]]  participants \nin the Medicare Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) program, companies that manufacture medical supplies or \npharmaceuticals, grocery retailers participating in SNAP, agricultural producers who grow foods that are eligible for \npurchase using SNAP benefits, or landlords participating in federally funded housing programs. --------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------      \\692\\ DHS uses the term ``foreign-born non-citizens'' because it is the term \nused by the Census Bureau for which much of the data in this analysis is based on. DHS generally interprets this \nterm to mean alien in this analysis.     \\693\\ Per section 16(a) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008.

Accessed Sept. 13, 2018. ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------      Additionally, the proposed rule would add new direct and indirect impacts on various \nentities and individuals associated with regulatory familiarization with the provisions of the rule. Familiarization costs \ninvolve the time spent reading the details of a rule to understand its changes. A foreign-born non-citizen (such as \nthose contemplating disenrollment or foregoing enrollment in a public benefits program) might review the rule to \ndetermine whether they are subject to the provisions of the proposed rule and may incur familiarization costs. To \nthe extent that an individual or entity directly regulated by the rule incurs familiarization costs, those familiarization \ncosts are a direct cost of the rule. In addition to those individuals or entities the rule directly regulates, a wide variety \nof other entities would likely choose to read the rule and, therefore, would incur familiarization costs. For example, \nimmigration lawyers, immigration advocacy groups, health care providers of all types, non-profit organizations, \nnon- governmental organizations, and religious organizations, among others, may need or want to become familiar \nwith the provisions of this proposed rule. DHS believes such non-profit organizations and other advocacy groups \nmight choose to read the rule in order to provide information to those foreign-born non-citizens that might be \naffected by a reduction in federal and state transfer payments. Familiarization costs incurred by those not directly \nregulated are indirect costs.     DHS estimates the time that would be necessary to read this proposed rule would be \n\n\napproximately 8 to 10 hours per person, resulting in opportunity costs of time. An entity, such as a non-profit or \nadvocacy group, may have more than one person that reads the rule.     The primary benefit of the proposed rule \nwould be to help ensure that aliens who are admitted to the United States, seek extension of stay or change of \nstatus, or apply for adjustment of status are not likely to receive public benefits and will be self-sufficient, i.e., \nindividuals will rely on their own financial resources, as well as the financial resources of the family, sponsors, and \nprivate organizations.\\695\\ DHS also anticipates that the proposed rule would produce some benefits from the \nelimination of Form I-864W. The elimination of this form would potentially reduce the number of forms USCIS would \nhave to process. DHS estimates the amount of cost savings that would accrue from eliminating Form I-864W would \nbe $35.78 per petitioner.\\696\\ However, DHS notes that we are unable to determine the annual number of filings of \nForm I-864W and, therefore, we are currently unable to estimate the total annual cost savings of this change. \nAdditionally, a public charge bond process would also provide benefits to applicants as they potentially would be \ngiven the opportunity to be adjusted if otherwise admissible, at the discretion of DHS, after a determination that he \nor she is likely to become a public charge. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\695\\ 8 \nU.S.C. 1601(2).     \\696\\ Calculation of savings from opportunity cost of time for no longer having to complete and \nsubmit Form I-864W: ($35.78 per hour * 1.0 hours) = $35.78. ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---      Table 36 provides a more detailed summary of the proposed provisions and their impacts.

Such individuals would be applying from within the United States, rather than applying for a visa from outside \nthe United States at a DOS consulate abroad. In addition, the impact of this proposed rule on nonimmigrants who \nare seeking an extension of stay or a change of status are also examined in this analysis.     The new process \nDHS is proposing for making a determination of inadmissibility based on public charge incorporates a new form--\nForm I- 944--in the current process to apply for adjustment of status. Currently, as part of the requirements for filing \nForm I-485, applicants submit biometrics collection for fingerprints and signature, and also file Form I-693 which is \nto be completed by a designated civil surgeon. Form I-693 is used to report results of a medical examination to \nUSCIS.     Form I-864 (Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA) is also filed to satisfy the requirements \nof section 213A of the Act for most family-based immigrants and some employment-based immigrants to show that \nthey have adequate means of financial support and are not likely to become a public charge. When a sponsor \ncompletes and signs Form I-864 in support of an intending immigrant, the sponsor agrees to use his or her \nresources, financial or otherwise, to support the intending immigrant named in the affidavit, if it becomes necessary.     \nImmigrants required to submit Form I-864 completed by a sponsor to obtain an immigrant visa overseas or to adjust \nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident in the United States, include (1) immediate relatives of U.S. citizens \n(spouses, unmarried children under 21 years of age, and parents of U.S. citizens 21 years of age and older); (2) \nfamily-based preference immigrants (unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, spouses and unmarried sons \nand daughters of lawful permanent residents, married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, and brothers and sisters \nof U.S. citizens 21 years of age and older); and (3) employment-based preference immigrants in cases only when a \nU.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national relative filed the immigrant visa petition or such relative has \na significant ownership interest (5 percent or more) in the entity that filed the petition. However, immigrants seeking \ncertain visa classifications are exempt from the requirement to submit a Form I-864 as are intending immigrants \nwho have earned or can receive credit for 40 qualifying quarters (credits) of work in the United States.     \nAdditionally, some sponsors for intending immigrants may be able to file an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A \nof the INA (Form I- 864EZ). Form I-864EZ is a shorter version of Form I-864 and is designed for cases that meet \ncertain criteria. A sponsor may file Form I-864EZ only if: (1) The sponsor is the person who filed or is filing a Petition \nfor Alien Relative (Form I-130) for a relative being sponsored; (2) the relative being sponsored is the only person \nlisted on Form I-130; and (3) the income the sponsor is using for qualification is based entirely on salary or pension \nand is shown on one or more Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2s provided by employers or former \nemployers.     Form I-864 includes attachment, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member (Form I-864A), \nwhich may be filed when a sponsor's income and assets do not meet the income requirements of Form I-864 and \nthe qualifying household member chooses to combine his or her resources with the income and/or assets of a \nsponsor to meet those requirements. A sponsor must file a separate Form I-864A for each household member \nwhose income and/or assets the sponsor is using to meet the affidavit of support income requirements. The Form I-\n864A contract must be submitted with Form I-864. The Form I-864A serves as a contractual agreement between \nthe sponsor and household member that, along with the sponsor, the household member is responsible for \nproviding financial and material support to the sponsored immigrant.     In cases where the petitioning sponsor \ncannot meet the income requirements by him or herself, an individual seeking an immigrant visa or adjustment of \nstatus may also meet the affidavit of support requirement by obtaining a joint sponsor who is willing to accept joint \nand several liability with the petitioning sponsor as to the obligation to provide support to the sponsored alien. The \njoint sponsor must demonstrate income or assets that independently meet the requirements to support the \nsponsored immigrant(s) as required under section 213A(f)(2) and (f)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1883a(f)(2) and \n(f)(5)(A). The joint sponsor's income and assets may not be combined with the income/assets of the petitioning \nsponsor or the sponsored immigrant. Both the petitioning sponsor and the joint sponsor must each complete a Form \nI-864.     Certain classes of immigrants currently are exempt from the requirement to file Form I-864 or Form I-\n864EZ and therefore must file Form I-864W. DHS proposes to eliminate Form I-864W and instead individuals would \nnow be required to provide the information previously requested on the Form I-864W using Form I-485. Based on \nthe information provided in the Form I-485, an officer can verify whether an alien is statutorily required to file an \naffidavit of support.     Some applicants seeking adjustment of status may be eligible for a fee waiver when filing \nForm I-485. An applicant who is unable to pay the filing fees or biometric services fees for an application or petition \nmay obtain a fee waiver by filing a Request for Fee Waiver (Form I-912). If an applicant's Form I-912 is approved, \nthe agency will waive both the filing fee and biometric services fee. Therefore, DHS assumes for the purposes of \nthis economic analysis that the filing fees and biometric services fees required for Form I-485 are waived if an \n\n\n\napproved Form I-912 accompanies the application.     When filing Form I-485, a fee waiver is only available if the \napplicant is applying for adjustment of status based on:      Special Immigrant Status based on an approved Form I-\n360 as an Afghan or Iraqi Interpreter, or Afghan or Iraqi national employed by or on behalf of the U.S. Government; \nor      An adjustment provision that is exempt from the public charge grounds of inadmissibility under section \n212(a)(4) of the INA, including but not limited to the Cuban Adjustment Act, the Haitian Refugee Immigration \nFairness Act (HRIFA), and the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), or similar \nprovisions; continuous residence in the United States since before January 1, 1972, ``Registry,''  [[Page 51237]]  \nAsylum Status under section 209(b) of the INA, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, and Lautenberg parolees.     \nAdditionally, the following individuals seeking adjustment of status may apply for a fee waiver for Form I-485:      \nBattered spouses of A, G, E-3, or H nonimmigrants;      Battered spouses or children of a lawful permanent resident \nor U.S. citizen under INA section 240A(b)(2);      T nonimmigrants;      U nonimmigrants; or      VAWA self-\npetitioners.     DHS is proposing to facilitate the current Form I-485 application process by creating a new form--\nForm I-944--which would collect information to the extent allowed by relevant laws based on factors such as age; \nhealth; family status; assets, resources, and financial status; education and skills; and any additional financial \nsupport through an affidavit of support, so that DHS could determine whether an applicant applying for adjustment \nof status who is subject to public charge review would be inadmissible to the United States based on public charge \ngrounds. For the analysis of this proposed rule, DHS assumes that all individuals who apply for an adjustment of \nstatus using Form I-485 are required to submit Form I-944, unless he or she is in a class of applicants that is \nexempt from review for determination of inadmissibility based on public charge at the time of adjustment of status \naccording to statute or regulation.     In addition to those applying for an adjustment of status, any alien applying for \nan extension of stay or change of status as a nonimmigrant in the United States would now be required to \ndemonstrate that he or she is neither using nor receiving, nor likely to receive, public benefits as defined in this \nproposed rule unless the applicant is in a class of admission or is seeking to change to a class of admission that is \nexempt from inadmissibility on public charge grounds.     For applicants seeking adjustment of status or an \nimmigrant visa who are likely to become a public charge after the review for determination of inadmissibility based \non public charge, DHS is proposing to establish a bond process for such aliens. DHS currently does not have a \nspecific process or procedure in place to accept public charge bonds, though it has the authority to do so. The \nproposed public charge bond process would include DHS acceptance of a public charge bond posted on an \nadjustment of status applicant's behalf if the adjustment of status applicant was deemed inadmissible based on \npublic charge. The process would also include the possibility to substitute an existing bond, the requirement to \nsubstitute a bond before the bond on file with DHS expires, the DHS determination of breach of a public charge \nbond, the possibility to file an appeal upon a breach determination, cancellation of a public charge bond, and the \npossibility to submit an appeal upon denial of the cancellation request. 3. Population     This proposed rule would \naffect individuals who are present in the United States who are seeking an adjustment of status to that of a lawful \npermanent resident. According to statute, an individual who is seeking adjustment of status and is at any time likely \nto become a public charge is ineligible for such adjustment.\\705\\ The grounds of inadmissibility set forth in section \n212 of the Act also apply when certain aliens seek admission to the United States, whether for a temporary purpose \nor permanently. However, the grounds of public charge inadmissibility (including ineligibility for adjustment of status) \ndo not apply to all applicants since there are various classes of admission that Congress expressly exempted from \nthe public charge inadmissibility ground. Within USCIS, this proposed rule would affect individuals who apply for \nadjustment of status since these individuals would be required to be reviewed for a determination of inadmissibility \nbased on public charge grounds as long as the individual is not in a class of admission that is exempt from review \nfor public charge. In addition, the proposed rule would affect individuals applying for an extension of stay or change \nof status because these individuals would have to demonstrate that they have not received, are not currently \nreceiving, and are not likely to receive public benefits in the future, as defined in the proposed rule. This analysis \nestimates the populations from each of these groups that would be subject to review for receipt of public benefits. \nDHS notes that the population estimates are based on aliens present in the United States who are applying for \nadjustment of status or extension of stay or change of status, rather than individuals outside the United States who \nmust apply for an immigrant visa through consular processing at a DOS consulate abroad. ---------------------------------\n------------------------------------------      \\705\\ See INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). ----------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------  (a) Population Seeking Adjustment of Status     With this proposed rule, DHS \nintends to ensure that aliens who apply for adjustment of status are self-sufficient and will rely on their own financial \nresources, as well of those of their families, sponsors, and private organizations. Therefore, DHS estimates the \n\n\n\npopulation of individuals who are applying for adjustment of status using Form I-485.\\706\\ Under the proposed rule, \nthese individuals would undergo review for determination of inadmissibility based on public charge grounds, unless \nan individual is in a class of admission that is exempt from review for public charge determination. -----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------      \\706\\ Data on the population of individuals who are applying for \nadjustment of status and the class of admission come from U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Yearbook of \nImmigration Statistics for years 2012 to 2016.

In general, the annual \npopulation of individuals who applied to adjust status was consistent. Over the 5-year period, the population of \nindividuals applying for adjustment of status ranged from a low of 530,802 in fiscal year 2013 to a high of 565,427 in \nfiscal year 2016. In addition, the average population of individuals over 5 fiscal years who applied for adjustment of \nstatus over this period was 544,246.  [[Page 51238]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.062      DHS \nwelcomes any public comments on our estimates of the total number of individuals applying for adjustment of status \nin the United States as the primary basis for developing population estimates of those who would be subject to \nreview for determination of inadmissibility based on public charge grounds. i. Exemptions From Determination of \nInadmissibility Based on Public Charge Grounds     There are exemptions and waivers for certain classes of \nadmission that are not subject to review for determination of inadmissibility based on public charge grounds. Table \n39 shows the classes of applicants for admission, adjustment of status, or registry according to statute or regulation \nthat are exempt from inadmissibility based on public charge grounds. BILLING CODE 4410-10-P  [[Page 51239]]  \n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.063   [[Page 51240]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.064  \nBILLING CODE 4410-10-C     To estimate the annual total population of individuals seeking to adjust status who \nwould be subject to review for inadmissibility based on public charge grounds, DHS examined the annual total \npopulation of individuals who applied for adjustment of status for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. For each fiscal year, \nDHS removed individuals from the population whose classes of admission are exempt from public charge review for \ninadmissibility, as shown in table 39, leaving the total population that would be subject to such review. Further \ndiscussion of these exempt classes of admission can be found in the preamble.     Table 40 shows the total \nestimated population of individuals seeking to adjust status under a class of admission that is exempt from review \nfor inadmissibility based on public charge grounds for fiscal years 2012 to 2016 as well as the total estimated \npopulation that would be subject to public charge review.\\707\\ In fiscal year 2016, for example, the total number of \npersons who applied for an adjustment of status across various classes of admission was 565,427 (see table 38). \nAfter removing individuals from this population whose classes of admission are exempt from examination for public \ncharge, DHS estimates the total population of adjustment applicants in fiscal year 2016 that would be subject to \npublic charge review for inadmissibility is 382,769.\\708\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\707\\ Calculation of total estimated population that would be subject to public charge review: (Total Population \nApplying for Adjustment of Status)-(Total Population Seeking Adjustment of Status that is Exempt from Public \nCharge Review for Inadmissibility) = Total Population Subject to Public Charge Review for Inadmissibility.     \\708\\ \nCalculation of total population subject to public charge review for inadmissibility for fiscal year 2016: 565,427-\n182,658 = 382,769.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page 51241]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF \nOMITTED] TP10OC18.065      DHS estimates the projected annual average total population of adjustment \napplicants that would be subject to public charge review for inadmissibility by DHS is 382,264. This estimate is \nbased on the 5-year average of the annual estimated total population subject to public charge review for \ninadmissibility from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. Over this 5-year period, the estimated population of \nindividuals applying for adjustment of status subject to public charge review ranged from a low of 366,125 in fiscal \nyear 2015 to a high of 397,988 in fiscal year 2013.     DHS welcomes any public comments on our estimates of the \ntotal population of individuals seeking to adjust status under a class of admission that is exempt from review for \ninadmissibility based on public charge grounds as well as the total population that would be subject to public charge \nreview. DHS notes that the population estimates are based on immigrants present in the United States who are \napplying for adjustment of status, rather than immigrants outside the United States who must apply for an immigrant \nvisa through consular processing at DOS consulate abroad. ii. Exemptions From the Requirement To Submit an \nAffidavit of Support     In addition to the exemptions from inadmissibility based on public charge, certain classes of \nadmission are exempt from the requirement to submit an affidavit of support for applicants for admission, \nadjustment of status, or registry. Certain applicants applying for adjustment of status are required to submit an \n\n\naffidavit of support from a sponsor or otherwise be found inadmissible as likely to become a public charge. When an \naffidavit of support is submitted, a contract is established between the sponsor and the U.S. Government to \nestablish a legally enforceable obligation to support the applicant financially.     Table 41 shows the estimated total \npopulation of individuals seeking adjustment of status who were exempt from the requirement to submit an affidavit \nof support from a sponsor over the period fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016.\\709\\ The table also shows the total \nestimated population that was required to submit an affidavit of support showing evidence of having adequate \nmeans of financial support so that an applicant would not be found inadmissible as likely to become a public charge \nfor failure to submit a sufficient affidavit of support. Further discussion of these exempt classes of admission can be \nfound in the preamble. The estimated annual average population of individuals seeking to adjust status who were \nrequired to submit a public charge affidavit of support from a sponsor over the 5-year period was 257,610. Over this \n5-year period, the estimated population of individuals required to submit a public charge affidavit of support from a \nsponsor ranged from a low of 247,011 in fiscal year 2015 to a high of 272,451 in fiscal year 2016. ------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------      \\709\\ Data on the population of individuals who are applying for \nadjustment of status and the class of admission come from U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Yearbook of \nImmigration Statistics for years 2012 to 2016.

This \nestimate is based on the 5-year average of the annual estimated total population of applicants applying for \nadjustment of status that would be subject to the requirement to submit an affidavit of support from a sponsor from \nfiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. Over this 5-year period, the estimated population of such individuals applying \nfor adjustment of status ranged from a low of 247,011 in fiscal year 2015 to a high of 272,451 in fiscal year 2016.     \nDHS welcomes any public comments on our estimates of the total population of individuals seeking adjustment of \nstatus who were exempt from the requirement to submit an affidavit of support as well as the total population that \nwas required to submit an affidavit of support showing evidence of having adequate means of financial support so \nthat an applicant would not be found inadmissible as likely become a public charge for failure to submit a sufficient \naffidavit of support. DHS notes that the population estimates are based on immigrants present in the United States \nwho are applying for adjustment of status, rather than immigrants outside the United States who must apply for an \nimmigrant visa through consular processing at a U.S. Department of State consulate abroad. (b) Population \nSeeking Extension of Stay or Change of Status     Nonimmigrants in the United States may apply for an extension \nof stay or change of status by having Form I-129 filed by an employer on his or her behalf. An employer uses Form \nI-129 to petition USCIS for a beneficiary to enter the United States temporarily as a nonimmigrant to perform \nservices or labor, or to receive training. The Form I-129 can also be used to request an extension or change in \nstatus. In addition, an employer may use Form I-129CW to petition USCIS for a foreign national who is ineligible for \nanother employment-based nonimmigrant classification to work as a nonimmigrant in the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands (CNMI) temporarily as a CW-1, CNMI-Only Transitional Worker. Moreover, an employer \nmay also use Form I-129CW to request an extension of stay or change of status for a CNMI-Only Transitional \nWorker.     A nonimmigrant may file Form I-539 so long as the nonimmigrant is currently in an eligible nonimmigrant \ncategory. A nonimmigrant generally must submit an application for extension of stay or change of status before his \nor her current authorized stay expires. In addition to determining inadmissibility based on public charge for \nindividuals seeking adjustment of status, DHS is proposing to conduct reviews of nonimmigrants who apply for \nextension of stay or change of status to determine whether the applicant has demonstrated that he or she has not \nreceived, is not receiving, nor is likely to receive, public benefits, as defined in the proposed rule.\\710\\ However, \nDHS proposes that such determinations would not require applicants seeking extension of stay or change of status \nto file Form I-944. Instead, USCIS officers would be able to exercise discretion regarding whether it would be \nnecessary to issue a RFE whereby an applicant would then have to submit Form I- 944. ------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------      \\710\\ Past or current receipt of public benefits, alone, would not justify a finding of \ninadmissibility on public charge grounds. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Table 42 \nshows the total estimated population of beneficiaries seeking extension of stay or change of status through an \nemployer petition using Form I-129 for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. DHS estimated this population based on receipts \nof Form I-129 in each fiscal year. Over this 5-year period, the estimated population of individuals who would be \nsubject to a determination of inadmissibility on public charge grounds ranged from a low of 282,225 in fiscal year \n\n\n2013 to a high of 377,221 in fiscal year 2012. The estimated average population of individuals seeking extension of \nstay or change of status over the five-year period fiscal year 2012 to 2016 was 336,335. DHS estimates that \n336,335 is the average annual projected population of beneficiaries seeking extension of stay or change of status \nthrough an employer petition using Form I-129 and  [[Page 51243]]  therefore subject to the discretionary RFEs for \npublic charge determination. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.067      Table 43 shows the total estimated \npopulation of beneficiaries seeking extension of stay or change of status through an employer petition using Form \nI-129CW for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. DHS estimated this population based on receipts of Form I-129CW in each \nfiscal year. Over this 5-year period, the estimated population of individuals who would be subject to a determination \nof inadmissibility on public charge grounds ranged from a low of 5,249 in fiscal year 2013 to a high of 8,273 in fiscal \nyear 2016. The estimated average population of individuals seeking extension of stay or change of status through \nForm I-129CW over the five-year period fiscal year 2012 to 2016 was 6,307. DHS estimates that 6,307 is the \naverage annual projected population of beneficiaries seeking extension of stay or change of status through an \nemployer petition using Form I-129CW and therefore subject to discretionary RFEs for public charge determination. \n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.068   [[Page 51244]]       Table 44 shows the total estimated population of \nindividuals seeking extension of stay or change of status using Form I-539 for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. DHS \nestimated this population based on receipts of Form I-539 in each fiscal year. Over this 5-year period, the estimated \npopulation of individuals who would be subject to a determination of inadmissibility on public charge grounds \nranged from a low of 149,583 in fiscal year 2013 to a high of 203,695 in fiscal year 2016. The estimated average \npopulation of individuals seeking extension of stay or change of status over the 5-year period from fiscal year 2012 \nto 2016 was 174,866. DHS estimates that 174,866 is the average annual projected population of individuals who \nwould seek an extension of stay and change of status using Form I-539 and therefore would be subject to the \ndiscretionary RFEs for public charge determination. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.069      DHS \nwelcomes any public comments on our estimates of the total population of employers filing on behalf of individuals \nseeking extension of stay or change of status using Form I-129 or Form I-129CW as well as the total of individuals \nseeking extension of stay or change of status using Form I-539, where DHS proposes that the total population \nusing each of these forms would be subject to review on a discretionary basis for determination of inadmissibility \nbased on public charge grounds. DHS notes that the population estimates are based on nonimmigrants present in \nthe United States who are applying for extension of stay or a change of status, rather than individuals outside the \nUnited States who must apply for a nonimmigrant visa through consular processing at a DOS consulate abroad. 4. \nCost-Benefit Analysis     DHS expects this proposed rule to produce costs and benefits associated with the \nprocedures for examining individuals seeking entry into the United States for inadmissibility based on public \ncharge.     For this proposed rule, DHS generally uses the federal minimum wage plus weighted average benefits of \n$10.66 per hour ($7.25 federal minimum wage base plus $3.41 weighted average benefits) as a reasonable proxy \nof time valuation to estimate the opportunity costs of time for individuals who are applying for adjustment of status \nand must be reviewed for determination of inadmissibility based on public charge grounds.\\711\\ DHS also uses \n$10.66 per hour to estimate the opportunity cost of time for individuals who cannot or choose not to participate in \nthe labor market as these individuals incur opportunity costs and/or assign valuation in deciding how to allocate \ntheir time. This analysis uses the federal minimum wage rate since approximately 80 percent of the total number of \nindividuals who obtained lawful permanent resident status were in a class of admission under family-sponsored \npreferences and other non-employment-based classifications such as diversity, refugees and asylees, and \nparolees.\\712\\ Therefore, DHS assumes many of these applicants hold positions in occupations that are likely to \npay around the federal minimum wage. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\711\\ See 29 \nU.S.C. 206--Minimum wage, available at            https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-\ntitle29/html/USCODE-2011-title29-chap8-sec206.htm (accessed Jan. 24, 2018).     \\712\\ See United States \nDepartment of Homeland Security.

Therefore, in this proposed rule, \nDHS calculates the total rate of compensation for individuals applying for adjustment of status as $10.66 per hour in \nthis proposed rule using the benefits-to-wage multiplier, where the mean hourly wage is $7.25 per hour worked and \naverage benefits are $3.41 per hour.\\714\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\713\\ The \nbenefits-to-wage multiplier is calculated as follows: (Total Employee Compensation per hour)/(Wages and Salaries \nper hour) = $36.32/$24.77 = 1.466 = 1.47 (rounded). See Economic News Release, Employer Cost for Employee \nCompensation (March 2018), U.S. Dept. of Labor, BLS, Table 1. Employer costs per hour worked for employee \ncompensation and costs as a percent of total compensation: Civilian workers, by major occupational and industry \ngroup. June 8, 2018, available at            https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06082018.pdf (viewed \nJune 20, 2018).     \\714\\ The calculation of the weighted federal minimum hourly wage for applicants: $7.25 per \nhour * 1.47 benefits-to-wage multiplier = $10.658 = $10.66 (rounded) per hour. ------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------      However, DHS uses the unweighted mean hourly wage of $24.34 per hour for all \noccupations to estimate the opportunity cost of time for some populations in this economic analysis, such as those \nsubmitting an affidavit of support for an immigrant seeking to adjust status and those requesting extension of stay \nor change of status. For populations such as this, DHS assumes that individuals are dispersed throughout the \nvarious occupational groups and industry sectors of the U.S. economy. For the population submitting an affidavit of \nsupport, therefore, DHS calculates the average total rate of compensation as $35.78 per hour, where the mean \nhourly wage is $24.34 per hour worked and average benefits are $11.46 per hour.715 716 ---------------------------------\n------------------------------------------      \\715\\ The national mean hourly wage across all occupations is reported to be \n$24.34. See Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates United States. May 2017. Department of Labor, BLS, \nOccupational Employment Statistics program; available at            https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes_nat.htm.     \n\\716\\ The calculation of the weighted mean hourly wage for applicants: $24.34 per hour * 1.47 = $35.779 = $35.78 \n(rounded) per hour. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS welcomes public comments \non its use of $10.66 per hour as the opportunity cost of time for most populations of this analysis (individuals in a \nclass of admission under family-sponsored preferences and other non-employment-based preferences) and $35.78 \nper hour as the opportunity cost of time for other populations, such as those submitting an affidavit of support for an \nimmigrant seeking to adjust status. (a) Baseline Estimate of Current Costs     The baseline estimate of current \ncosts is the best assessment of costs and benefits absent the proposed action. For this proposed rule, DHS \nestimates the baseline according to current operations and requirements and to that compares the estimated costs \nand benefits of the provisions set forth in the proposed rule. Therefore, DHS defines the baseline by assuming ``no \nchange'' to DHS regulations to establish an appropriate basis for evaluating the provisions of the proposed rule. \nDHS notes that costs detailed as part of the baseline include all current costs associated with completing and filing \nForm I-485, including required biometrics collection and medical examination (Form I-693) as well as any affidavits \nof support (Forms I-864, I-864A, I- 864EZ, and I-864W) or requested fee waivers (Form I-912). As noted previously \nin the background section, the source of additional costs imposed by this proposed rule would come from the \nproposed requirements to submit Form I-944 detailing information about an applicant regarding factors such as age, \nhealth, family status, finances, and education and skills. These costs are analyzed later in this economic analysis.     \nTable 45 shows the estimated population and annual costs of filing for adjustment of status and requesting an \nextension of stay or change of status for the proposed rule. These costs primarily result from the process of \napplying for adjustment of status, including filing Form I- 485 and Form I-693 as well as, if necessary, an affidavit of \nsupport and/or Form I-912. The costs are derived from the process of applying for extension of stay or change of \nstatus, including filing Form I-129, Form I-129CW, or Form I-539.

Form I-485, Application To Register Permanent Residence or \nAdjust Status     The basis of the quantitative costs estimated for this proposed rule is the cost of filing for \nadjustment of status using Form I-485, the opportunity cost of time for completing this form, any other required \nforms, and any other incidental costs (e.g., travel costs) an individual must bear that are required in the filing \nprocess. DHS reiterates that costs examined in this section are not additional costs that would be imposed by the \nproposed rule, but costs that applicants currently incur as part of the application process to adjust status. The \ncurrent filing fee for Form I-485 is $1,140. The fee is set at a level to recover the processing costs to DHS. As \npreviously discussed in the population section, the estimated average annual population of individuals who apply for \nadjustment of status using Form I-485 is 382,264. Therefore, DHS estimates that the annual filing cost associated \n\n\nfor Form I-485 is approximately $435,780,960.\\717\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\\717\\ Calculation: Form I-485 filing fee ($1,140) * Estimated annual population filing Form I-485 (382,264) = \n$435,780,960 annual cost for filing Form I-485. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS \nestimates the time burden of completing Form I-485 is 6.25 hours per response, including the time for reviewing \ninstructions, gathering the required documentation and information, completing the application, preparing \nstatements, attaching necessary documentation, and submitting the application.\\718\\ Using the total rate of \ncompensation for minimum wage of $10.66 per hour, DHS estimates the opportunity cost of time for completing and \nsubmitting Form I-485 would be $66.63 per applicant.\\719\\ Therefore, using the total population estimate of 382,264 \nannual filings for Form I-485, DHS estimates the total opportunity cost of time associated with completing Form I-\n485 is approximately $25,470,250 annually.\\720\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\718\\ \nSource: Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Supporting Statement for Form I-485 (OMB control number 1615-0023). \nThe PRA Supporting Statement can be found at Question 12 on Reginfo.gov at            \n\nPrivately Owned Vehicle (POV) Mileage Reimbursement Rates,            https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-\nbook/transportation-airfare-rates-pov-rates-etc/privately-owned-vehicle-pov-mileage-reimbursement-rates \n(accessed January 7, 2018).     \\727\\ Calculation: (Biometrics collection travel costs) * (Estimated annual population \nfiling Form I-485) = $27.25 * 382,264 = $10,416,694 annual travel costs related to biometrics collection for Form I-\n485. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In sum, DHS estimates the total current annual \ncost for filing Form I-485 is $519,114,512. The total current annual costs include Form I- 485 filing fees, biometrics \nservices fees, opportunity cost of time for completing Form I-485 and submitting biometrics information, and travel \ncost associated with biometrics collection.\\728\\ DHS notes that a medical examination is generally required as part \nof the application process to adjust status. Costs associated with the medical examination are detailed in the next \nsection. Moreover, costs associated with submitting an affidavit of support and requesting a fee waiver are also \ndetailed in subsequent sections since such costs are not required for every individual applying for an adjustment of \nstatus. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\728\\ Calculation: $435,780,960 (Annual filing \nfees for Form I- 485) + $25,470,250 (Opportunity cost of time for filing Form I-485) + $32,492,440 (Biometrics \nservices fees) + $14,954,168 (Opportunity cost of time for biometrics collection requirements) + $10,416,694 \n(Travel costs for biometrics collection) = $519,114,512 total current annual cost for filing Form I-485. --------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------  b. Form I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record     \nUSCIS requires most applicants who file Form I-485 seeking adjustment of status to submit Form I-693 completed \nby a designated civil surgeon. Form I-693 is used to report results of a medical examination to USCIS. For this \nanalysis, DHS assumes that all individuals who apply for adjustment of status using Form I-485 are required to \nsubmit Form I-693. DHS reiterates that costs examined in this section are not  [[Page 51248]]  additional costs that \nwould be imposed by the proposed rule, but costs that applicants currently incur as part of the application process \nto adjust status. The medical examination is required to establish that an applicant is not inadmissible to the United \nStates on health-related grounds. While there is no filing fee associated with Form I-693, the applicant is \nresponsible for paying all costs of the medical examination, including the cost of any follow-up tests or treatment \nthat is required, and must make payments directly to the civil surgeon or other health care provider. In addition, \napplicants bear the opportunity cost of time for completing the medical exam form as well as sitting for the medical \nexam and the time waiting to be examined.     USCIS does not regulate the fees charged by civil surgeons for the \ncompletion of a medical examination. In addition, medical examination fees vary by physician. DHS notes that the \ncost of the medical examinations may vary widely, from as little as $20 to as much as $1,000 per respondent \n(including vaccinations to additional medical evaluations and testing that may be required based on the medical \nconditions of the applicant).\\729\\ DHS estimates that the average cost for these activities is $490 and that all \napplicants would incur this cost.\\730\\ Since DHS assumes that all applicants who apply for adjustment of status \nusing Form I-485 must also submit Form I-693, DHS estimates that based on the estimated average annual \npopulation of 382,264 the annual cost associated with filing Form I-693 is $187,309,360.\\731\\ -----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------      \\729\\ Source for medical exam cost range: Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) \nReport of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (Form I-693) (OMB control number 1615-0033).

Form I-864P is \nused to determine the minimum level of income required to sponsor most family- based immigrants and some \nemployment-based immigrants. These income requirements are to show that a sponsor has adequate means of \nfinancial support and is not likely to rely on the government for financial support. Form I-864P is for informational \npurposes and used for completing Form I-864. DHS does not anticipate additional costs or benefits as a result of \nany proposed changes to Form I-864P. ii. Consideration of Receipt, or Likelihood of Receipt of Public Benefits \nDefined in Proposed 212.21(b) for Applicants Requesting Extension of Stay or Change of Status     Nonimmigrants \nin the United States may apply for extension of stay or change of status by either having an employer file Form I-\n129 or Form I-129CW, as applicable, on his or her behalf, or by filing Form I- 539, so long as the nonimmigrant is \ncurrently in an eligible nonimmigrant category. This proposed rule seeks to require nonimmigrants who are seeking \nextension of stay or change of status to demonstrate that they have not previously received, are not currently \nreceiving, nor are likely to receive public benefits in the future, as defined in this rule in 8 CFR 212.21(b. DHS also \nnotes that costs examined in this section are not additional costs that would be imposed by the proposed rule, but \ncosts that petitioners and applicants currently would incur as part of the application  [[Page 51251]]  process to \nrequest an extension of stay or change of status. a. Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker     The current \nfiling fee for Form I-129 is $460.00. The fee is set at a level to recover the processing costs to DHS. As previously \ndiscussed, the estimated average annual population of employers filing on behalf of nonimmigrant workers seeking \nEOS/COS using Form I-129 is 336,335. Therefore, DHS estimates that the annual cost associated with filing Form \nI-129 is approximately $154,714,100.\\754\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\754\\ \nCalculation: (Form I-129 filing fee) * (Estimated annual population filing Form I-129) = $460 * 336,335 = \n$154,714,100 annual estimated cost for filing Form I-129 seeking an extension of stay or change of status. ----------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------      DHS estimates the time burden for completing Form I-129 is 2 \nhours and 20 minutes (2.34 hours), including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering the required \ndocumentation and information, completing the request, preparing statements, attaching necessary documentation, \nand submitting the request.\\755\\ Using the average total rate of compensation of $35.78 per hour, DHS estimates \nthe opportunity cost of time for completing and submitting Form I-129 will be $83.73 per petitioner.\\756\\ Therefore, \nusing the total population estimate of 336,335 annual filings for Form I-129, DHS estimates the total opportunity \ncost of time associated with completing and submitting Form I-129 is approximately $28,161,330 annually.\\757\\ -----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------      \\755\\ Source for petition for nonimmigrant workers time \nburden estimate: Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) (OMB control \nnumber 1615-0009).

The fee is set at a level to \nrecover the processing costs to DHS. In addition, an employer filing Form I-129CW for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant \nTransitional Worker must submit an additional $200 for a supplemental CNMI education fee per beneficiary, per \nyear and a $50 fee for fraud prevention and detection with each petition. Thus, the total fees associated with filing \nForm I-129CW is $710 per beneficiary.\\761\\ As previously discussed, the estimated average annual population of \nemployers filing on behalf of nonimmigrant workers seeking EOS/COS using Form I-129CW is 6,307. Therefore, \nDHS estimates that the annual cost associated with filing Form I-129 is approximately $4,477,970.\\762\\ ----------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------      \\761\\ This economic analysis assumes that each Form I-129CW \nfiled will also be required to include the additional $200 supplemental CNMI education fee and the $50 fraud \nprevention and detection fee.     \\762\\ Calculation: (Form I-129CW filing fee) * (Estimated annual population filing \nForm I-129CW) = $710 * 6,307 = $4,477,970 annual estimated cost for filing Form I-129 seeking an extension of \nstay or change of status. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS estimates the time \nburden for completing Form I-129CW is 3 hours (3.0 hours), including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering \nthe required documentation and information, completing the petition, preparing statements, attaching necessary \ndocumentation, and submitting the request.\\763\\ Using the average total rate of compensation of $35.78 per hour, \nDHS estimates the opportunity cost of time for completing and submitting Form I-129CW will be $107.34 per \npetitioner.\\764\\ Therefore, using the total population estimate of 6,307 annual filings for Form I-129CW, DHS \nestimates the total opportunity cost of time associated with completing and submitting Form I-129CW is \napproximately $676,993 annually.\\765\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\763\\ Source \nfor petition for nonimmigrant workers time burden estimate: Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Petition for CNMI-Only \nNonimmigrant Transition Worker (Form I-129CW) (OMB control number 1615-0111).

For the analysis of this proposed rule, DHS assumes that all individuals who apply for adjustment \nof status using Form I-485 are required to submit Form I-944, unless the individual is in a class of applicants that is \nexempt from review for determination of inadmissibility based on public charge at the time of adjustment of status \naccording to statute or regulation.     There is currently no filing fee associated with Form I-944. However, DHS \nestimates the time burden associated with filing Form I- 944 is 4 hours and 30 minutes (4.5 hours) per applicant, \nincluding the time for reviewing instructions, gathering the required documentation and information, completing the \ndeclaration, preparing statements, attaching necessary documentation, and submitting the declaration. Therefore, \nusing the total rate of compensation of minimum wage of $10.66 per hour, DHS estimates the opportunity cost of \ntime for completing and submitting Form I-944 would be $47.97 per applicant.\\775\\ Using the total population \nestimate of 382,264 annual filings for Form I-485, DHS estimates the total opportunity cost of time associated with \ncompleting and submitting Form I-944 is approximately $18,337,204 annually.\\776\\ ------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------      \\775\\ Calculation for declaration of self-sufficiency opportunity cost of time: ($10.66 per \nhour * 4.5 hours) = $47.97 per applicant.     \\776\\ Calculation: (Estimated opportunity cost of time for Form I-944) * \n(Estimated annual population filing Form I-485) = $47.97 * 382,264 = $18,337,204.08 = $18,337,204 (rounded) \nannual opportunity cost of time for filing Form I-944. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In \naddition to the opportunity cost of time associated with completing and filing Form I-944, applicants must bear the \ncost of obtaining a credit report and credit score from any one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States \nto be submitted with the application.\\777\\ Consumers may obtain a free credit report once a year from each of the \nthree major consumer reporting agencies (i.e., credit bureaus) under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\\778\\ \nHowever, consumers are not necessarily entitled to a free credit score, for which consumer reporting agencies may \ncharge a fair and reasonable fee.\\779\\ DHS does not assume that all applicants are able to obtain a free credit \nreport under FCRA specifically for fulfilling the requirements of filing Form I-944 and acknowledges that obtaining a \ncredit score would be an additional cost. Therefore, DHS assumes that each applicant would bear the cost of \nobtaining a credit report and credit score from at least one of the three major credit bureaus. DHS estimates the \ncost of obtaining a credit report and credit score would be $19.95 per applicant, as this is the amount that two of the \nthree major credit bureaus charge.\\780\\ DHS notes that it would be required that all applicants who apply for \nadjustment of status using Form I-485 must also submit Form I-944 and comply with its requirements. Therefore, \nDHS estimates that based on the estimated average annual population of 382,264 the total annual cost associated \nwith obtaining a credit report and credit score as part of the requirements for filing Form I-944 would be \n$7,626,167.\\781\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\777\\ The three major credit bureaus \nare Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

For the proposed rule, DHS \nestimates that the time burden for completing  [[Page 51255]]  Form I-485 would increase by 10 minutes. Therefore, \nin the proposed rule, the time burden to complete Form I-485 would be 6 hours and 25 minutes (6.42 hours).     The \ntime burden includes the time for reviewing instructions, gathering the required documentation and information, \ncompleting the application, preparing statements, attaching necessary documentation, and submitting the \napplication.\\783\\ Using the total rate of compensation for minimum wage of $10.66 per hour, DHS currently \nestimates the opportunity cost of time for completing and filing Form I-485 would be $66.63 per applicant.\\784\\ \nTherefore, using the total population estimate of 382,264 annual filings for Form I-485, DHS estimates the current \ntotal opportunity cost of time associated with completing Form I-485 is approximately $25,470,250 annually.\\785\\ ---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\783\\ Source: Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) \nSupporting Statement for Form I-485 (OMB control number 1615-0023).

For the proposed rule, DHS estimates that the time burden for completing \nForm I-129CW would increase by 30 minutes to account for the additional time petitioners would spend reading the \nform and providing additional information. Therefore, DHS proposes the time burden to complete Form I-129CW to \npetitioners would be 3 hours and 30 minutes (3.5 hours).

Therefore, based on the total population \nestimate of 6,307 annual filings for Form I-129CW, DHS estimates the total annual opportunity cost of time \nassociated with completing Form I-944 would be approximately $1,015,490 annually and the total cost to obtain a \ncredit report and credit score would be about $125,825.\\812\\ In sum, DHS estimates that total cost for Form I-\n129CW beneficiaries who receive a RFE to complete and submit Form I-944 would be approximately $1,141,315 \nannually.\\813\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\811\\ Calculation for Form I-129CW \npetition opportunity cost of time to complete Form I-944: ($35.78 per hour * 4.5 hours) = $161.01.     \\812\\ \nCalculation: (Form I-944 estimated opportunity cost of time) * (Estimated annual population filing Form I-129CW) = \n$161.01 * 6,307 = $1,015,490.07 = $1,015,490 (rounded) annual opportunity cost of time for filing Form I-944. \nCalculation: (Cost to obtain a credit report and credit score) * (Estimated annual population filing Form I-129CW) = \n$19.95 * 6,307 = $125,824.65 = $125,825 (rounded) annual cost to obtain a credit report and credit score.     \\813\\ \nCalculation: (Annual opportunity cost of time for filing Form I-944) + (Annual cost to obtain a credit report and credit \nscore for Form I-944) = $1,015,490 + $125,825 = $1,141,315 annual total cost for Form I-129CW beneficiaries who \nmust file Form I-944. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      For filers of form I-539 who are \nrequired to complete and submit Form I-944, DHS estimates the opportunity cost of time for completing Form I-539 \nwould also be $161.01 per filer using the average total rate of compensation of $35.78 per hour. In addition, DHS \nestimates the cost to obtain a credit report and credit score is $19.95 per applicant. DHS estimates the total \nopportunity cost of time associated with completing Form I-944 would be approximately $28,155,175 annually \nbased on the total population estimate of 174,866 annual filings for Form I-539 and the total cost to obtain a credit \nreport and credit score would be about $3,488,577.\\814\\ In sum, DHS estimates that total cost for Form I-539 \napplicants who receive a RFE to complete and submit Form I-944 would be approximately $31,643,752 \nannually.\\815\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\814\\ Calculation: (Form I-944 estimated \nopportunity cost of time) * (Estimated annual population filing Form I-539) = $161.01 * 174,866 = $28,155,174.66 = \n$28,155,175 (rounded) annual opportunity cost of time for filing Form I-944. Calculation: (Cost to obtain a credit \nreport and credit score) * (Estimated annual population filing Form I-539) = $19.95 * 174,866 = $3,488,576.70 = \n$3,488,577 (rounded) annual cost to obtain a credit report and credit score.     \\815\\ Calculation: (Annual \nopportunity cost of time for filing Form I-944) + (Annual cost to obtain a credit report and credit score for Form I-\n944) = $28,155,175 + $3,488,577 = $31,643,752 annual total cost for Form I-539 applicants who must file Form I- \n944. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      DHS is unable to estimate the actual number of \nRFEs that adjudication officers may issue to Form I-129 beneficiaries, Form I- 129CW beneficiaries, and Form I-539 \nfilers to submit Form I-944 since such RFEs would be issued on a discretionary basis. However, we are able to \npresent a range of RFEs that could be issued based on total population estimates and the estimated annual cost \nassociated with such RFE. Table 48 presents a range of potential annual costs related to submission of Form I-944 \nbased on the percentage of the maximum number of Form I-129 beneficiaries, Form I-129CW beneficiaries, and \nForm I-539 applicants who could be issued a RFE. DHS estimates the annual cost if all beneficiaries were issued a \n\n\n\nRFE for 100 percent of the total population estimate of 336,335 annual filings for Form I-129 would be about $60.1 \nmillion. For the total population estimate of 6,307 annual filings for Form I-129CW, DHS estimates the annual cost \nwould be approximately $1.1 million if all beneficiaries were issued a RFE. Moreover, DHS estimates the annual \ncost if all applicants were issued a RFE for 100 percent of the total population estimate of 336,335 annual filings for \nForm I-539 would be about $31.6 million.

Public \nCharge Bond      DHS does not currently have a process or procedure in place to accept public charge bonds, \nthough it has the authority to do so. DHS is proposing to amend its regulations and establish a bond process for \nthose seeking adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident who have been deemed likely to become a \npublic charge. A public charge bond may generally be secured by cash or cash equivalents such as cashier's \nchecks or money orders in the full amount of the bond, or may be underwritten by a surety company certified by the \nDepartment of Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308.\\816\\ DHS approval of the public charge bond and DHS \ndetermination of whether the bond has been breached would be based on whether the alien has received public \nbenefits as defined in the proposed rule or whether the alien has breached any other condition imposed as part of \nthe public charge bond. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\816\\ See generally 8 CFR \n103.6. However, USCIS plans to initially allow for only surety bonds only. --------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------      As discussed elsewhere in the preamble, DHS has the broad authority to prescribe forms of \nbonds as is deemed necessary for carrying out the Secretary's authority under the provisions of the Act.\\817\\ \nAdditionally, an alien whom DHS has determined to be inadmissible based on public charge grounds may, if \notherwise admissible, be admitted at the discretion of the Secretary upon giving a suitable and proper bond.\\818\\ \nThe purpose of issuing a public charge bond is to better ensure that the alien will not become a public charge in the \nfuture. If an alien receives public benefits, as defined in proposed 8 CFR 212.21(b), after the alien's adjustment of \nstatus to that of a lawful permanent resident, DHS would declare the bond breached. A bond may also be breached \nif the conditions that are otherwise imposed as part of the public charge bond are breached.\\819\\ ------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------      \\817\\ See INA section 103(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(3).     \\818\\ See INA \nsection 213, 8 U.S.C. 1183.     \\819\\ See 8 CFR 213.1(h). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \nDHS is proposing that public charge bonds would be issued at the Secretary's discretion when an alien seeking \nadjustment of status has been found to be inadmissible based on public charge grounds. DHS may require an alien \nto submit a surety bond or cash or cash equivalent, such as a cashier's check or money order, to secure a \nbond.\\820\\ DHS would notify the alien if he or she is permitted to post a public charge bond and of the type of bond \nthat may be submitted. If DHS accepts a surety bond  [[Page 51259]]  as a public charge bond, DHS would accept \nonly a bond underwritten by surety companies certified by the Department of the Treasury, as outlined in proposed \n8 CFR 103.6(b).\\821\\ DHS proposes that the amount of a public charge bond cannot be less than $10,000 annually \nadjusted for inflation and rounded up to the nearest dollar, but the amount of the bond required would otherwise be \ndetermined at the discretion of the adjudication officer. After reviewing an alien's circumstances and finding of \ninadmissibility based on public charge grounds, an adjudication officer would notify the alien through the issuance \nof a RFE or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) that a surety bond may be submitted to USCIS. ----------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------      \\820\\ USCIS plans to initially allow surety bonds.     \\821\\ See 31 U.S.C. \n9304-9308. See also Bureau of the Fiscal Service, U.S. Department of Treasury, available at            \n\nimposed with the public charge bond.\\822\\ Upon learning of a breach of public charge bond, DHS would notify the \nobligor that the bond has been declared breached and inform the obligor of the possibility to appeal the \ndetermination to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO).\\823\\ Notice of Appeal or Motion (Form I-290B) is \nused to file an appeal or motion to reopen or reconsider certain decisions. -------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------      \\822\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(h).     \\823\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(h). --------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------      Finally, a public charge bond must be canceled when an alien with a bond \ndies, departs the United States permanently, or is naturalized or otherwise obtains U.S. citizenship, provided the \nindividual has not received public benefits, as defined in proposed 8 CFR 212.21(c) prior to death, departure, or \nnaturalization (or otherwise obtaining U.S. citizenship), and a request for cancellation has been filed.\\824\\ DHS \nmust also cancel the bond following the fifth anniversary of the admission of the lawful permanent resident provided \nthat he or she files a request for cancellation of the public charge bond and provided that the alien has not received \nany public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21, after the alien's adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent \nresident. Additionally, the public charge bond must be cancelled if the alien obtains an immigration status that is \nexempt from public charge inadmissibility after the initial grant of lawful permanent resident status, provided that a \nrequest for cancellation of the public charge bond has been filed and provided that the alien did not breach the \nbond conditions.\\825\\ To have the public charge bond cancelled, an obligor (individual or entity) would request the \ncancellation of the public charge and as part of the request, submit Form I-356. If DHS determines that the bond \ncannot be cancelled, the bond remains in place; the obligor may appeal the denial to the AAO by filing Form I-\n290B.\\826\\ Additionally, a public charge bond may be cancelled by DHS after a suitable substitute has been \nsubmitted for an unlimited bond or a bond of limited duration that bears an expiration date. For this type of \ncancellation, no request to cancel the bond must be filed to allow substitution of another bond, as outlined in \nproposed 8 CFR 213.\\827\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\824\\ See INA section 213, \n8 U.S.C. 1183; see 8 CFR 103.6(c).     \\825\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(d)[Conditions of the bond] and proposed 8 \nCFR 213.1(h)[Breach].     \\826\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(g).     \\827\\ See proposed 8 CFR 213.1(f)[Substitution]. \nBecause USCIS does not examine whether the bond could be breached, the substitution does not have to be \naccompanied with a filing of Form I-356. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      When posting \na surety bond, an individual generally pays between 1 percent to 15 percent of the bond amount for a surety \ncompany to post a bond.\\828\\ The percentage that an individual must pay may be dependent on the individual's \ncredit score where those with higher credit scores would be required to pay a lower percentage of the bond to be \nposted. DHS notes that an individual as another possible option for securing a public charge bond may be allowed \nto submit cash or cash equivalent, such as a cashier's check or money order and agreement. -----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------      \\828\\ For example, see            https://suretybondauthority.com /frequently-\nasked-questions/ and            https://suretybondauthority.com /learn-more/. DHS notes that the company cited is for \ninformational purposes only. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      With the creation of Form \nI-945, DHS proposes to charge a filing fee of $25.00 to submit a public charge surety bond, which would cover \nadministrative costs of processing the form. DHS estimates the time burden associated with filing Form I-945 is 60 \nminutes (1.0 hour) per obligor, including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering the required documentation \nand information, completing the form, preparing statements, attaching necessary documentation, and submitting the \nform.\\829\\ Therefore, using the total rate of compensation of minimum wage of $10.66 per hour, DHS estimates the \nopportunity cost of time for completing and submitting Form I-945 would be $10.66 per applicant.\\830\\ -----------------\n----------------------------------------------------------      \\829\\ Source for immigration bond time burden estimate: \nSupporting Statement, Immigration Bond, ICE Form I-352, (OMB control number 1653-0022).

Therefore, in sum, DHS \nestimates the total cost to file Form I-945 would be at minimum about $34,234 annually.\\831\\ -----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------      \\831\\ Calculation: $35.66 (cost per obligor to file Form I-945) * 960 \n(estimated annual population who would file Form I-945) = $34,233.60 = $34,234 (rounded) annual total cost to file \nForm I-945. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      As noted previously, an obligor (individual \nor a company) or the alien would file Form I-356 as part of a request to cancel a public charge bond. With the \ncreation of Form I-356, DHS proposes to charge a filing fee of $25.00 to request cancellation of a public charge \nbond, which would cover administrative costs of processing the form. DHS estimates the time burden associated \nwith filing Form I-356 is 45 minutes (0.75 hours) per obligor or alien requesting cancellation of a public charge bond, \nincluding the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining data \nneeded, and completing and reviewing the required information. Using the total rate of compensation of minimum \nwage of $10.66 per hour, DHS estimates the opportunity cost of time for completing and submitting Form I-356 \nwould be $8.00 per filer.\\832\\ Therefore, DHS estimates the cost per filer would be $33.00, including $25.00 to file \nForm I-356 and $8.00 per obligor or alien for the opportunity cost of time for completing the form. While the \nproposed public charge bond process would be new and historical data are not available, DHS estimates that \napproximately 25 aliens would request to cancel a public charge bond annually. Therefore, in sum, DHS estimates \nthe total cost to file Form I-356 would be approximately $825 annually.\\833\\ ----------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------      \\832\\ Calculation for opportunity cost of time for completing Form I-356: ($10.66 per hour * \n0.75 hours) = $7.995 = $8.00 (rounded) per applicant.     \\833\\ Calculation: $33.00 (cost per obligor to file Form I-\n356) * 25 (estimated annual population who would file Form I-356) = $825.00 annual total cost to file Form I-356. ---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------      The filing fee for Form I-290B is $675 per obligor wishing \nto file an appeal to challenge the denial of a request to cancel the public charge bond or the breach determination. \nThe fee is set at a level to recover the processing costs to DHS. However, the fee for Form I-290B may be waived \nusing Form I-912 if the party appealing the adverse decision can provide evidence of an inability to pay.\\834\\ In \naddition, DHS estimates the time burden associated with filing Form I-290B is 1 hour and 30 minutes (1.5 hours) \nper obligor, including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering the required documentation and information, \ncompleting the form, preparing statements, attaching necessary documentation, and submitting the form.\\835\\ \nTherefore, using the total rate of compensation of minimum wage of $10.66 per hour, DHS estimates the \nopportunity cost of time for completing Form I-290B would be $15.99 per obligor.\\836\\ ---------------------------------------\n------------------------------------      \\834\\ See 8 CFR 103.7(c).     \\835\\ Source for notice for appeal or motion time \nburden estimate: Supporting Statement for Notice of Appeal or Motion (Form I-290B) (OMB control number 1615-\n0095). The PRA Supporting Statement can be found at Question 12 on Reginfo.gov at            \n\ndiscusses certain indirect impacts that would likely occur as a result of the proposed regulatory changes. These \nindirect impacts are borne by entities that are not specifically regulated by this rule, but may incur costs due to \nchanges in behavior caused by this rule. The primary sources of the reduction in transfer payments from the federal \ngovernment of this proposed rule would be the disenrollment or foregone enrollment of individuals in public benefits \nprograms. The primary sources of the consequences and indirect impacts of the proposed rule would be costs to \nvarious entities that the rule does not directly regulate, such as hospital systems, state agencies, and other \norganizations that provide public assistance to aliens and their households. Indirect costs associated with this rule \ninclude familiarization with the rule for those entities that are not directly regulated but still want to understand the \nchanges in federal and state transfer payments due to this rule.     Moreover, this rule, if finalized, could lead to an \nadditional reduction in transfer payments because some aliens outside the United States who are likely to become \na public charge in the United States would not be admitted and therefore would not receive public benefits in the \nUnited States. For example, CBP could find that an alien arriving at a port of entry seeking admission, either \npursuant to a previously issued visa or as a traveler for whom visa requirements have been waived, is likely to \nbecome a public charge if he or she is admitted. However, DHS is not able to quantify the number of aliens who \nwould possibly be denied admission based on a public charge determination pursuant to this proposed rule, but is \nqualitatively acknowledging this potential impact.     Under the proposed rule, DHS would consider past or current \nreceipt of public benefits, defined in 212.21(b), as identified a heavily weighed factor for purposes of public charge \ndetermination. Earlier in the preamble, DHS provides a list and description of public benefits programs the proposed \nrule identifies for consideration of public charge inadmissibility. Should an individual be found to have received or is \ncurrently receiving certain public benefits identified in the proposed rule, he or she may be found likely to become a \npublic charge. Individuals who might choose to disenroll from or forego future enrollment in a public benefits \nprogram include foreign-born non- citizens as well as U.S. citizens who are members of mixed-status households.     \nTable 49 shows the estimated population of public benefits recipients who are members of households that  [[Page \n51261]]  include foreign-born non-citizens. The table also shows estimates of the number of households with at \nleast 1 foreign-born non-citizen family member that may have received public benefits.\\839,840\\ Based on the \nnumber of households with foreign-born non-citizen family members, DHS estimated the number of public benefits \nrecipients who are members of households that include foreign-born non-citizens that may have received benefits \nusing the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated average household size for foreign-born households.\\841\\ \\842\\ -----------\n----------------------------------------------------------------      \\839\\ See U.S. Census Bureau.

In order to estimate the economic impact of the \nproposed rule, it is necessary to estimate the size of this population. To arrive at the population estimates as shown \nin table 49, DHS first calculated the average annual number of people who received benefits over a 5-year period \nwhenever possible as reported by the benefits granting agencies.\\843\\ However, data for public benefits programs \ndo not identify the nativity status of benefits recipients, i.e., foreign-born or U.S. native. Therefore, DHS estimated \nthe foreign-born non-citizen population by converting the average annual number of benefits recipients using the \nU.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. First, DHS estimated the number of \nhouseholds receiving benefits. Then, DHS estimated the number of households with at least one foreign-born non-\ncitizen receiving benefits based on the percentage of foreign-born non-citizens compared to the total U.S. \npopulation. Finally, the number of public benefits recipients who are members of households that include foreign-\nborn non- citizens receiving benefits was estimated based on the average household size of households with at \nleast one foreign-born individual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\843\\ DHS estimated \nthe annual average number of people who receive public benefits based on 5-year averages generally over the \nperiod fiscal year 2013-2017, including LIS, SNAP, and SSI. DHS calculated 5-year averages over the period fiscal \nyear 2012-2016 for Medicaid and TANF. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      For each of \nthe public benefits programs analyzed, DHS estimated the number of households by dividing the number of people \nthat received public benefits by the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated average household size of 2.64 for the U.S. \ntotal population.\\844\\ According to the U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, the foreign-born non-citizen \npopulation is 6.97 percent of the U.S. total population.\\845\\ While there may be some variation in the percentage of \nforeign-born non- citizens who receive public benefits, including depending on which public benefits program one \nconsiders, DHS assumes in this economic analysis that the percentage holds across the populations of the various \npublic benefits programs. Therefore, to estimate the number of households with at least one foreign-born non-\ncitizen who receives public benefits, DHS multiplied the estimated number of households for each public benefits \nprogram by 6.97 percent. This step may introduce uncertainty into the estimate because the percentage of \nhouseholds with at least one foreign-born non-citizen may be greater or less than the percentage of foreign-born \nnon-citizens in the population. However, if foreign-born non-citizens tend to be grouped together in households, \nthen an overestimation of households that include at least one FBNC is more likely. DHS then estimated the \nnumber of foreign-born non-citizens who received benefits by multiplying the estimated number of households with \nat least one foreign-born non-citizen who receives public benefits by the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated average \nhousehold size of 3.35 for those who are foreign-born.\\846\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-      \\844\\ U.S. Census Bureau American FactFinder Database. ``S0501: Selected Characteristics of the Native and \nForeign-born Populations 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates.'' Available at            \n\nwould allow for refinement of the estimate of the percentage of household members who would be dissuaded from \npublic benefits participation.     DHS anticipates that a number of individuals would be likely to disenroll or forego \nenrollment in a public benefits program as a result of the proposed rule, which would result in a reduction of transfer \npayments from the federal government to such individuals. However, to estimate the economic impact of \ndisenrollment or foregone enrollment from public benefits programs, it is necessary to estimate the average annual \namount of public benefits a person receives for each public benefits program included in this economic analysis. \nTherefore, DHS estimated the average annual benefit received per person for each public benefit program in table \n50. The average benefit per person is calculated for each public benefit program by dividing the average annual \nprogram payments for on public benefits by the average annual total number of recipients.\\847\\ To the extent that \ndata are available, these estimates are based on 5-year averages. ----------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------      \\847\\ DHS notes that the amounts presented may not account for overhead costs associated with \nadministering each of these public benefits programs. The costs presented are based on amounts recipients have \nreceived in benefits as reported by benefits- granting agencies.  --------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------  [[Page 51265]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.077   [[Page 51266]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] \nTP10OC18.078      Research shows that when eligibility rules change for public benefits programs there is evidence \nof a ``chilling effect'' that discourages immigrants from using public benefits programs for which they are still \neligible. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a study shortly after the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 (PRWORA) took effect and found that the number of people \nreceiving food stamps fell by over 5.9 million between summer 1994 and summer 1997.\\848\\ The study notes that \nenrollment in the food stamps program was falling during this period, possibly due to strong economic growth, but \nthe decline in enrollment was steepest among legal immigrants. Under PRWORA, legal immigrants were facing \nsignificantly stronger restrictions through which most would become ineligible to receive food stamps. The study \nalso found that enrollment of legal immigrants in the food stamps program fell by 54 percent. Moreover, another \nstudy found evidence of a ``chilling effect'' due to enactment of PRWORA where non-citizen enrollment in public \nbenefits programs declined more steeply than U.S. citizen enrollment over the period 1994 to 1997.\\849\\ Overall, \nthe study found that welfare enrollment in households headed by foreign- born individuals fell by about 21 percent. -\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\848\\ See Genser, J.

The table also presents the previously estimated \naverage annual benefit per person who received benefits for each of the public benefits programs.\\854\\ This \nproposed rule would result in a reduction of transfer payments from the federal government to those foreign-born \nnon-citizens and associated household members who choose to disenroll from or forego future enrollment in a \npublic benefits program. Transfer payments are payments from one group to another that do not directly affect total \nresources available to society.\\855\\ DHS estimates the total annual reduction in transfer payments paid by the \nfederal government to individuals who may choose to disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefits \nprograms is approximately $1.51 billion for an estimated 324,438 individuals and 14,532 households across the \npublic benefits programs examined. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\854\\ As previously \nnoted, the average annual benefits per person amounts presented may not account for overhead costs associated \nwith administering each of these public benefits programs since they are based on amounts recipients have \nreceived in benefits as reported by benefits-granting agencies. Therefore, the costs presented may underestimate \nthe total amount of transfer payments to the federal government.     \\855\\ See Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB). Circular A-4.

See also USDA, FNS Handbook 901, p. 41 \navailable at:            https://fns-\nprod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/apd/FNS_HB901_v2.2_internet_Ready_Format.pdf. ---------------------------------\n------------------------------------------      However, the rate of disenrollment or foregone enrollment may result in an \nunderestimate, to the extent that covered aliens may choose to disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefits \nprograms sooner than in the same year that the alien applies for adjustment of status. For instance, because DHS \nwould consider past receipt of public benefits within at least 36 months as a heavily weighed factor under the \nproposed rule, prospective adjustment applicants may choose to disenroll or forego enrollment at least 36 months \nin advance of such application. Some aliens and members of their households may adjust their behavior in \nanticipation of eventually applying for adjustment of status, but not know exactly when they will submit such \napplications. In addition, because the proposed rule also affects inadmissibility determinations in contexts aside \nfrom adjustment of status, some percentage of the alien population is likely to disenroll from or forego enrollment in \ncovered programs, for such non-adjustment-related purposes as well.     On the other hand, the 2.5 percent rate of \ndisenrollment or foregone enrollment estimate may result in an overestimate, insofar as it does not correct for those \ncategories of aliens (such as asylees and refugees) that are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility \nand assumes 100% are using public benefits which may not be true. DHS expects that the rule's effects on public \nbenefit program enrollment and disenrollment by such categories of aliens and their households would be less \npronounced. Additionally, some prospective adjustment applicants and associated household members may not \nchoose to disenroll or forego public benefits because they may have other factors that counterbalance acceptance \nof public benefits when looked at in the totality of circumstances. DHS welcomes comments on the appropriate \nmethodology for estimating the rate of disenrollment or foregone enrollment, including ways to improve upon the \nDHS methodology. DHS welcomes public comments on the estimation of the disenrollment or foregone enrollment \nrate used in this analysis.     However, in order to examine the impact if prospective adjustment applicants chose to \ndisenroll or forego enrollment in public benefits at least 36 months in advance, DHS conducted a sensitivity analysis \nbased on this issue of the proximity of time to a review of public charge inadmissibility. In such cases, DHS would \nconsider past receipt of public benefits within at least 36 months (3 years) as a heavily weighed negative factor \nunder the proposed rule and that a prospective adjustment applicant may choose to disenroll or forego enrollment \nfor at least 36 months in advance of such application. Table 53 presents the potential range of the population who \nmay disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefits programs as well as the potential total reduction in \ntransfer payments paid by the federal government to this population. DHS estimates that the population range of \nforeign-born non-citizens who may disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefits programs would range from \napproximately 333,239 to 999,717. In addition, the estimated reduction in transfer payments paid by the federal \ngovernment to this population ranges from about $1.51 billion to $4.53 billion. For this economic analysis, the \nprimary estimate upon which DHS bases its analysis is the 1-year estimate, as shown below in the table. However, \nDHS welcomes the public to comment on DHS's use of the 1-year estimate as its primary estimate as well as \nwhether using the 3-years estimate is a more appropriate estimate to use as the primary estimate. [GRAPHIC] \n[TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.081      DHS presents this range since it is possible that the number of people who \nmay disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefits programs in one year could be as many as the combined \nthree-year total of people who may disenroll or forego enrollment. Because DHS plans to heavily weigh the receipt \nof public benefits within the past 36 months as a negative factor, individuals may begin to disenroll or forego \nenrollment in public benefits programs as early as three years prior to applying for adjustment of status. As a result, \nthe annual reduction in transfer payments could range between the three estimates presented in table 53.     \nAnother source of impacts of the proposed rule would be costs to various individuals and other entities associated \nwith familiarization with the provisions  [[Page 51270]]  of the rule. Familiarization costs involve the time spent \nreading the details of a rule to understand its changes. A foreign-born non-citizen (such as those contemplating \ndisenrollment or foregoing enrollment in a public benefits program) might review the rule to determine whether they \nare subject to the provisions of the proposed rule. To the extent an individual or entity that is directly regulated by \nthe rule incurs familiarization costs, those familiarization costs are a direct cost of the rule. In addition to those being \ndirectly regulated by the rule, a wide variety of other entities would likely choose to read the rule and also incur \nfamiliarization costs. For example, immigration lawyers, immigration advocacy groups, health care providers of all \ntypes, non- profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and religious organizations, among others, may \nwant to become familiar with the provisions of this proposed rule. DHS believes such non-profit organizations and \n\n\nother advocacy groups might choose to read the rule in order to provide information to those foreign-born non-\ncitizens and associated households that might be impacted by a reduction in federal transfer payments. \nFamiliarization costs incurred by those not directly regulated are indirect costs. DHS estimates the time that would \nbe necessary to read the rule would be approximately 8 to 10 hours per person, resulting in opportunity costs of \ntime. An entity, such as a non-profit or advocacy group, may have more than one person who reads the rule.     In \naddition, the proposed rule may impose costs that DHS is unable to quantify. Many federal agencies, such as \nUSDA in administering the SNAP program, may need to update and re-write guidance documents or would need to \nupdate forms used. Moreover, there may be additional unquantified costs that state and local government may incur \nassociated with similar activities. At each level of government, it will also be necessary to prepare training materials \nand retrain staff. Such changes will require staff time and have associated costs.     There are a number of \nconsequences that could occur because of follow-on effects of the reduction in transfer payments identified in the \nproposed rule. DHS is providing a listing of the primary non- monetized potential consequences of the proposed \nrule below. Disenrollment or foregoing enrollment in public benefits program by aliens otherwise eligible for these \nprograms could lead to:      Worse health outcomes, including increased prevalence of obesity and malnutrition, \nespecially for pregnant or breastfeeding women, infants, or children, and reduced prescription adherence;      \nIncreased use of emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of primary health care due to delayed \ntreatment;      Increased prevalence of communicable diseases, including among members of the U.S. citizen \npopulation who are not vaccinated;      Increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid \nfor by an insurer or patient; and      Increased rates of poverty and housing instability; and      Reduced productivity \nand educational attainment.     DHS notes that the proposed rule is likely to produce various other unanticipated \nconsequences and indirect costs. For example, community based organizations, including small organizations, may \nprovide charitable assistance, such as food or housing assistance, for individuals who forego enrollment in public \nbenefit programs. DHS requests comments on other possible consequences of the rule and appropriate \nmethodologies for quantifying these non-monetized potential impacts. (d) Discounted Direct Costs and Reduced \nTransfer Payments     To compare costs over time, DHS applied a 3 percent and a 7 percent discount rate to the \ntotal estimated costs associated with the proposed rule. Table 54 presents a summary of the quantified direct costs \nand reduced transfer payments from the federal government included in the proposed rule. The summary table \npresents costs in undiscounted dollars as well as dollars discounted at 3 percent and 7 percent rates over a 10-year \nperiod. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.082   [[Page 51271]]     i. Discounted Direct Costs      DHS \npresents the total estimated costs for filing Form I-944 as part of the review for determination of inadmissibility \nbased on public charge when applying for adjustment of status and the opportunity cost of time associated with the \nincreased time burden estimate for completing Forms I-485, I-129, I-129CW, and I-539. See table 55. The total \nestimated costs are presented in undiscounted dollars, at a 3 percent discount rate, and at a 7 percent discount \nrate.  [[Page 51272]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.083   [[Page 51273]]   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] \nTP10OC18.084      Over the first 10 years of implementation, DHS estimates the quantified direct costs of the \nproposed rule would range from about $453,134,220 to $1,295,968,450 (undiscounted). In addition, DHS estimates \nthat the 10-year discounted cost of this proposed rule to individuals applying to adjust status who would be required \nto undergo review for determination of inadmissibility based on public charge would range from about $386,532,679 \nto $1,105,487,375 at a 3 percent discount rate and about $318,262,513 to $910,234,008 at a 7 percent discount \nrate.     This economic analysis presents the quantified costs of this proposed rule based on the estimated \npopulation applying to adjust status subject to review for public charge determination and the opportunity cost of \ntime associated with the increased time burden estimates for completing Forms I-485, I-129, I-129CW, and I-539. \nThe economic analysis also presents the quantified costs associated with the proposed public charge bond \nprocess, including costs associated with completing and filing Forms I-945 and I-356. DHS reiterates we are unable \nto estimate the actual number of Form I-129 or Form I-129CW petitioners and Form I-539 filers that adjudication \nofficers would require through a RFE to submit Form I-944 since such RFE would be issued on a discretionary \nbasis as outlined in the proposed rule. However, previously in this economic analysis, DHS presented a more \ndetailed range of RFEs that could be issued based on total population estimates and the estimated annual cost \nassociated with such RFEs. DHS welcomes any public comments on the discounted costs presented in this \nproposed rule.  ii. Discounted Reduction in Transfer Payments      DHS presents the total estimated quantified \nreduction in transfer payments from the federal government of the proposed rule in table 56. The total estimated \ncosts are presented in undiscounted dollars, at a 3 percent discount rate, and at a 7 percent discount rate. \n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP10OC18.085   [[Page 51274]]       Over the first 10 years of implementation, DHS \n\n\n\nestimates the total quantified reduction in transfer payments from the federal government to foreign-born non-\ncitizens and their households would be about $22.7 billion (undiscounted). In addition, DHS estimates that the 10-\nyear discounted costs of this proposed rule would be approximately $19.3 billion at a 3 percent discount rate and \nabout $15.9 billion at a 7 percent discount rate due to disenrollment or foregone enrollment in various federal public \nbenefits programs. In addition, DHS assumes that the state share of federal financial participation (FFP) is 50 \npercent and therefore the 10-year discounted amount of the state-level share of transfer payments of this proposed \nrule would be approximately $9.65 billion at a 3 percent discount rate and about $7.95 billion at a 7 percent discount \nrate. Disenrollment or foregone enrollment in public benefits programs could occur whether or not such immigrants \nare directly affected by the provisions of the proposed rule, however, USCIS was unable to determine the exact \npercentage of individuals who would disenroll or forego enrollment. DHS notes that there may be a number of \nadditional sources of transfer payments that could result from the proposed rule that DHS is not able to estimate \nand quantify at this time. Therefore, DHS welcomes public comments on additional sources of transfer payments \nthat could result from the proposed rule. (e) Costs to the Federal Government     The INA provides for the collection \nof fees at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing adjudication and naturalization services, \nincluding administrative costs and services provided without charge to certain applicants and petitioners. See INA \nsection 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m). DHS notes that USCIS establishes its fees by assigning costs to an adjudication \nbased on its relative adjudication burden and use of USCIS resources. Fees are established at an amount that is \nnecessary to recover these assigned costs such as clerical, officers, and managerial salaries and benefits, plus an \namount to recover unassigned overhead (e.g., facility rent, IT equipment and systems among other expenses) and \nimmigration benefits provided without a fee charge. Consequently, since USCIS immigration fees are based on \nresource expenditures related to the benefit in question, USCIS uses the fee associated with an information \ncollection as a reasonable measure of the collection's costs to USCIS. Therefore, DHS has established the fee for \nthe adjudication of Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status; Form I- 129, Petition \nfor a Nonimmigrant Worker; Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker; and Form \nI-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status in accordance with this requirement. Other forms \naffected by this proposed rule do not currently charge a filing fee, including Form I-693, Medical Examination and \nVaccination Record; Affidavit of Support forms (Form I- 864, Form I-864A, Form I-864EZ, and I-864W); Form I-912, \nRequest for Fee Waiver, and Form I-407, Record of Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status. DHS \nnotes that the time necessary for USCIS to review the information submitted with each of these forms includes the \ntime to adjudicate the underlying benefit request. While each of these forms does not charge a fee, the cost to \nUSCIS is captured in the fee for the underlying benefit request form. DHS welcomes public comments on costs to \nthe government from this proposed rule. (f) Benefits of Proposed Regulatory Changes     The primary benefit of the \nproposed rule would be to better ensure that aliens who are admitted to the United States or apply for adjustment of \nstatus would not receive one or more public benefits as defined in the proposed 212.21(b) and instead, will rely on \ntheir financial resource, and those of family members, sponsors, and private organizations. As a result, DHS is \nestablishing a more formal review process and improving the current review process to standardize the \ndetermination of inadmissibility based on public charge grounds. The proposed process would also help clarify to \napplicants the specific criteria that would be considered as inadmissible under public charge determinations.     \nDHS anticipates that the proposed rule would produce some benefits from the elimination of Form I-864W for use in \nfiling an affidavit of support. The information previously requested on the Form I-864W would now be captured \nusing Form I-485. Applicants, therefore, would not be required to file a form separate from the Form I-485. As noted \npreviously, there is no filing fee associated with filing Form I-864W, but DHS estimates the time burden associated \nwith filing this form is 60 minutes (1 hour) per petitioner.\\858\\ Therefore, using the average total rate of \ncompensation of $35.78 per hour, DHS estimates the amount of benefits that would accrue from eliminating Form I-\n864W would be $35.78 per petitioner, which equals the opportunity cost of time for completing Form I-864W.\\859\\ \nHowever, DHS notes that we are unable to determine the annual number filings of Form I-864W since we do not \ncurrently have information of how many of these filings are based on public charge determinations. ----------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------      \\858\\ Source for I-864W time burden estimate: Paperwork Reduction \nAct (PRA) Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Forms I-864, I-864A, I-864EZ, I-864W) (OMB control \nnumber 1615- 0075). The PRA Supporting Statement can be found at Question 12 on Reginfo.gov at            \n\nprocess, despite the costs associated with this process, would potentially allow an immigrant the opportunity to be \nadmitted although he or she was deemed likely to become a public charge. DHS welcomes any public comments \non the benefits of this proposed rule.  B. Regulatory Flexibility Act      The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 \nU.S.C. 601-612, as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, Public Law \n104-121 (March 29, 1996), requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small \nbusinesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small organizations during the development of their rules. The \nterm ``small entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and \noperated and are not dominant in their fields, or governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than \n50,000.\\860\\ This proposed rule would require an individual applying for a visa, seeking admission at the port of \nentry, or adjusting status to establish that he or she is not likely at any time to become a public charge. Most of this \nrule's proposed changes do not fall under the RFA because they directly regulate individuals who are not, for \npurposes of the RFA, within the definition of small entities established by 5 U.S.C. 601(6). However, DHS \nrecognizes that there may be some provisions of this proposed rule that would directly regulate small entities, and, \ntherefore,  [[Page 51275]]  DHS has examined the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. -------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------      \\860\\ A small business is defined as any independently owned and \noperated business not dominant in its field that qualifies as a small business per the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. \n632. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      This proposed rule would increase the time \nburden by an additional 30 minutes on petitioners who file Form I-129 or Form I-129CW on behalf of a beneficiary \nrequesting an extension of stay or change of status, which would impose direct costs on these petitioners. \nAdditionally, the proposed provisions to establish a public charge bond process included in this proposed rule would \nallow for either an alien or an obligor (individual or an entity) to request a cancellation of a public bond. As a result, \nthis proposed rule could have direct impacts on small entities that are obligors. DHS also recognizes that a Form I-\n129 or Form I-129CW beneficiary, for whom a Form I-129 or Form I-129CW petitioner (i.e., the employer) sought \neither an extension of stay or a change of status, may have to leave the U.S. if the employer's request was denied. \nIn these cases, the petitioner may lose the beneficiary as an employee and may incur labor turnover costs. DHS \npresents this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) to examine these impacts. Initial Regulatory Flexibility \nAnalysis     The small entities that could be impacted by this proposed rule are petitioners who file Form I-129 or \nForm I-129CW on behalf of beneficiaries requesting an extension of stay or change of status as well as obligors \nthat would request a cancellation of a public bond.     1. A description of the reasons why the action by the agency \nis being considered.     DHS seeks to better ensure that applicants for admission to the United States and \napplicants for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident who are subject to the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility are self-sufficient, i.e., they will rely on their own financial resources as well as the financial resources \nof their family, sponsors, and private organizations as necessary.\\861\\ Under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), an alien is inadmissible if, at the time of an application for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status, he \nor she is likely at any time to become a public charge. The statute requires DHS to consider the following minimum \nfactors that reflect the likelihood that an alien will become a public charge: The alien's age; health; family status; \nassets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills. In addition, DHS may consider any affidavit of \nsupport submitted by the alien's sponsor and any other factors relevant to the likelihood of the alien becoming a \npublic charge. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\861\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1601(2). ----------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------      2. A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the \nproposed rule.     DHS objectives and legal authority for this proposed rule are discussed in the preamble of the \nproposed rule.     3. A description and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to which the \nproposed changes would apply.     This proposed rule would increase the time burden by an additional 30 minutes \non petitioners who file Form I-129 or Form I-129CW on behalf of a beneficiary requesting an extension of stay or \nchange of status, which would impose direct costs on these petitioners and entities.\\862\\ As previously discussed in \nthe E.O. 12866 section of this NPRM, DHS estimates an annual population of 336,335 beneficiaries seeking \nextension of stay or change of status through a petitioning employer using Form I-129. In addition, DHS estimates \nan annual population of 6,307 beneficiaries seeking extension of stay or change of status through a petitioning \nemployer using Form I-129CW. DHS estimates that the 30-minute increase in the estimated time burden for these \npopulations would increase the opportunity cost of time for completing and filing Form I-129 and Form I-129CW and \nwould result in about $184 million and about $5 million in costs, respectively. For this population, DHS is unable to \nestimate the actual number of requests for evidence (RFEs) that adjudication officers may issue to Form I-129 \nbeneficiaries to complete Form I-944 to provide evidence that they are not likely to become a public charge when \n\n\n\nthey are extending stay or changing status. Therefore, DHS cannot determine the number of small entities that \nmight be impacted by potential requests to complete the Form I-944 as part of an RFE. -------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------      \\862\\ In the context of Form I-129, a petitioner is typically an employer or the \nrepresentative of an employer who files on behalf of a nonimmigrant worker (or beneficiary) to come to the United \nStates temporarily to perform services or labor, or to receive training. See            https://www.uscis.gov/i-129. --------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------      The proposed provisions on the bond process included in this \nrule would allow a surety company to become an obligor on a public charge bond (proposed Form I-945) and, later, \nto request a cancellation of such a bond (proposed Form I-356). Therefore, this proposed rule could have some \nimpacts to surety companies, some of which are small entities. A request for cancellation of a public bond using \nForm I-356 includes a time burden of 15 minutes per request and a fee to DHS of $25.00. It is not known the \nnumber of surety bond companies that might complete and file Forms I-945 and I-356 due to a lack of historical \ndata and uncertainty in the number individuals that may be granted the opportunity to post for public charge bond. \nHowever, DHS estimates that the filing volume for Form I-945 might be about 960 and the filing volume for Form I-\n356 might be approximately 25. While DHS cannot predict the exact number of surety companies that might be \nimpacted by this proposed rule, nine out of 273 Treasury-certified surety companies in fiscal year 2015 posted new \nimmigration bonds with DHS ICE.\\863\\ DHS found that of the nine surety companies, four entities were considered \n``small'' based on the number of employees or revenue being less than their respective Small Business \nAdministration size standard.\\864\\ Assuming these nine surety companies post public charge bonds with USCIS, \nwe can assume that four surety companies may be considered as small entities. However, USCIS cannot predict \nthe exact impact to these small entities at this time. We expect that obligors would be able to pass along the costs \nof this rulemaking to the aliens. DHS welcomes any public comments or data on the number of small entities that \nwould be surety companies likely to post public charge bonds and any direct impacts on those small surety \ncompanies. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\863\\ See DHS, Procedures and Standards \nfor Declining Surety Immigration Bonds and Administrative Appeal Requirement for Breaches NPRM, 83 FR \n25951, 25962-25965 (June 5, 2018).     \\864\\ U.S. Small Business Administration, Table of Small Business Size \nStandards Matched to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes, February 26, 2016.            \n\nincluding pursuant to other means. DHS welcomes any public comments or data on the impact to the petitioners or \nemployers of Form I-129 or Form I-129CW beneficiaries who are denied an extension of stay or change of status \ndue to public charge inadmissibility.     DHS does not believe that it would be necessary for Form I-129 or Form I-\n129CW petitioners, or for surety bond companies (obligors) to acquire additional types of professional skills as a \nresult of this proposed rule. These petitioners and obligors should already possess the expertise to fill out the \nassociated forms for this proposed rule. Additionally, these petitioners and obligors would be familiar with the \nproposed rule and such familiarization costs are accounted for the in the E.O. 12866 sections.     5. An identification \nof all relevant Federal rules, to the extent practical, that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule.     \nDHS is unaware of any duplicative, overlapping, or conflicting Federal rules, but invites any public comment and \ninformation regarding any such rules. Elsewhere in the preamble to the proposed rule, DHS addresses the \nrelationship between this proposed rule and the standards governing alien eligibility for public benefits, as outlined \nin PRWORA.     6. Description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule that accomplish the stated \nobjectives of applicable statutes and that minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small \nentities.     DHS considered a range of potential alternatives to the proposed rule. First, under a ``no action'' \nalternative, DHS would continue administering the public charge ground of inadmissibility under the 1999 Guidance. \nFor reasons explained more fully elsewhere in the preamble to the proposed rule, DHS determined that this \nalternative would not adequately ensure the self-sufficiency of aliens subject to the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility. Second, DHS considered including a more expansive definition of ``public benefit,'' potentially to \ninclude a range of non-cash benefit programs falling in specific categories (such as programs that provide \nassistance for basic food and nutrition, housing, and medical care). For reasons explained more fully elsewhere in \nthe preamble to the proposed rule, DHS chose the approach contained in this proposed rule--a more limited list of \nhigh-expenditure non-cash benefits. DHS expects that, as compared to the broader alternative, the proposed \napproach may reduce the overall effect of the rule on transfers, but enhance its administrability and predictability. \nEmployers filing Form I-129 and surety companies would have a better understanding of the types of non-cash \nbenefits that may be covered under this proposed rule than they would under the broader alternative, and may \nrealize cost savings as a result. In addition, certain indirect effects of the rule may be different as a result of the \ndecision to reject this alternative.  C. Congressional Review Act      This proposed rule is a major rule as defined by \n5 U.S.C. 804, also known as the ``Congressional Review Act,'' as enacted in section 251 of the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, Public Law 104-121, 110 Stat. 847, 868 et seq. Accordingly, this \nrule, if enacted as a final rule, would be effective at least 60 days after the date on which Congress receives a \nreport submitted by DHS under the Congressional Review Act, or 60 days after the final rule's publication, \nwhichever is later.  D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) is \nintended, among other things, to curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on State, local, and \ntribal governments. Title II of UMRA requires each Federal agency to prepare a written statement assessing the \neffects of any Federal mandate in a proposed or final agency rule that may directly result in a $100 million or more \nexpenditure (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year by State, local, and tribal governments, in the \naggregate, or by the private sector. The inflation-adjusted value of $100 million in 1995 is approximately $161 \nmillion in 2017 based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.\\867\\ -------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------      \\867\\ U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Historical Consumer Price Index for All Urban \nConsumers (CPI-U): U.S. City Average, All Items, available at            https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/historical-cpi-u-\n201712.pdf (last visited Jan. 31, 2018). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      This proposed \nrule does not contain such a mandate. The requirements of Title II of UMRA, therefore, do not apply, and DHS has \nnot prepared a statement under UMRA.  E. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism)      This rule will not have \nsubstantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on \nthe distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. DHS does not expect that this \nproposed rule would impose substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments, or preempt State \nlaw. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have \nsufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact statement.  F. \nExecutive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform)      This rule meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) \nand 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988.  G. Executive Order 13175 Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments      This proposed rule does not have tribal implications under Executive  [[Page 51277]]  Order \n13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it would not have a substantial \ndirect effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or \n\n\non the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.  H. Family \nAssessment      DHS has reviewed this proposed rule in line with the requirements of section 654 of the Treasury \nGeneral Appropriations Act, 1999, Public Law 105-277. With respect to the criteria specified in section 654(c)(1), \nDHS has determined that the proposed rule may decrease disposable income and increase the poverty of certain \nfamilies and children, including U.S. citizen children. For the reasons stated elsewhere in this preamble, however, \nDHS has determined that the benefits of the action justify the financial impact on the family. Further, the proposed \naction would expand the list of public benefits that DHS may consider for purposes of inadmissibility under section \n212(a)(4) of the Act. As a result, the proposed regulatory action, if finalized, may increase the number of aliens \nfound inadmissible under section 212(a)(4) of the Act. As described under the Supplementary Information section of \nthis rule, DHS has compelling legal and policy reasons for the proposed regulatory action, including, but not limited \nto, better ensuring the self-sufficiency of aliens admitted or immigrating to the United States, and minimizing the \nfinancial burden of aliens on the U.S. social safety net.  I. National Environmental Policy Act      DHS analyzes \nactions to determine whether NEPA applies to them and if so what degree of analysis is required. DHS Directive \n(Dir) 023-01 Rev. 01 and Instruction (Inst.) 023-01-001 rev. 01 establish the procedures that DHS and its \ncomponents use to comply with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for \nimplementing NEPA, 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508. The CEQ regulations allow federal agencies to establish, \nwith CEQ review and concurrence, categories of actions (``categorical exclusions'') which experience has shown do \nnot individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and, therefore, do not require an \nEnvironmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). 40 CFR 1507.3(b)(1)(iii), 1508.4. DHS \nInstruction 023-01-001 Rev. 01 establishes such Categorical Exclusions that DHS has found to have no such effect. \nInst. 023-01-001 Rev. 01 Appendix A Table 1. For an action to be categorically excluded, DHS Inst. 023-01-001 \nRev. 01 requires the action to satisfy each of the following three conditions: (1) The entire action clearly fits within \none or more of the Categorical Exclusions; (2) the action is not a piece of a larger action; and (3) no extraordinary \ncircumstances exist that create the potential for a significant environmental effect. Inst. 023-01-001 Rev. 01 section \nV.B(1)-(3).     DHS analyzed this action and has concluded that NEPA does not apply due to the excessively \nspeculative nature of any effort to conduct an impact analysis. Nevertheless, if NEPA did apply to this action, the \naction clearly would come within our categorical exclusion A.3(d) as set forth in DHS Inst. 023-01-001 Rev. 01, \nAppendix A, Table 1.     This proposed rule applies to applicants for admission or adjustment of status, as long as \nthe individual is applying for an immigration status that is subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility. In \naddition, the proposed rule would potentially affect individuals applying for an extension of stay or change of status \nbecause these individuals would have to demonstrate that they are neither receiving, nor likely to receive, public \nbenefits as defined in the proposed rule. As discussed in detail above, this rule proposes to establish a definition of \npublic charge and expand the types of public benefits that DHS would consider as part of its public charge \ninadmissibility determinations. The rule also proposes to establish a regulatory framework based on the statutory \nfactors that must be considered in public charge determinations, including enhanced evidentiary requirements for \npublic charge inadmissibility determinations by USCIS. Finally, the rule proposes to revise the public charge bond \nprocess. Overall, the proposed regulatory changes, if finalized, would require a more in-depth adjudication of public \ncharge issues and have the potential to result in more findings of inadmissibility, ineligibility for adjustment of status, \nor denials of requests for extension of stay or change of status, on public charge grounds.     Historically, there is a \nhigh demand for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. Even if larger numbers of aliens were now found to be \ninadmissible on public charge grounds as a result of this rule, there may be some replacement effect from others \nwho would, in turn, be considered for the existing visas. Therefore, DHS cannot estimate with any degree of \ncertainty to what extent the potential for increased findings of inadmissibility on public charge grounds would result \nin fewer individuals being admitted to the United States. DHS is also unable to estimate with any degree of certainty \nwhether the proposed rule would result in increased denial of applications for extension of stay or change of status. \nDHS does not, however, anticipate that this proposed rule will cause an increase in the number of individuals found \nto be admissible, or eligible for an extension of stay, or adjustment or change of status. Even if DHS could estimate \nthese numerical effects, any assessment of derivative environmental effect at the national level would remain \nunduly speculative.     This rule is not part of a larger action and presents no extraordinary circumstances creating \nthe potential for significant environmental effects. Therefore, if NEPA were determined to apply, this rule would be \ncategorically excluded from further NEPA review.  J. Paperwork Reduction Act      Under the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1995, Public Law 104-13, agencies are required to submit to OMB, for review and approval, any reporting \nrequirements inherent in a rule. Table 57 shows the summary of forms that are part of this rulemaking.

In accordance \nwith the PRA, the information collection notice is published in the Federal Register to obtain comments regarding \nthe proposed edits to the information collection instrument.     Comments are encouraged and will be accepted for \n60 days from the publication date of the proposed rule. All submissions received must include the OMB Control \nNumber 1615-NEW in the body of the letter and the agency name. To avoid duplicate submissions, please use only \none of the methods under the ADDRESSES and I. Public Participation section of this rule to submit comments. \nComments on this information collection should address one or more of the following four points:     1. Evaluate \nwhether the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, \nincluding whether the information will have practical utility;     2. Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of \nthe burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;     3. \nEnhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and     4. Minimize the burden of the \ncollection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, \nelectronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., \npermitting electronic submission of responses.     Overview of information collection:     1. Type of Information \nCollection: New Collection.     2. Title of the Form/Collection: Declaration of Self-Sufficiency and Public Benefits \nWorksheet.     3. Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the DHS sponsoring the collection: \nForm I-944; USCIS.     4. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as well as a brief abstract: \nPrimary: Individuals or households. USCIS will require an individual applying to adjust status to lawful permanent \nresidence (Form I-485) and who is subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility to file Form I-944. On a \ncase by case basis, USCIS may request that a nonimmigrant seeking to extend stay or change status (Form I-539 \nor Form I-129) and persons filing USCIS Form I-129CW to file Form I-944. The data collected on these forms will be \nused by USCIS to determine the likelihood of a declarant becoming a public charge based on the factors regarding \nhealth; family status; assets, resource, and financial status; and education and skills. The forms serve the purpose \nof standardizing public charge evaluation metrics and ensure that declarants provide all essential information \nrequired for USCIS to assess self-sufficiency and adjudicate the declaration. If USCIS determines that a declarant \nis likely to become a public charge, the declarant may need to provide additional resources or evidence to \novercome this determination.     5. An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of time \nestimated for an average respondent to respond: The estimated total number of respondents for the information \ncollection Form I-944 is 382,264 and  [[Page 51285]]  the estimated hour burden per response is 4 hours.     6.

Overview of Information Collection     1. Type of Information \nCollection: Revision of a Currently Approved Collection.     2. Title of the Form/Collection: Affidavit of Support Under \nSection 213A of the INA; Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member; Affidavit of Support under Section \n213 of the Act.     3. Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the DHS sponsoring the \ncollection: I-864; I-864A; I-864EZ; USCIS.     4. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as well as \na brief abstract: Primary: Individuals or households. Form I- 864: USCIS uses the data collected on Form I-864 to \ndetermine whether the sponsor has the ability to support the sponsored alien under section 213A of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act. This form standardizes evaluation of a sponsor's ability to support the sponsored \nalien and ensures that basic information required to assess eligibility is provided by petitioners.     Form I-864A: \nForm I-864A is a contract between the sponsor and the sponsor's household members. It is only required if the \nsponsor used income of his or her household members to reach the required 125 percent of the FPG. The contract \nholds these household members jointly and severally liable for the support of the sponsored immigrant.  [[Page \n51286]]  The information collection required on Form I-864A is necessary for public benefit agencies to enforce the \nAffidavit of Support in the event the sponsor used income of his or her household members to reach the required \nincome level and the public benefit agencies are requesting reimbursement from the sponsor.     Form I-864EZ: \nUSCIS uses Form I-864EZ in exactly the same way as Form I-864; however, USCIS collects less information from \nthe sponsors as less information is needed from those who qualify in order to make a thorough adjudication.     5. \nAn estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of time estimated for an average respondent to \nrespond: The estimated total number of respondents for the information collection I-864 is 453,345 and the \nestimated hour burden per response is 6 hours; the estimated total number of respondents for the information \ncollection I- 864A is 215,800 and the estimated hour burden per response is 1.75 hours; the estimated total number \nof respondents for the information collection I-864EZ is 100,000 and the estimated hour burden per response is 2.5 \nhours.     6. An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated with the collection: The total estimated \n\n\n\nannual hour burden associated with this collection is 3,347,720 hours.     7. An estimate of the total public burden \n(in cost) associated with the collection: The estimated total annual cost burden associated with this collection of \ninformation is $135,569,525. USCIS Form I-912     Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13, \nall agencies are required to submit to OMB, for review and approval, any reporting requirements inherent in a rule. \nAlthough this rule does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the PRA, this rule will \nrequire non-substantive edits to USCIS Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver. These edits make clear to those who \nrequest fee waivers that an approved fee waiver can negatively impact eligibility for an immigration benefit that is \nsubject to the public charge inadmissibility determination. Accordingly, USCIS has submitted a Paperwork \nReduction Act Change Worksheet, Form OMB 83-C, and amended information collection instruments to OMB for \nreview and approval in accordance with the PRA. USCIS Form I-945     Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1995, Public Law 104-13, all agencies are required to submit to OMB, for review and approval, any reporting \nrequirements inherent in a rule.

Affected public who \nwill be asked or required to respond, as well as a brief abstract: Primary: Business or other for-profit. In certain \ninstances, a bond can be posted on behalf of the alien to guarantee a set of conditions set by the government \nconcerning an alien, i.e. that the alien will not become a public charge as defined in proposed 8 CFR 212.21(a) \nbecause he or she will not receive public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 213.21(b) after the alien's adjustment of \nstatus to that of a lawful permanent resident. An acceptable surety is generally any company listed on the \nDepartment of the Treasury's Listing of Approved Sureties (Department Circular 570) in effect on the date the bond \nis requested or an individual or an entity that deposits cash or a cash equivalent, such as a cashier's check or \nmoney order for the full value of the bond.\\868\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \\868\\ \nSee 8 CFR 103.6(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      5. An estimate of the total number \nof respondents and the amount of time estimated for an average respondent to respond: The estimated total \nnumber of respondents for the information collection (Enter form number) is 960 and the estimated hour burden per \nresponse is 1 hour.     6. An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated with the collection: The total \nestimated annual hour burden associated with this collection is 960 hours. (Multiply the burden for each submission \nby the number of respondents.)     7. An estimate of the total public burden (in cost) associated with the collection: \nThe estimated total annual cost burden associated with this collection of information is $0 as the company \nperforming the bond service receives a fee.

Sec.  212.22  Public \nCharge inadmissibility determination.      This section relates to the public charge ground of inadmissibility under \nsection 212(a)(4) of the Act.     (a) Prospective determination based on the totality of circumstances. The \ndetermination of an alien's likelihood of becoming a public charge must be based on the totality of the alien's \ncircumstances by weighing all factors that make the alien more or less likely at any time in the future to become a \npublic charge, as outlined in this section.     (b) Minimum factors to consider. A public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination must entail consideration of the alien's age; health; family status; education and skills; and assets, \nresources, and financial status, as follows:     (1) The alien's age--(i) Standard. When considering an alien's age, \nDHS will consider whether the alien is between the age of 18 and the minimum ``early retirement age'' for Social \nSecurity set forth in 42 U.S.C. 416(l)(2), and whether the alien's age otherwise makes the alien more or less likely \nto become a public charge, such as by impacting the alien's ability to work.     (ii) [Reserved]     (2) The alien's \nhealth--(i) Standard. DHS will consider whether the alien's health makes the alien more or less likely to become a \npublic charge, including whether the alien has been diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require \nextensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere with the alien's ability to provide and care for \nhim- or herself, to attend school, or to work upon admission or adjustment of status.     (ii) Evidence. USCIS' \nconsideration includes but is not limited to the following:     (A) A report of an immigration medical examination \nperformed by a civil surgeon or panel physician where such examination is required; or     (B) Evidence of a medical \ncondition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization after arrival or that will interfere \nwith the alien's ability to provide and care for him or herself, to attend school, or to work upon admission or \n\n\n\nadjustment of status.     (3) The alien's family status--(i) Standard. When considering an alien's family status, DHS \nwill consider the alien's household size, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(d), and whether the alien's household size \nmakes the alien more or less likely to become a public charge.     (ii) [Reserved]     (4) The alien's assets, resources \nand financial status--(i) Standard. When considering an alien's assets, resources, and financial status, DHS will \nconsider whether:     (A) The alien's household's annual gross income is at least 125 percent of the most recent \nFederal Poverty Guidelines based on the alien's household size as defined by Sec.  212.21(d), or if the alien's \nhousehold's annual gross income is under 125 percent of the recent Federal Poverty Guidelines, whether the total \nvalue of the alien's household assets and resources is at least 5 times the difference between the alien's \nhousehold's gross annual income and the Federal Poverty Guideline for the alien's household size;     (B) The alien \nhas sufficient household assets and resources to cover any reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to a \nmedical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere with \nthe alien's ability to provide care for him- or herself, to attend school, or to work; and     (C) The alien has any \nfinancial liabilities or past receipt of public benefits as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b) that make the alien more or less \nlikely to become a public charge.     (ii) Evidence. USCIS' consideration includes but is not limited to the following:     \n(A) The alien's annual gross household income excluding any income from public benefits as defined in 8 CFR \n212.21(b);     (B) Any additional income from individuals not included in the alien's household who physically reside \nwith the alien and whose income will be relied on by the alien to meet the standard at 8 CFR 212.22(b)(4)(i);     (C) \nAny additional income provided to the alien by another person or source not included in the alien's household on a \ncontinuing monthly or yearly basis for the most recent calendar year excluding any income from public benefits as \ndefined in 8 CFR 212.21(b);     (D) The household's cash assets and resources, including as reflected in checking \nand savings account statements covering 12 months prior to filing the application;     (E) The household's non-cash \nassets and resources that can be converted into cash within 12 months, such as net cash value of real estate \nholdings minus the sum of all loans secured by a mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the home; annuities; \nsecurities; retirement and educational accounts; and any other assets that can easily be converted into cash;     (F) \nWhether the alien has:     (1) Applied for or received any public benefit, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), on or after \n[DATE 60 DAYS FROM DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE]; or     (2) Been certified or approved to \nreceive public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), on or after [DATE 60 DAYS FROM DATE OF \nPUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE];     (G) Whether the alien has applied for or has received a fee waiver for an \nimmigration benefit request on or after [DATE 60 DAYS FROM DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE];     \n(H) The alien's credit history and credit score; and     (I) Whether the alien has private health insurance or the \nfinancial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to a medical condition that is likely to \nrequire extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere with the alien's ability to provide care \nfor him- or herself, to attend school, or to work;     (5) The alien's education and skills. (i) Standard. When \nconsidering an alien's education and skills, DHS will consider whether the alien has adequate education and skills \nto either obtain or maintain employment sufficient to avoid becoming a public charge, if authorized for employment.     \n(ii) Evidence. USCIS' consideration includes but is not limited to the following:     (A) The alien's history of \nemployment;     (B) Whether the alien has a high school degree (or its equivalent) or higher education;     (C) \nWhether the alien has any occupational skills, certifications, or licenses; and     (D) Whether the alien is proficient in \nEnglish or proficient in other languages in addition to English.     (6) The alien's prospective immigration status and \nexpected period of admission. (i) Standard. The immigration status that the alien seeks  [[Page 51292]]  and the \nexpected period of admission as it relates to the alien's ability to financially support for himself or herself during the \nduration of their stay, including:     (A) Whether the alien is applying for adjustment of status or admission in a \nnonimmigrant or immigrant classification; and     (B) If the alien is seeking admission as a nonimmigrant, the \nnonimmigrant classification and the anticipated period of temporary stay.     (ii) [Reserved];     (7) An affidavit of \nsupport, when required under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, that meets the requirements of section 213A of the Act \nand 8 CFR 213a--(i) Standard. A sufficient affidavit of support must meet the sponsorship and income requirements \nof section 213A of the Act and comply with 8 CFR 213a.     (A) Evidence. USCIS' consideration includes but is not \nlimited to the following:     (1) The sponsor's annual income, assets, and resources;     (2) The sponsor's relationship \nto the applicant; and     (3) The likelihood that the sponsor would actually provide the statutorily-required amount of \nfinancial support to the alien, and any other related considerations.     (c) Heavily weighed factors. The factors \nbelow will generally weigh heavily in a public charge inadmissibility determination. The mere presence of any one \nenumerated circumstance is not, alone, determinative.     (1) Heavily weighed negative factors. The following \nfactors will generally weigh heavily in favor of a finding that an alien is likely to become a public charge:     (i) The \n\n\n\nalien is not a full-time student and is authorized to work, but is unable to demonstrate current employment, recent \nemployment history or no reasonable prospect of future employment;     (ii) The alien is currently receiving or is \ncurrently certified or approved to receive one or more public benefit, as defined in 212.21(b);     (iii) The alien has \nreceived one or more public benefit, as defined in 212.21(b), within the 36 months immediately preceding the alien's \napplication for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status;     (iv)(A) The alien has been diagnosed with a medical \ncondition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere with the \nalien's ability to provide for him- or herself, attend school, or work; and     (B) The alien is uninsured and has neither \nthe prospect of obtaining private health insurance, or the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable \nmedical costs related to a the medical condition; or     (v) The alien had previously been found inadmissible or \ndeportable on public charge grounds.     (2) Heavily weighed positive factors. The following factors will generally \nweigh heavily in favor of a finding that an alien is not likely to become a public charge:     (i) The alien's household \nhas financial assets, resources, and support of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for a \nhousehold of the alien's household size; or     (ii) The alien is authorized to work and is currently employed with an \nannual income of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for a household of the alien's household \nsize.     (d) Benefits received before [DATE 60 DAYS FROM DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE]. For \npurposes of this regulation, DHS will consider as a negative factor any amount of cash assistance for income \nmaintenance, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), \nState and local cash assistance programs that provide benefits for income maintenance (often called ``General \nAssistance'' programs), and programs (including Medicaid) supporting aliens who are institutionalized for long-term \ncare, received, or certified for receipt, before [DATE 60 DAYS FROM DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL \nRULE], as provided under the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, also known as the 1999 Field Guidance on \nDeportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds. DHS does not consider any other public benefits \nreceived, or certified for receipt, before such date.   Sec.  212.23   Exemptions and waivers for public charge ground \nof inadmissibility.

Sec.  212.24  \nValuation of monetizable benefits.      In determining the cumulative value of one or more monetizable benefits \nlisted in 8 CFR 212.21(b)(1)(ii) for purposes of a public charge inadmissibility determination under 8 CFR 212.22, \nDHS will rely on benefit-specific methodology as follows:     (a) With respect to the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP, formerly called ``Food Stamps''), 7 U.S.C. 2011 to 2036c, DHS will calculate the value \nof the benefit attributable to the alien in proportion to the total number of people covered by the benefit, based on \nthe amount(s) deposited within the applicable period of 12 consecutive months in which the benefits are received in \nthe Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card account;     (b) With respect to the Section 8 Housing Assistance under \nthe Housing Choice Voucher Program, as administered by HUD under 24 CFR part 984; 42 U.S.C. 1437f and \n1437u, DHS will calculate value of the voucher attributable to the alien in proportion to the total number of people \ncovered by the benefit, based on the amount(s) within the applicable period of 12 consecutive months in which the \nbenefits are received;     (c) With respect to Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate \nRehabilitation) under 24 CFR parts 5, 402, 880-884 and 886, DHS will calculate the value of the rental assistance \nattributable to the alien in proportion to the total number of people covered by the benefit, based on the amount(s) \nreceived within the applicable period of 12 consecutive months in which the benefits are received; and     (d) With \nrespect to any cash benefit received by the alien on a household (rather than individual) basis, DHS will calculate \nthe value of the benefit attributable to the alien in proportion to the total number of people covered by the benefit, \nbased on the amount(s) received within the applicable period of 12 consecutive months in which the benefit is \nreceived.  PART 213--PUBLIC CHARGE BONDS  0 6. The authority citation for part 213 is revised to read as \nfollows:      Authority:  8 U.S.C. 1103; 1183; 8 CFR part 2.  0 7. Revise the part heading to read as set forth above. 0 \n8. Revise Sec.  213.1 to read as follows:   Sec.  213.1  Adjustment of status of aliens on submission of a public \ncharge bond.      (a) Inadmissible aliens. In accordance with section 213 of the Act, after an alien seeking \nadjustment of status has been found inadmissible as likely to become a public charge under section 212(a)(4) of the \nAct, DHS may allow the alien to submit a public charge bond, if the alien is otherwise admissible, in accordance \nwith the requirements of 8 CFR 103.6 and this section. The public charge bond submitted on the alien's behalf must \nmeet the conditions set forth in 8 CFR 103.6 and this section.     (b) Discretion. The decision to allow an alien \ninadmissible under section 212(a)(4) of the Act to submit a public charge bond is in DHS's discretion. If an alien has \none or more heavily weighed negative factors as defined in 8 CFR 212.22 present in his or her case, DHS generally \n\n\n\nwill not favorably exercise discretion to allow submission of a public charge bond.     (c) Public Charge Bonds. (1) \nTypes. DHS may require an alien to submit a surety bond, or cash or any cash equivalent, as listed in 8 CFR 103.6, \nand agreement, to secure a bond. DHS will notify the alien of the type of bond that may be submitted. All bonds, \nand agreements covering cash or cash equivalents, as listed in 8 CFR 103.6, to secure a bond, must be executed \non a form designated by DHS and in accordance with form instructions. When a surety bond is accepted, the bond \nmust comply with requirements applicable to surety bonds in 8 CFR 103.6 and this section. If cash or a cash \nequivalent, as listed in 8 CFR 103.6, is being provided to secure a bond, DHS  [[Page 51294]]  must issue a receipt \non a form designated by DHS.     (2) Amount. Any public charge bond, or agreements to secure a public charge \nbond on cash or cash equivalents, as listed in 8 CFR 103.6, must be in an amount decided by DHS, not less than \n$10,000, annually adjusted for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), and \nrounded up to the nearest dollar. The bond amount may not be appealed by the alien or the obligor.     (d) \nConditions of the bond. A public charge bond must remain in effect until the alien naturalizes or otherwise obtains \nU.S. citizenship, permanently departs the United States, or dies, the alien requests cancellation after 5 years of \nbeing a lawful permanent resident, the alien changes immigration status to one not subject to public charge \nground of inadmissibility, and the bond is cancelled in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. An alien on \nwhose behalf a public charge bond has been submitted may not receive any public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR \n212.21(b), after the alien's adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident, until the bond is cancelled in \naccordance with paragraph (g) of this section. An alien must also comply with any other conditions imposed as part \nof the bond.     (e) Submission. A public charge bond may be submitted on the alien's behalf only after DHS notifies \nthe alien and the alien's representative, if any, that a bond may be submitted. The bond must be submitted to DHS \nin accordance with the instructions of the form designated by DHS for this purpose, with the fee prescribed in 8 \nCFR 103.7(b), and any procedures contained in the DHS notification to the alien. DHS will specify the bond amount \nand duration, as well as any other conditions, as appropriate for the alien and the immigration benefit being \nsought. USCIS will notify the alien and the alien's representative, if any, that the bond has been accepted, and will \nprovide a copy to the alien and the alien's representative, if any, of any communication between the obligor and the \nU.S. government. An obligor must notify DHS within 30 days of any change in the obligor's or the alien's physical \nand mailing address.     (f) Substitution. A bond not eligible for cancellation under paragraph (g) of this section must \nbe substituted prior to the expiration of the validity of the bond previously submitted to DHS.     (1) Substitution \nProcess. Either the obligor of the bond previously submitted to DHS or a new obligor may submit a substitute bond \non the alien's behalf. If the bond previously submitted to DHS is a limited duration bond because it expires on a \ndate certain, the substitute bond must be submitted no later than 180 days before the bond previously submitted to \nUSCIS expires and the substitute bond must be valid and effective on or before the day the bond previously \nsubmitted to DHS expires. If the bond previously submitted to DHS is a bond of unlimited duration because it does \nnot bear a specific end date, the substitute bond must specify an effective date. The substitute bond must meet all \nof the requirements applicable to the initial bond as required by this section and 8 CFR 103.6, and if the obligor is \ndifferent from the original obligor, the new obligor must assume all liabilities of the initial obligor. The substitute bond \nmust also cover any breach of the bond conditions which occurred before DHS accepted the substitute bond, in the \nevent DHS did not learn of the breach until after the expiration or cancellation of the bond previously submitted to \nDHS.     (2) Acceptance. Upon submission of the substitute bond, DHS will review the substitute bond for \nsufficiency. If the bond on file has not yet expired, DHS will cancel the bond previously submitted to DHS, and \nreplace it with the substitute bond, provided the substitute bond is sufficient. If the substitute bond was submitted \nbefore the previously submitted bond expired, but is insufficient, DHS will notify the obligor of the substitute bond to \ncorrect the deficiency within the timeframe specified in the notice. If the deficiency is not corrected within the \ntimeframe specified, and the previously submitted bond has not yet expired, the previously submitted bond will \nremain in effect.     (g) Cancellation of the Public Charge Bond. (1) An alien or obligor may request that DHS cancel \na public charge bond if the alien:     (i) Naturalized or otherwise obtained United States citizenship;     (ii) \nPermanently departed the United States;     (iii) Died;     (iv) Reached his or her 5-year anniversary since becoming \na lawful permanent resident; or     (v) Obtained a different immigration status not subject to public charge \ninadmissibility, as listed in 8 CFR 212.23, following the grant of lawful permanent resident status associated with the \npublic charge bond.     (2) Permanent Departure Defined. For purposes of this section, permanent departure means \nthat the alien lost or abandoned his or her lawful permanent resident status, whether by operation of law or \nvoluntarily, and physically departed the United States. An alien is only deemed to have voluntarily lost lawful \npermanent resident status when the alien has submitted a record of abandonment of lawful permanent resident \n\n\n\nstatus, on the form prescribed by DHS, in accordance with the form's instructions.     (3) Cancellation Request. An \nalien must request that a public charge bond be cancelled by submitting a form designated by DHS, in accordance \nwith that form's instructions and the fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b). If a request for cancellation of a public \ncharge bond is not filed, the bond shall remain in effect until the form is filed, reviewed, and a decision is rendered.     \n(4) Adjudication and Burden of Proof. The alien and the obligor have the burden to establish, by a preponderance of \nthe evidence, that one of the conditions for cancellation of the public charge bond listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this \nsection has been met. If DHS determines that the information included in the cancellation request is insufficient to \ndetermine whether cancellation is appropriate, DHS may request additional information as outlined in 8 CFR \n103.2(b)(8). DHS must cancel a public charge bond if DHS determines that the conditions of the bond have been \nmet, and that the bond was not breached, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. For cancellations under \nparagraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section, the alien or the obligor must establish that the public charge bond has not been \nbreached during the 5-year period preceding the alien's fifth anniversary of becoming a lawful permanent resident.     \n(5) Decision. DHS will notify the obligor, the alien, and the alien's representative, if any, of its decision regarding the \nrequest to cancel the public charge bond. When the public charge bond is cancelled, the obligor is released from \nliability. If the public charge bond has been secured by a cash deposit or a cash equivalent, DHS will refund the \ncash deposit to the obligor. If DHS denies the request to cancel the bond, DHS will notify the obligor and the alien, \nand the alien's representative, if any, of the reasons why, and of the right of the obligor to appeal in accordance with \nthe requirements of 8 CFR part 103, subpart A. An obligor may file a motion pursuant to 8 CFR 103.5 after an \nunfavorable decision on appeal. Neither the alien nor the alien's representative may appeal a denial to cancel the \npublic charge bond or file a motion.     (h) Breach--(1) Breach and Claim in Favor of the United States. An  [[Page \n51295]]  administratively final determination that a bond has been breached creates a claim in favor of the United \nStates. Such claim may not be released or discharged by an immigration officer. A breach determination is \nadministratively final when the time to file an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) pursuant to 8 \nCFR part 103, subpart A, has expired or when the appeal is dismissed or rejected.     (2) Breach of Bond \nConditions. (i) The conditions of the bond are breached if the alien has received public benefits, as defined in 8 \nCFR 212.21(b), after the alien's adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident and before the bond is \ncancelled under paragraph (g) of this section. Public benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21(b), received during \nperiods while an alien is present in the United States in a category that is exempt from the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility, as set forth in 8 CFR 212.23, following the initial grant of status as a lawful permanent resident, and \npublic benefits received after the alien obtained U.S. citizenship, may not be considered when determining whether \nthe conditions of the bond have been breached. DHS will not consider any benefits, as defined in 8 CFR 212.21 \n(b)(1) through (b)(3), received by an alien who, at the time of receipt filing, adjudication or bond breach or \ncancellation determination, is enlisted in the U.S. armed forces under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B) or 10 \nU.S.C. 504(b)(2), serving in active duty or in the Ready Reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces, or if \nreceived by such an individual's spouse or child as defined in section 101(b) of the Act.; or     (ii) The conditions of \nthe bond otherwise imposed by DHS as part of the public charge bond are breached.     (3) Adjudication. DHS will \ndetermine whether the conditions of the bond have been breached. If DHS determines that it has insufficient \ninformation from the benefit granting agency to determine whether a breach occurred, DHS may request additional \ninformation from the benefit granting agency. If DHS determines that it has insufficient information from the alien or \nthe obligor, it may request additional information as outlined in 8 CFR part 103 before making a breach \ndetermination. If DHS intends to declare a bond breached based on information that is not otherwise protected from \ndisclosure to the obligor, DHS will disclose such information to the obligor to the extent permitted by law, and \nprovide the obligor with an opportunity to respond and submit rebuttal evidence, including specifying a deadline for \na response. DHS will send a copy of this notification to the alien and the alien's representative, if any.
