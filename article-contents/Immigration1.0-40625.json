{"title": "Florida's deportation law merits study by Georgia", "body": "\nFLORIDA'S \"SEND 'EM BACK\" POLICY for illegal aliens doing jail time deserves a thorough look by Georgia \nofficials. Not only is it cost- effective, but also absolutely necessary.\n\nFlorida is in a fix. Caring for illegal aliens is costing the state more than $ 880 million a year. A significant part of the \ntab is the cost of prison for foreign drug felons. Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles has worked with the U.S. Immigration \nand Naturalization Service to deport 500 illegal aliens serving time in state prisons for drug-related crimes. It is the \nfirst arrangement of its kind. It shouldn't be the last.\n\nGeorgia has nowhere near the number of illegal aliens in prisons that Florida has. Fewer than 500 are foreign-born \nand information is not precise on how many of those are here illegally. But sending even a few back makes sense. \nThe cost of a plane ticket for a foreign prisoner and an accompanying guard is sure to be far less than $ 17,246 \nannual cost to care for a state prison inmate.\n\nThat alone is reason enough, but Florida's policy urges the replication by its neighbor. Deportation is a dreadful \nprospect for illegal aliens, especially if they face prison in countries with facilities far less humane than ours. They \nare bound to move on to other states that do not have the deportation rule. Georgia is the first place they would \ncome to. We had best have the means to move them on or out.\n"}
